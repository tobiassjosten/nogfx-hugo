[1;37m"We did not watch the horizon and our entire continent drowned in blood. We should have seen it coming, we should have acted sooner, we should have..."[0m
[1;37m-- Hilgraf Aman, formerly of Lamaar Bay[0m

[37mLamaar Bay is a relatively large cove on the western shore of Teladir. Possessing a relatively wide stretch of smoothly sloping beach and a small but [0m[37msturdy jetty, Lamaar Bay is an excellent birth for any ship. The high mountains to the southeast and southwest do much to shelter the bay from the storms [0m[37mthat so often plague the Teladiri coastline and the beach is broad enough to allow many ships to rest at anchor comfortably.[0m

[37mThe most instantly recognizable features of Lamaar Bay are the swirls of blood that linger atop the water and can be found imprinted into the sand. These [0m[37mbloody smears are the remnants of some of the most vicious battles in the history of Lithmeria, their legacies stamped into the very land and ocean. In [0m[37mplaces upon the beach, gore and gristle can still be seen lying upon the sands, steadily being picked clean by generations of scavengers.[0m

[37mLamaar Bay owes its bloody history to the Aspalarian invasion in 206 BQ. The Sovereignty forces chose Lamaar Bay as their landing site and Lamaar Bay [0m[37mFortress as the first test of their military against the natives of Teladir. An important beachhead, vital to the continual deployment of Sovereignty [0m[37mtroops in Teladir, Lamaar Bay was contested more fiercely than almost any other stretch of land upon Lithmeria. Waves of Teladiri tribesmen valiantly [0m[37mthrew themselves at the Aspalarian invaders, occasionally succeeding in pushing them back into the shallows and toward the ships beyond.[0m

[37mIn contemporary times, Lamaar Bay is still one of the key strategic locations in western Teladir. Its smooth, easily scaled beaches and sheltering [0m[37mmountains make it a tempting, if somewhat predictable target for raids and troop landings from the Sovereignty. In the shadow of the Lamaar Bay Fortress, [0m[37mthe sands and seagulls wait for the next wave of blood and death to roll in on the rising tide of the Endless Siege.[0m

[1;37m"Sails on the horizon means blood on the walls..."[0m
[1;37m-- Contemporary proverb[0m

[37mThe fortress that overlooks Lamaar Bay is a squat, two story construction carved into the walls of the mountains that surround it. Guarding the tactically [0m[37mpivotal bay beneath it, the Lamaar Bay Fortress is a point of the highest strategic significance to both factions. With the original structure dating back [0m[37mcenturies, the contemporary keep is actually the result of generations of modifications, renovations and improvements at the hands of dozens of different [0m[37martisans and tacticians.[0m

[37mTo reach the fortress from the beach, one must traverse a narrow path wedged between the cliffs. Approaching the gates of keep, attackers find themselves [0m[37mtrapped between two sheltered ballista platforms carved into the stone of the mountains. The gates and corridors beyond are deliberately narrow, allowing [0m[37mdefenders to funnel their attackers and limit any numerical advantage. A series of hidden, one way doors have also been carved into the walls of the [0m[37mmountain above the path approaching the fortress gates, allowing defenders to sally forth into the rear of the besieging force.[0m

[37mThe ground floor of the keep houses the central barracks, sally tunnel, kennels and the stairs leading to the top floor and the basement stores. The [0m[37mstorehouse below the keep contains all manner of foodstuffs, supplies and sundries that allow the castle to survive even the lengthiest of sieges in [0m[37mrelative comfort. The top floor of the keep houses the central hall, where stands the throne of the Lord or Lady of Lamaar Fortress, their bedroom, the [0m[37marmoury, servant&#39;s quarters and an additional barracks.[0m

[37mThe Lamaar Bay Fortress was the scene of the very first direct confrontation between Sovereignty forces and the Teladiri. Since then, it has seen dozens [0m[37mof sieges both successful and unsuccessful as the factions vie for control of the vital bay. The Fortress has changed has so many times that there are now [0m[37mseveral administrators within which simply work for whomever happens to be in control of the fortress at the time. So low is the life expectancy of a [0m[37mpartisan administrator and so highly valued is their expertise in the day to day running of the fortress that both factions have accepted this arrangement.[0m

[37mThis balcony was designed with the singular purpose of housing a small rotatable ballista. A pair of wooden tracks run along the southern edge of the [0m[37msemi-circular balcony allowing a ballista mounted on these tracks to be moved smoothly. The balcony looks as if it&#39;s been kept deliberately free of [0m[37manything that might get in the way or interfere with the work of a gunner in the midst of battle. Above, rows of pavises have been erected and cunningly [0m[37mpainted so as to resemble the cliffs around them. These shields serve the dual purpose of protecting the ballista crew from arrows and hiding them from [0m[37mview. Below and to the west, the road heading toward Lamaar Fortress is visible far into the distance.[0m

[37mThis balcony was designed with the singular purpose of housing a small rotatable ballista. A pair of wooden tracks run along the southern edge of the [0m[37msemi-circular balcony allowing a ballista mounted on these tracks to be moved smoothly. The balcony looks as if it&#39;s been kept deliberately free of [0m[37manything that might get in the way or interfere with the work of a gunner in the midst of battle. Above, rows of pavises have been erected and cunningly [0m[37mpainted so as to resemble the cliffs around them. These shields serve the dual purpose of protecting the ballista crew from arrows and hiding them from [0m[37mview.

[37mLocated within the opulent hallway that stretches from the southwest to the northeast, the staircase that leads below is plain and functional. Constructed [0m[37mof grey stone but with railings of dark brown wood, this staircase has been made deliberately wide to allow servants carrying heavy burdens to work their [0m[37mway down safely and without fuss. The corridor itself is well appointed with rich brown wood paneling covering the stone of the fortress walls. Just above [0m[37mthe staircase to the cellar hangs a large picture of a laden banquet table. To the west an arch labeled &#39;Beast Kennels&#39; rises above the entrance to a [0m[37msmall room. Squinting to the northeast it is possible to make out the end of the opulent corridor as it culminates in a beautiful staircase rising to the [0m[37msecond floor of the fortress.[0m

In large [0m[37mneat bundles on wooden shelves jutting out from the walls, clean quilts and bed linens await pickup. Three bowls filled with water sitting upon the floor [0m[37mindicate that the cellar is home to a trio of domesticated animals.[0m

[1;37m-- Hilgraf Aman, formerly of Lamaar Bay[0m
[37mLamaar Bay is a relatively large cove on the western shore of Teladir. Possessing a relatively wide stretch of smoothly sloping beach and a small but [0m[37msturdy jetty, Lamaar Bay is an excellent birth for any ship. The high mountains to the southeast and southwest do much to shelter the bay from the storms [0m[37mthat so often plague the Teladiri coastline and the beach is broad enough to allow many ships to rest at anchor comfortably.[0m
[37mThe most instantly recognizable features of Lamaar Bay are the swirls of blood that linger atop the water and can be found imprinted into the sand. These [0m[37mbloody smears are the remnants of some of the most vicious battles in the history of Lithmeria, their legacies stamped into the very land and ocean. In [0m[37mplaces upon the beach, gore and gristle can still be seen lying upon the sands, steadily being picked clean by generations of scavengers.[0m
[37mLamaar Bay owes its bloody history to the Aspalarian invasion in 206 BQ. The Sovereignty forces chose Lamaar Bay as their landing site and Lamaar Bay [0m[37mFortress as the first test of their military against the natives of Teladir. An important beachhead, vital to the continual deployment of Sovereignty [0m[37mtroops in Teladir, Lamaar Bay was contested more fiercely than almost any other stretch of land upon Lithmeria. Waves of Teladiri tribesmen valiantly [0m[37mthrew themselves at the Aspalarian invaders, occasionally succeeding in pushing them back into the shallows and toward the ships beyond.[0m
[37mIn contemporary times, Lamaar Bay is still one of the key strategic locations in western Teladir. Its smooth, easily scaled beaches and sheltering [0m[37mmountains make it a tempting, if somewhat predictable target for raids and troop landings from the Sovereignty. In the shadow of the Lamaar Bay Fortress, [0m[37mthe sands and seagulls wait for the next wave of blood and death to roll in on the rising tide of the Endless Siege.[0m

With the original structure dating back [0m[37mcenturies, the contemporary keep is actually the result of generations of modifications, renovations and improvements at the hands of dozens of different [0m[37martisans and tacticians.[0m
[37mTo reach the fortress from the beach, one must traverse a narrow path wedged between the cliffs. Approaching the gates of keep, attackers find themselves [0m[37mtrapped between two sheltered ballista platforms carved into the stone of the mountains. The gates and corridors beyond are deliberately narrow, allowing [0m[37mdefenders to funnel their attackers and limit any numerical advantage. A series of hidden, one way doors have also been carved into the walls of the [0m[37mmountain above the path approaching the fortress gates, allowing defenders to sally forth into the rear of the besieging force.[0m
[37mThe ground floor of the keep houses the central barracks, sally tunnel, kennels and the stairs leading to the top floor and the basement stores. The [0m[37mstorehouse below the keep contains all manner of foodstuffs, supplies and sundries that allow the castle to survive even the lengthiest of sieges in [0m[37mrelative comfort. The top floor of the keep houses the central hall, where stands the throne of the Lord or Lady of Lamaar Fortress, their bedroom, the [0m[37marmoury, servant's quarters and an additional barracks.[0m
[37mThe Lamaar Bay Fortress was the scene of the very first direct confrontation between Sovereignty forces and the Teladiri. Since then, it has seen dozens [0m[37mof sieges both successful and unsuccessful as the factions vie for control of the vital bay. The Fortress has changed has so many times that there are now [0m[37mseveral administrators within which simply work for whomever happens to be in control of the fortress at the time. So low is the life expectancy of a [0m[37mpartisan administrator and so highly valued is their expertise in the day to day running of the fortress that both factions have accepted this arrangement.[0m

[37mIntensely cold, this room houses the Lamaar Fortress garrison's meat supply. The floor is grated and sluiced, allowing blood to run off without building [0m[37mup.
