Path to the bazaar. (#53) (Urban)
The floor is solid rock, whilst above is an endless void. A sign points north, to the bazaar. Deep snow stands in drifts on the ground, a chill wind whipping it about.
Caller Liraya is here, wielding a frost-streaked silver staff in both her hands. Phantom Darnox is here, wielding an ebonsteel-lead katar in each hand.
There is an exit to the north (open door), east, southeast, south, southwest and the west.
