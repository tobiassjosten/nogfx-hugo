ironically peaceful feel to this glade in the middle of the battlefield. A
tangle of roots to the west provides shelter for a small band of mischievous
pigwidgeons, whose boisterous flapping and squawking intermittently break the
surrounding lull. To the southeast, a diffuse silver glow shines through the
surrounding leaves. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. Prince Daem d'Illici,

A jumble of roots.
Large roots come up from the ground here, seemingly attached to no known tree.
Between the trees that surround this tangle of roots, pidgwidgeons peer out
curiously, their stifled giggles betraying their interest for anything that
might trip and fall over the roots. Songs can be heard drifting in from the west
and head out towards the east, making this area quite tumultuous from the
cacophony of sweet song, deafening silence, laughing fae, and the yelps and
howls of those that stumble upon the area. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here.
