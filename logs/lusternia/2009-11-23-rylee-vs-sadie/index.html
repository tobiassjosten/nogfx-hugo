You dive low, shrieking and crying out as you descend into the canopy of the 
forest you have known as home since birth. With talons extended, you kick and 
claw into the midst of writhing thornbeasts and loamadores, struggling as you 
struggle - and you know, instinctively, this fight could be your last. This 
day, this fight, could be the last. A shadow passes high above, and you know 
Crow, great and glorious Crow, fights beside you. The painful death keen of a 
dying harpy fills the air above the forest, and as the canopy rushes towards 
you, the realization settles in that it is your own.

You dive low, shrieking and crying out as you descend into the canopy of the
forest you have known as home since birth. With talons extended, you kick and
claw into the midst of writhing thornbeasts and loamadores, struggling as you
struggle - and you know, instinctively, this fight could be your last. This
day, this fight, could be the last. A shadow passes high above, and you know
Crow, great and glorious Crow, fights beside you. The painful death keen of a
dying harpy fills the air above the forest, and as the canopy rushes towards
you, the realization settles in that it is your own.
