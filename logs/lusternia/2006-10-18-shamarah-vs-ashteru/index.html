Slick pit of warm blood.
Painted in and dripping with coagulated crimson, a lantern overhead dimly 
illuminates a sight not for the faint of heart. Spread across nearly the entire 
chamber, a pit filled with apparently fresh blood bubbles warmly and merrily, 
inviting passerbys for a swim. Along one side of the sanguine pool, surprisingly
clean scrolls and documents written in blood lie neat and organised within a 
red-marked crate. An acrid smell, that of death and iron, rot and decay, marks 
the lukewarm air. Master Anwar n&#39;Lochli is here, wallowing in a pit of blood. 
There are 2 skeleton sentries here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular
monolith is on the ground. Khan Ashteru, Voice behind the Mask is here. He 
wields an iron shield in his left hand and a bloody symbol of pain in his right.
You see a single exit leading south.
