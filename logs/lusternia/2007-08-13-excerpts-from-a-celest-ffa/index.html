Observatory of the starfish. (Pearl of the Amberle.)
Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky. 
Several small orbs of light bathe the room in a warm glow, illuminating a 
five-pointed golden starfish which is meticulously inlaid in to the blue granite
floor of the observation deck. The starfish itself is crafted in unpolished 
orange coral which creates an interesting contrast between the coral and the 
surrounding polished marble of the floor. Each point of the starfish bears the 
name and symbol of a Holy Supernal scribed in inlaid silver resting in a block 
of smooth white marble. Crystalline windows arch above the starfish, creating a 
clear dome which affords an expansive view of the surface of the Inner Sea. The 
waves crest halfway up the dome, allowing the observer a view of the waves as 
well has fleeting glimpses of the sea life below. A small staircase spirals 
downward along the edge of the room, providing a means of egress without 
spoiling the majesty of the room. A wiccan broom floats here, vibrating with 
energy. An oak sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. Ember of the 
Ancestors, Kalodan Faechild, Hierophant of the Wildes is here, shrouded. He

stands before you where once there was a toad, looking slightly disoriented and 
perplexed with his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth.
Kalodan leaves to the ether.

Small ripples lap quietly against the edge of the dome which slices through the 
inky blackness to the southeast. The oppressive quiet of the air is pierced 
occasionally by the creaking of the support cables high above and small drops of
water dripping from the arching underbelly of the platform. A curious current 
flows from underneath the waves, bubbling up to the surface. The current brings 
tiny flecks sand and shell which hit the surface and ripple outward before 
descending again, only to be thrown back up to the surface in a never-ending 
cycle. Faint lights flicker from in the sea from the other side of the dome, 
briefly silhouetting the passing forms of unrecognizable sea life. The shadows 
have been gathered here. A wiccan broom floats here, vibrating with energy.

Swirling eddies of inky black water tug at a cavern opening inset in a large

rises high above the surface of the sea and pierces the platform above, giving 
stability and support to the city as well as a sense of ancient awe. Faint 
gouges and grooves have been scratched into the sheer embankment, as if 
something or someone has tried frantically to escape the dark waters. A wiccan 
broom floats here, vibrating with energy.

series of floating spheres and platforms hanging from an enormous, ivory coral

Observatory of the starfish. (Pearl of the Amberle.)
Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky.
Several small orbs of light bathe the room in a warm glow, illuminating a
five-pointed golden starfish which is meticulously inlaid in to the blue granite
floor of the observation deck. The starfish itself is crafted in unpolished
orange coral which creates an interesting contrast between the coral and the
surrounding polished marble of the floor. Each point of the starfish bears the
name and symbol of a Holy Supernal scribed in inlaid silver resting in a block
of smooth white marble. Crystalline windows arch above the starfish, creating a
clear dome which affords an expansive view of the surface of the Inner Sea. The
waves crest halfway up the dome, allowing the observer a view of the waves as
well has fleeting glimpses of the sea life below. A small staircase spirals
downward along the edge of the room, providing a means of egress without
spoiling the majesty of the room. A wiccan broom floats here, vibrating with
energy. An oak sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. Ember of the

the city's foundation is visible, and past the thick grating, the open sea. The
salty smell of the seawater mingles with the putrid stench of decay, forming a
strange mix of odors that befuddles the nose. Buildings reach up on both sides

only by mold and lichen. A wiccan broom floats here, vibrating with energy.
