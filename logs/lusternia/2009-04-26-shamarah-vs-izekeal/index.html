You have recovered equilibrium.
&lt;5509h 4189m 6157e 3p 22760en 18678w &lt;e->>
A hideous archdemon vomits forth a stream of noxious fluid that strikes Izekeal, coating him with a thick green slime.
A hideous archdemon grabs the shoulders of Izekeal and gutturally whispers something to him in a harsh and unknown language.
&lt;5509h 4189m 6157e 3p 22760en 18678w &lt;e->>
You have recovered balance on all limbs.
&lt;5509h 4189m 6157e 3p 22760en 18692w &lt;eb>>
Izekeal jerks as the iron cross pulls his limbs, resulting in a sickening crunch of bones.
&lt;5509h 4189m 6157e 4p 22760en 18692w &lt;eb>>
A swirling void of darkness opens up before Izekeal, emanating a mad alien presence. He whimpers as tendrils of icy smoke leap out and bore into his body. As the void slams shut, he screams in abject terror, and you cannot help but watch in fascination as his soul is ripped asunder from his body.
[[ For no mere mortal can resist the evil of the Thriller! ]]
The ominous silence lifts as your concentration is broken.
You have slain Izekeal.
Defeated, Izekeal is cast out of the Arena.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
