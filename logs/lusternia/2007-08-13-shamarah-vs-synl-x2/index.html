A split in the path. (road). (Shadowvale Arena.)
The path here splits off into three directions. From the southwest, the soft 
trickle of flowing water calms the area. A rotting piece of lumber lies where 
the paths meet, vaguely resembling a signpost. The vegetation here is quite 
thick, and strange black flowers sprout miraculously from the withered and dry 
bushes. Vines hang down the path towards the water, and the path muddies with 
its approach. Looking to the southeast and northeast, the path seems to continue
on deeper into the forest, the sounds of strange creatures chattering from both 
directions. The shadows have been gathered here. Prince Synl, Hyperborea 
Manifest is here. He wields an pompom in his left hand and a runic 
greatshield of shadowy steel in his right.

A split in the path. (road). (Shadowvale Arena.)
The path here splits off into three directions. From the southwest, the soft 
trickle of flowing water calms the area. A rotting piece of lumber lies where 
the paths meet, vaguely resembling a signpost. The vegetation here is quite 
thick, and strange black flowers sprout miraculously from the withered and dry 
bushes. Vines hang down the path towards the water, and the path muddies with 
its approach. Looking to the southeast and northeast, the path seems to continue
on deeper into the forest, the sounds of strange creatures chattering from both 
directions. The shadows have been gathered here. Prince Synl, Hyperborea 
Manifest is here. He wields an pompom in his left hand and a runic 
greatshield of shadowy steel in his right.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, and southwest.

hinting at its use as an impromptu resting place for the weary...or lost. Dim 
light filters in from the south, where the distant entrance to the tunnels 
strains against the gloom, obscured behind fronds and grasses. The familiar 
noises of the world above grow muffled as the passageway gradually descends. The
main corridor branches off to the northwest and northeast, both options 
appearing eerily unpromising. Prince Synl, Hyperborea Manifest is here. He 
wields an pompom in his left hand and a runic greatshield of shadowy 
steel in his right.

Tangled roots. (lost) (Shadowvale Arena.)
Hanging in thick, fleshy curtains, the roots of some massive tree have choked 
passage through this section of the tunnels. The surroundings - roots, ceiling, 
walls, and floor - are all slick with moisture, water from both the north and 
the southeast pooling under the grasping fingers of the tree's root system. 
Though it is impossible to see beyond the first layer of dangling tendrils, the 
scuffling sounds of small creatures are just audible at the edges of the plant 
mass Prince Synl, Hyperborea Manifest is here, giving off a truly ghastly 
stench. He wields an pompom in his left hand and a runic greatshield of 
shadowy steel in his right.
You see exits leading north and southeast.

Wyrden Wood. (Shadowvale Arena.)
The tall dark trees appear even more foreboding as they fight each other for the
available sunlight. However, it appears clear from the large Ravenwood in the 
south that these are constantly cloaked in shadow, despite the fact that the sun
can clearly be seen from this area. The nearly aphotic forest still seems to be 
alive, possessing a subtle mauve glow from the mists that encompass the area, 
swirling lazily along the forest floor. Within the shadows of the great trees 
smaller, healthier flora can be seen competing for the available nutrients. The 
smaller plants appear to need no light to grow and move with the gentle pushing 
of the isolate mists. To the south can be seen the Great Ravenwood Tree.
You see exits leading north, southeast, south, and southwest.

A large rock looms against the wall here, a smooth depression at its center
hinting at its use as an impromptu resting place for the weary...or lost. Dim
light filters in from the south, where the distant entrance to the tunnels
strains against the gloom, obscured behind fronds and grasses. The familiar
noises of the world above grow muffled as the passageway gradually descends. The
main corridor branches off to the northwest and northeast, both options
appearing eerily unpromising. Prince Synl, Hyperborea Manifest is here. He
wields an pompom in his left hand and a runic greatshield of shadowy
steel in his right.

The tall dark trees appear even more foreboding as they fight each other for the
available sunlight. However, it appears clear from the large Ravenwood in the
south that these are constantly cloaked in shadow, despite the fact that the sun
can clearly be seen from this area. The nearly aphotic forest still seems to be
alive, possessing a subtle mauve glow from the mists that encompass the area,
swirling lazily along the forest floor. Within the shadows of the great trees
smaller, healthier flora can be seen competing for the available nutrients. The
smaller plants appear to need no light to grow and move with the gentle pushing
of the isolate mists. To the south can be seen the Great Ravenwood Tree.
