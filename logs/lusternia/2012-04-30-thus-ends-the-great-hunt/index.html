Inagin has bled to death.

Sir Inagin La&#39;Saet has stopped his own heart, killing himself instantly.

You sense the sweeping gaze of Morbo looking upon you.

(Celest): Ryboi (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "Be well, Celest."
(Celest): Telperion (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "Water cleared."
(Celest): Donato (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "If I did another orgs collegium quest, would I get lessons again?"
(Celest): Staar (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "Thanks grandfather!"

You sense the sweeping gaze of Morbo looking upon you.

Maleran has been reduced to the mental equivalent of a drooling puddle of degenerate sludge by Zenobia, the Queen of Queens.

(Market): Dysolis says, "Seeking spars."

You sense the sweeping gaze of Morbo looking upon you.

The perception of time momentarily slows to a fraction as Atropos snips stray strands and frayed threads upon the Tapestry of Fate, each cut bringing a distant scream. Time rushes forward as the memory fades, yet you retain the knowledge that your fate in Lusternia is far from meeting its end.

Amidst a few tired though enthusiastic blasts of their horn, hunters from around Lusternia begin to make the long trek home, slapping each other on the back and sharing tales of derring-do. Thus ends the Great Hunt!

Ecclesiar Kagato, the Plane Raider shouts, "Congratulations to anyone that earned themself a placing in the Great Hunt."

Sir Inagin La&#39;Saet&#39;s voice reverberates, "Go Celest!"

Iconoclast Delphas n&#39;Kylbar shouts, "Magnagora has again demonstrated her superiority above those lesser cultures which might be found within the Basin of Life. Excellent work."

You sense the sweeping gaze of Morbo looking upon you.

Sidd shouts, "Yes, mindless hunting is always something that should be applauded."

It is now the 15th of Roarkian, 323 years after the Coming of Estarra.

Vadi calls a minor blessing of the Domotheos of Harmony down upon the faeling race.

Sohei Sahmiam m&#39;Viraz shouts, "Mindless hunting? I don&#39;t recall being mindless."

Hand of the Inferno, Ashed, The Enlightened Phoenix shouts, "Isn&#39;t...that the point?"

You shout, "Consider the wizened sage, who recalled being mindless, and was eaten by a caterpillar!"

Iconoclast Delphas n&#39;Kylbar shouts, "Well said, Sidd. That is exactly what we expect to hear from someone who could not even lift a finger to transform themself from lesser to greater form."

Iconoclast Delphas n&#39;Kylbar shouts, "See how easily Magnagoran virtues are proved?"

Ashed tells you, "Ha."

Delphas&#39;s soul has been freed by the divinus energy of Sir Inagin La&#39;Saet.
You see the death occur at a dark cavern.

Uldwar, Seeker of the Gnosis shouts, "We can still drink ya under the table any day a the year!"

(Celest): Near (from Celestia, Plane of Light) says, "Well done, Sir Inagin."
(Celest): Donato (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "I saw that, that was hilarious."
(Celest): You say, "Well played."
(Celest): Donato (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "Woo blackjack is awesome."
(Celest): Donato (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "I won 9k."

Princess Celina Ysav&#39;rai, The Heartless shouts, "Enough, Delphas. Your virtues are as fragile as your backbone, or have you already forgotten your city lacks the courage to remove that flesh sack as the Geomancers have? Sidd exemplifies the Wyrd, and we do not care to listen to your misguiding mewlings."

(Celest): Inagin (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "Anyone want Delphas&#39;s head?"
(Celest): You say, "Sure!"
(Celest): Donato says, "Yeah alright."

A silver golden retriever pads in, dropping the decapitated head of Delphas into your hands before turning around to leave again immediately.

(Celest): You say, "Thank you Sir."
(Celest): Donato says, "Where are the credits from the great hunt I wonder."

You sense the sweeping gaze of Morbo looking upon you.

(Celest): Faragan (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "Pashants is a virtue."

Glowing lines suddenly appear and dance in wildly complex patterns before vanishing, leaving Ushaara in their wake.
A swirl of frigid frost drives the temperature lower as a tubby snow phoenix with icy wings soars into view from the ether.

As Ushaara leaves to the out, the sense of stern authority lifts from the area.
Whispers of warmth flush through your skin as a tubby snow phoenix with icy wings departs in a swirl of frigid frost.

Tipua, the Dread Bull bellows loudly and charges to the ether.

Malignant Maleran d&#39;Murani, Insatiable Hunger shouts, "Oh dear cousin, seems like your thoughts have been clogged with weeds from sitting in the forest too long, and you think we are misguided."

You portal to A Crystal Tower.
You pay 250 sovereigns and receive a flame-shaped sigil.
Thallia arrives in a cone of sparkling light.
Thallia leaves to the ether.
You attach a flame-shaped sigil to the decapitated head of Delphas.
You portal to the Aetherplex Chamber.
You drop the decapitated head of Delphas.

The Aetherplex Chamber.
The spherical chamber is formed from a hollow geode comprised of dozens of precious gemstones. Large jagged formations of rubies, sapphires, diamonds and emeralds line the walls and ceiling.The floor has been cut and polished to a brilliant shine, revealing concentric circles of brilliant colours. Upon close examination of the glassy floor, shimmering reflections briefly glide across its smooth surface of wondrous mansions and abodes. A current of electricity continuously runs throughout this mineral wonder, causing tiny sparks to erratically blossom up and down the crystalline formations. Shimmering with aetheric energy, a bright glowing portal floats here in midair. In the shape of an open palm, a metallic sigil lies here. A giant bat 
hangs here, wings folded about its body and one beady eye open. There are 2 great brindle mastiffs here. A giant black widow studies you carefully from her web. Curled up in a ball, Milla the Peppermint Kitten rests here. The decapitated head of Delphas has been carelessly tossed aside. Miciah n&#39;Kylbar, the Bearer of Gorlityn lingers here, surrounded by a bloody, 
cloying haze. He wields Gorlityn the Tainted in his left hand and a winged star-crested greatshield in his right. You see a sign here instructing you to use the PORTAL command to enter the aetherplex system. There is an aetherways portal here.You see exits leading north (open door), south, out, and through a bright, glowing portal.

Mouth frozen in a grimace of pain, this decapitated head stares at you with wide, blank eyes. 
The skin is pallid and the hair is matted with blood and filth.
It has 4 months of usefulness left.
It weighs about 4 pounds and 6 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Iconoclast Delphas n&#39;Kylbar.
There is a flame-shaped sigil firmly attached.

Do not touch him."'>(Celest): Kagato (from the Prime Material Plane) says, "Well, with less than quarter of a day left until the end of the great hunt, I'm guessing most peoples placings are secure at this point except maybe Shinzas and Inagins - Congratulations to everyone who successfully managed to hold a placing during the event."
