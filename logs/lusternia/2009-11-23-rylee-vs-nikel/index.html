feet in height. A fine, soft, silvery fur covers his entire body. His keen eyes 
are a startlingly deep blue, and deep within then you can almost see the fire 
of passion and loyalty that burns within his soul. His body is a map of scars 
from past battles. He carries his weight like his wolf ancestors, with broad, 
muscular shoulders, his breadth tapering off to the waist, which supports a 
sculpted torso. His fingers are long, and end with short, though sharp,  claws.

diamond collar, 2 etched amethyst rings, a twisted black thorn hoop through his 
right ear, 2 leather frogge upon a black silken sashes, a twisted black thorn
