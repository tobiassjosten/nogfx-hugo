Your somersault takes you out of the room.
Frosted forest in the Moonhart\'s silver mist.
The silvery leaves of a faebush gently billow in the wind. A birch sapling clings tenaciously to the 
ground here.
You see exits leading northeast, east, southeast, and west.
You spring a trap!!
You step on a concealed plate, which springs up and tosses you violently out of the room.
Argent outer reaches of the Moonhart Tree.
The shadows have been gathered here. The silvery leaves of a faebush gently billow in the wind. A 
white marble gravestone stands vigil here, memorializing the death of some poor soul. Admiral 
Nydekion La\'Saet is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and the Bone of 
Mortality in his right. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Sir Inagin La\'Saet, Dagger of 
Dawn lingers here, bursts of multicoloured light randomly exploding in and out of existence. He 
wields a rapier of the Holy Flame in each hand. Squire Veyrzhul Val\'Andra, Ward of Malicia towers 
here. He wields a cheekless klangaxe with both hands. Lady Malicia La\'Saet is here. She wields a 
steel inquisitor rapier in each hand. Ser Shuyin is here, shrouded. He wields a blackened 
justiciar\'s rapier in each hand. Vadi Stormcrow, the Prince is here, shrouded. He wields an athame 
dagger in his left hand and a ravenous shield of black in his right. Lord Sipelus Inalai radiates an 
aura of severity and calm as he lingers here. He wields a screaming demon battlehammer in each hand.
You see exits leading northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.
You spring a trap!!
The ground suddenly falls away from beneath you and you go tumbling into a pit, landing painfully on 
the hard ground.

Your somersault takes you out of the room.
Frosted forest in the Moonhart\'s silver mist.
The silvery leaves of a faebush gently billow in the wind. A birch sapling clings tenaciously to the

You spring a trap!!
You step on a concealed plate, which springs up and tosses you violently out of the room.
Argent outer reaches of the Moonhart Tree.
The shadows have been gathered here. The silvery leaves of a faebush gently billow in the wind. A
white marble gravestone stands vigil here, memorializing the death of some poor soul. Admiral
Nydekion La\'Saet is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and the Bone of
Mortality in his right. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Sir Inagin La\'Saet, Dagger of
Dawn lingers here, bursts of multicoloured light randomly exploding in and out of existence. He
wields a rapier of the Holy Flame in each hand. Squire Veyrzhul Val\'Andra, Ward of Malicia towers
here. He wields a cheekless klangaxe with both hands. Lady Malicia La\'Saet is here. She wields a
steel inquisitor rapier in each hand. Ser Shuyin is here, shrouded. He wields a blackened
justiciar\'s rapier in each hand. Vadi Stormcrow, the Prince is here, shrouded. He wields an athame
dagger in his left hand and a ravenous shield of black in his right. Lord Sipelus Inalai radiates an
aura of severity and calm as he lingers here. He wields a screaming demon battlehammer in each hand.
You see exits leading northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.
You spring a trap!!
The ground suddenly falls away from beneath you and you go tumbling into a pit, landing painfully on
the hard ground.
