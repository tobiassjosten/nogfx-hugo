CURING: chest_wounds with health
The Stairs of the Last Nine. (road).
Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky. Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Far above, the peak touching the sky seems to resonate with power and an unspoken message; if the earth can touch the heavens, then perhaps mortality can touch immortality. Wear and tear have worn the path smooth, revealing that many have attempted the pilgrimage to the top of the mountain, but not hinting at how many have successfully completed it. A statue of a huge monstrous hippogriff with crimson wings stands here, memorializing her noble spirit. The fossilized remains of Rodngar are here. There are 4 bloody ears here.
You see exits leading up, down, and in.
