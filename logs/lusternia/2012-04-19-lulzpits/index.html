This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. Stands bearing polished, gleaming 
weapons face outwards from the central foci of this chamber, illuminated beneath the statue of a 
robed, sword-bearing figure clad in a breastplate marked with a set of scales. Carved from solid 
white coral, the warrior holds one hand aloft, supporting a sphere of brilliant sapphire glass from 
which a brilliant glow emits. Beneath, the blades lie in wait in their gleaming sheaths. A broad 
archway flanked by caryatids opens to the west; a balustrade opens along the outer wall of the 
Armoury to the north, providing a view of the ocean and the roiling stormclouds to the east.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and northwest.

overhead, providing clear illumination to the arched recesses of this massive hall. On either side, 
statues of warriors and martyrs stand, clutching swords and prayer beads to their breasts. In the 
shadowed reaches on either side of the room, two sealed and barred doors rest, heavy with iron bars 
and glowing, silver-chased runes. Alabaster reliefs linger in alcoves along the walls, seamlessly 
melting into the marble walls; small votives in blue glass flicker beneath, illuminating images of 
battle and devotion. Racks of weapons rest betwixt the pillars, polished and gleaming. Staring

A magnificent audience hall.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. Silver-streaked columns flank this 
massive, marble-wrought hall, rising overhead to support an arched ceiling painted with murals of 
the Second Circle in battle against the Soulless. To either side, faceless statues of fallen Gods 
stand, still clutching their weapons to their bosoms. At the centre of the chamber, a tile-inlaid 
floor marches towards a high dias upon which an airy throne stands, flanked at the back by toga-clad 
merian women bearing spears and round shields. A few arched windows open in the walls of the chamber,
 admitting a soft, clear light and the scent of fresh air. There are 4 Even Blade warriors here. The 
twisted remains of Tortuga lie here. A pile of bloody scales and gleaming plate are all that remain 
of this valiant warrior. A bunch of pennyroyal lies on the ground. There are 2 bog myrtle leaves in 
2 groups here.
You see a single exit leading south.

Your soul is flung back to the prime material plane. Slowly, a skeleton forms from the aether, and 
muscles appear upon the bones, bubbling up in a frothy spray of blood. Finally, new skin stretches

Centre of the Necropolis.
A magnificent chandelier featuring the Magnagoran Pantheon hangs high overhead here, bathing the 
area in sable and sanguine light. Rising up from cracks in the floor, the Megalith of Doom towers 
above everything here, polluting the air with its foul fumes. The Keeper of the Megalith stands here 
radiating a tainted presence. There are 2 wights here. A platinum eye sigil is here. Gibbering to 
itself, a ghoul looks about itself here with a malevolent gleam in its eyes. A zombie sways back and 
forth here, dripping chunks of flesh. A painting of a massive, bubbling sore is proudly exhibited on 
a nearby wall. Swirling eddies of chaotic ether dance around a marble shrine to Morgfyre that holds 
a crystal model of the planispheres. There are 25 Ur'Guard Grand Marshals here. In the shape of an 
open palm, a metallic sigil lies here. A grotesque ghast squats here, dragging its taloned hands on 
the ground. Veradin Munsia D'cente` is here. She wields a twisted staff in her left hand and a 
hammer of blackened iron in her right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.
An Ur'Guard Grand Marshal says, &#34;I am ready for any encounter, Tortuga. Just tell me when and where.">[System]: Target set: MERIAN.ff

Sanctuary of Blades.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. Stands bearing polished, gleaming
weapons face outwards from the central foci of this chamber, illuminated beneath the statue of a
robed, sword-bearing figure clad in a breastplate marked with a set of scales. Carved from solid
white coral, the warrior holds one hand aloft, supporting a sphere of brilliant sapphire glass from
which a brilliant glow emits. Beneath, the blades lie in wait in their gleaming sheaths. A broad
archway flanked by caryatids opens to the west; a balustrade opens along the outer wall of the
Armoury to the north, providing a view of the ocean and the roiling stormclouds to the east.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and northwest.

overhead, providing clear illumination to the arched recesses of this massive hall. On either side,
statues of warriors and martyrs stand, clutching swords and prayer beads to their breasts. In the
shadowed reaches on either side of the room, two sealed and barred doors rest, heavy with iron bars
and glowing, silver-chased runes. Alabaster reliefs linger in alcoves along the walls, seamlessly
melting into the marble walls; small votives in blue glass flicker beneath, illuminating images of
battle and devotion. Racks of weapons rest betwixt the pillars, polished and gleaming. Staring

A magnificent audience hall.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. Silver-streaked columns flank this
massive, marble-wrought hall, rising overhead to support an arched ceiling painted with murals of
the Second Circle in battle against the Soulless. To either side, faceless statues of fallen Gods
stand, still clutching their weapons to their bosoms. At the centre of the chamber, a tile-inlaid
floor marches towards a high dias upon which an airy throne stands, flanked at the back by toga-clad
merian women bearing spears and round shields. A few arched windows open in the walls of the chamber,
admitting a soft, clear light and the scent of fresh air. There are 4 Even Blade warriors here. The
twisted remains of Tortuga lie here. A pile of bloody scales and gleaming plate are all that remain
of this valiant warrior. A bunch of pennyroyal lies on the ground. There are 2 bog myrtle leaves in
2 groups here.

In a pit at before the Armoury.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. Two archways supported by armour-clad
warriors rest to either side of this semi-circular courtyard, providing entrance into the Armoury. A
single statue rests at the centre, in the shadow of the great hall; faceless, the figure is carved
from solid white coral, and bears an axe upon his muscled shoulder. From here, a set of marble
stairs descends, flanked by kneeling warriors bearing spheres of sea-coloured glass - in every
direction, the ground gives way to clouds that float above an endless, green-lit sea.

In a pit at a magnificent audience hall.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. Silver-streaked columns flank this
massive, marble-wrought hall, rising overhead to support an arched ceiling painted with murals of
the Second Circle in battle against the Soulless. To either side, faceless statues of fallen Gods
stand, still clutching their weapons to their bosoms. At the centre of the chamber, a tile-inlaid
floor marches towards a high dias upon which an airy throne stands, flanked at the back by toga-clad
merian women bearing spears and round shields. A few arched windows open in the walls of the chamber,
admitting a soft, clear light and the scent of fresh air. A gruesome scalp lies decomposing on the
ground.

Centre of the Necropolis.
A magnificent chandelier featuring the Magnagoran Pantheon hangs high overhead here, bathing the
area in sable and sanguine light. Rising up from cracks in the floor, the Megalith of Doom towers
above everything here, polluting the air with its foul fumes. The Keeper of the Megalith stands here
radiating a tainted presence. There are 2 wights here. A platinum eye sigil is here. Gibbering to
itself, a ghoul looks about itself here with a malevolent gleam in its eyes. A zombie sways back and
forth here, dripping chunks of flesh. A painting of a massive, bubbling sore is proudly exhibited on
a nearby wall. Swirling eddies of chaotic ether dance around a marble shrine to Morgfyre that holds
a crystal model of the planispheres. There are 25 Ur'Guard Grand Marshals here. In the shape of an
open palm, a metallic sigil lies here. A grotesque ghast squats here, dragging its taloned hands on
the ground. Veradin Munsia D'cente` is here. She wields a twisted staff in her left hand and a
hammer of blackened iron in her right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.
An Ur'Guard Grand Marshal says, "I am ready for any encounter, Tortuga.
