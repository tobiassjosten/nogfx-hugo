Probably the strangest of the fae, no one has actually ever seen the face or 
body of a pigwidgeon. The sleeves and pants of its voluminous clothing go well 
beyond its hands and feet, covering them with the frayed material. Shadows 
cling to the copious amounts of cloth and to the floppy hat atop its head. It 
is not even clear whether this odd fae is a biped or quadruped as it spends as 
much time on two legs as it does on four.
A pigwidgeon bound in shadows seems to be unafraid.
He weighs about 13 pounds.
He is loyal to Spinner Rylee, Disciple of Eventide.
A pigwidgeon bound in shadows is holding:
Nothing.

This vial has been fashioned by a highly trained artist from jade. There is a 
small stopper at the mouth.
It has 141 months of usefulness left.
It weighs 2 ounce(s).

A patch of black roses. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Towering dark trees fight each other for any available sunlight here, a subtle 
mauve glow reflected upon them from the mists that encompass the forest, 
churning slowing at ground level. The usual lesser plants have been cleared in 
this area, replaced by large rose bushes. Glistening black roses dot the 
shrubbery, lending a striking glory to this small area of struggle. The rose 
bushes seem to flourish in the shadows here, swaying with the gentle pushing of 
the swirling mists. To the west the Great Ravenwood Tree looms menacingly 
overhead. A wall of briars has grown here in a tangle, blocking passage to the 
northwest. A hemlock sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here.

A patch of black roses. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Towering dark trees fight each other for any available sunlight here, a subtle 
mauve glow reflected upon them from the mists that encompass the forest, 
churning slowing at ground level. The usual lesser plants have been cleared in 
this area, replaced by large rose bushes. Glistening black roses dot the 
shrubbery, lending a striking glory to this small area of struggle. The rose 
bushes seem to flourish in the shadows here, swaying with the gentle pushing of 
the swirling mists. To the west the Great Ravenwood Tree looms menacingly 
overhead. A wall of briars has grown here in a tangle, blocking passage to the 
northwest. A hemlock sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here.
You see exits leading southwest, west, and northwest.

At the base of the Great Ravenwood Tree. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Large roots spread in all directions from the largest tree in this forest, 
monumental enough that entrance seems possible by climbing up the roots and 
into the dark hole above. The mighty behemoth of a tree strongly resembles the 
Master Ravenwood tree within the Glomdoring forest, and yet feels as though it 
is just a shell in comparison to the power that the original contains. Pathways 
from all directions lead to this central tree, giving access to all areas of 
the Wyrden forest. Sensations of darkness and terror emanate pulse from the 
large nest atop the massive form, enhanced by a stark sense of foreboding 
emanating from the dark entry just above the roots. There are 2 briar walls 
here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest,

Night's Shelter within the Great Ravenwood Tree. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Deep within this large Ravenwood a hollow chamber has been carved, providing 
protection and a means to climb to the top of the great tree. The room is 
encompassed in an inky blackness so thick that sight is utterly obscured, 
leaving only the other senses to give any indication of the surroundings. Near 
the top of the chamber, a nearly inscrutable difference in the depth of the 
shadows betrays an opening above, while a constant, subtle breeze allows hints 
at the exit. Mixed with the fresh scent of the Wyrden forest, the strong stench 
of blood and severed flesh fills the dark chamber, creating a pungent contrast 
to the stale scent of the dried out wood that defines the space. Large knots 
and gnarled wood provide ample footing from which to continue upward or to face 
a foe in battle

At the base of the Great Ravenwood Tree. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Large roots spread in all directions from the largest tree in this forest, 
monumental enough that entrance seems possible by climbing up the roots and 
into the dark hole above. The mighty behemoth of a tree strongly resembles the 
Master Ravenwood tree within the Glomdoring forest, and yet feels as though it 
is just a shell in comparison to the power that the original contains. Pathways 
from all directions lead to this central tree, giving access to all areas of 
the Wyrden forest. Sensations of darkness and terror emanate pulse from the 
large nest atop the massive form, enhanced by a stark sense of foreboding 
emanating from the dark entry just above the roots. There are 2 briar walls 
here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, northwest, and up.

At the base of the Great Ravenwood Tree. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Large roots spread in all directions from the largest tree in this forest, 
monumental enough that entrance seems possible by climbing up the roots and 
into the dark hole above. The mighty behemoth of a tree strongly resembles the 
Master Ravenwood tree within the Glomdoring forest, and yet feels as though it 
is just a shell in comparison to the power that the original contains. Pathways 
from all directions lead to this central tree, giving access to all areas of 
the Wyrden forest. Sensations of darkness and terror emanate pulse from the 
large nest atop the massive form, enhanced by a stark sense of foreboding 
emanating from the dark entry just above the roots. There are 2 briar walls 
here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, northwest, and up.

bushes seem to flourish in the shadows here, swaying with the gentle pushing of
the swirling mists. To the west the Great Ravenwood Tree looms menacingly

At the base of the Great Ravenwood Tree. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Large roots spread in all directions from the largest tree in this forest,
monumental enough that entrance seems possible by climbing up the roots and
into the dark hole above. The mighty behemoth of a tree strongly resembles the
Master Ravenwood tree within the Glomdoring forest, and yet feels as though it
is just a shell in comparison to the power that the original contains. Pathways
from all directions lead to this central tree, giving access to all areas of
the Wyrden forest. Sensations of darkness and terror emanate pulse from the
large nest atop the massive form, enhanced by a stark sense of foreboding
emanating from the dark entry just above the roots. There are 2 briar walls
here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest,

Night's Shelter within the Great Ravenwood Tree. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Deep within this large Ravenwood a hollow chamber has been carved, providing
protection and a means to climb to the top of the great tree. The room is
encompassed in an inky blackness so thick that sight is utterly obscured,
leaving only the other senses to give any indication of the surroundings. Near
the top of the chamber, a nearly inscrutable difference in the depth of the
shadows betrays an opening above, while a constant, subtle breeze allows hints
at the exit. Mixed with the fresh scent of the Wyrden forest, the strong stench
of blood and severed flesh fills the dark chamber, creating a pungent contrast
to the stale scent of the dried out wood that defines the space. Large knots
and gnarled wood provide ample footing from which to continue upward or to face
a foe in battle

At the base of the Great Ravenwood Tree. (Shadowvale Arena.)
Large roots spread in all directions from the largest tree in this forest,
monumental enough that entrance seems possible by climbing up the roots and
into the dark hole above. The mighty behemoth of a tree strongly resembles the
Master Ravenwood tree within the Glomdoring forest, and yet feels as though it
is just a shell in comparison to the power that the original contains. Pathways
from all directions lead to this central tree, giving access to all areas of
the Wyrden forest. Sensations of darkness and terror emanate pulse from the
large nest atop the massive form, enhanced by a stark sense of foreboding
emanating from the dark entry just above the roots. There are 2 briar walls
here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest,
west, northwest, and up.

into the dark hole above. The mighty behemoth of a tree strongly resembles the

is just a shell in comparison to the power that the original contains. Pathways
from all directions lead to this central tree, giving access to all areas of
the Wyrden forest. Sensations of darkness and terror emanate pulse from the
large nest atop the massive form, enhanced by a stark sense of foreboding
emanating from the dark entry just above the roots. There are 2 briar walls
here.
