The winding trail comes into the open here before the rocky face of a mountain. To the west, a small opening appears to descend deep into the heart of the mountain. Leading out of the mountains here is the beginning of an established road, with a few stones laid intentionally toward the southeast. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the southeast. There are 2 walls of wind here. A brown striped, roly-poly pony with a long tail stands here quietly. Surrounded by white lightning, a violet thunderbird spreads his leathery wings here, yellow eyes blazing with a keen intellect. Crimson Holocaust, Veracruz Feyranti, Transmogrifier is here, shrouded. He wields Gauntlets of Gnosis in his right hand. Private Nyla D'cente` is here, shrouded. He wields an opaque klangaxe of shifting sands with both hands. Solanis Talnara, Dancer in Solitude is here, fluid-like motes of effervescent light floating about his form. He wields an athame dagger in his left hand and a golden sunburst shield in his right. Kio Peulus, Whisper of the Wyrd is here, shrouded. He wields a lordly ebon viola of Dark Spirit in his left hand and a graceful phoenix shield in his right.

Leading out of the mountains here is the beginning of an established road, with a few stones laid intentionally toward the southeast. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the southeast. There are 2 walls of wind here. A brown striped, roly-poly pony with a long tail stands here quietly. Surrounded by white lightning, a violet thunderbird spreads his leathery wings here, yellow eyes blazing with a keen intellect. Crimson Holocaust, Veracruz Feyranti, Transmogrifier is here, shrouded. He wields Gauntlets of Gnosis in his right hand. Private Nyla D'cente` is here, shrouded. He wields an opaque klangaxe of shifting sands with both hands. Kio Peulus, Whisper of the Wyrd is here, shrouded. He wields a lordly ebon viola of Dark Spirit in his left hand and a graceful phoenix shield in his right. Solanis Talnara, Dancer in Solitude is here, fluid-like motes of effervescent light floating about his form. He wields an athame dagger in his left hand and a golden sunburst shield in his right.

Banks of clouds roil about here. Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The wide stretch of desolate field is open here at what seems to be a three-way intersection of the faint paths that are carved into the landscape. Squatting on the ground is a large, ugly toad covered in warts.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and southwest.
5813h, 6032m, 4908e, 10p, 22476en, 25360w esSixk-&lt;\ br>Your aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
In order to put the pathetic life of a warty toad out of its misery, you lift a foot and bring it down mightily on its bloated green body.

A warty toad's back breaks under the weight of a heavy foot, its innards spilling out and leaving a messy stain on the ground.
A warty toad has been slain by Solanis.
A warty toad wobbles about uncertainly and turns a pale shade of green before suddenly stretching and transforming into a demigod. Shaking his head, Veracruz stands before you where once there was a toad, looking slightly disoriented and perplexed with his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth.
Veracruz leaves to the ether, emanating an aura of immense power.
The Red Team has been annihilated!
