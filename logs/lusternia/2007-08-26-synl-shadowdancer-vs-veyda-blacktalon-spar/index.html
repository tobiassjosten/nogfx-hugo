A grove of hemlock.
Wicked trees of hemlock sprawl across one another in a complex pattern, 
poisoning the air with their thick scent. Within the shadows of the greater 
forestry, smaller, healthier ferns, trees and plants can be seen competing for 
the available nutrients. The smaller plants appear to need no light to grow, and
move with the gentle pushing of the isolate mists. Here and there the thick 
clusters of hemlock disperse to leave small clear patches of ferns and brume, 
where one so inclined can meditate and relax within its presence. Permanently 
growling at all around, Black Shuck, the Darkhound stands here.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.
