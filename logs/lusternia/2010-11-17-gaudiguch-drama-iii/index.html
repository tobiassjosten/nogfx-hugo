So the fall began, a quiet and terrible thing.

2010/11/11 10:56:08 - Arix quit the city.
The sensible ones would, inevitably, leave before it was too late.

2010/11/11 16:26:39 - Lera quit the city.
2010/11/11 16:27:26 - Aleria citizened Arcanis.
Those that were shrubbed for multiplaying as they tried to get Kalin out of office were suddenly, magically, let into the city without complaint.

2010/11/11 17:12:09 - Credits: -5. Transfer to Maestra. Reason: sale.
2010/11/11 17:36:19 - Briaria declared that Anyania is no longer an enemy. Reason: being &#34;loud&#34; in Gaudiguch is not a crime or most of the city would be enemied.
I remember Anyania. She was the only one with a fair chance of winning - she almost did. Then she lost, and immediately quit the city. Nice patriotism.
P.S: I'm not the epitome of RP, but if you're going to stay in Kalikai's order, you don't go to Magnagora, which hosts all the Divine she gave a tactical ass whooping.

2010/11/11 18:18:11 - Ayrna donated 15000 gold.
2010/11/11 18:19:12 - Credits: -5. Transfer to Ayrna. Reason: sale.
2010/11/11 18:21:03 - Zeldin stepped out of the Portal of Fate as a citizen.
2010/11/11 18:24:24 - Liwase donated 20000 gold.
2010/11/11 18:33:16 - Credits: -5. Transfer to Liwase. Reason: sale.
2010/11/11 18:51:01 - Briaria declared that Sakr is no longer an enemy. Reason: full council decision to unenemy Sakr.
2010/11/11 19:35:36 - Relk voted to uncitizen Rodngar.
2010/11/11 19:35:52 - Briaria voted to uncitizen Rodngar.
2010/11/11 19:36:08 - Aleria kicked out Rodngar.
2010/11/11 19:37:18 - Aleria declared Rodngar to be a formal enemy. Reason: precautions. He is a potential threat since he has made said threats.
Ding, dong the witch is dead.
(At least he's having fun in Hallifax)

Next up, installing your new overlords into power:

2010/11/17 03:09:45 - Briaria appointed Rikati as Minister of Trade.
2010/11/17 03:09:51 - Briaria appointed Reimi as Minister of Cultural Affairs.
2010/11/17 03:09:55 - Lyria confirmed Reimi as Minister of Cultural Affairs.
2010/11/17 03:09:56 - Aleria confirmed Rikati as Minister of Trade.
2010/11/17 03:09:58 - Briaria appointed Iytha as Librarian.
2010/11/17 03:10:02 - Lyria confirmed Iytha as Librarian.
2010/11/17 03:10:18 - Briaria appointed Nataely as Ambassador.
2010/11/17 03:10:22 - Lyria confirmed Nataely as Ambassador.

Reimi's alright. She would have saved the Illuminati GC or GA elections if she could, but she didn't have enough playing time logged.
Iytha's a wildcard.
Nataely was one of the alt brigade. ( more on that later )
Rikati ... wait, who?


2010/11/14 18:35:11 - Aleria cityfavoured Rikati for: excellent work within our city.
2010/11/15 02:23:11 - Aleria cityfavoured Rikati for: Just being an asset to our city.

Whelp Rikati (Male Furrikin).
He is 18 years old, having been born on the 22nd of Dioni, 263 years after the Coming of Estarra.
He is ranked 590th in Lusternia.
He is an extremely credible character.
He is a Proletarian in the Free Commonwealth of Gaudiguch.
He is an Itinerant Traveler in the Fellowship of Explorers.
He is a graduate of the Order of the Secret Flame (honours).
He is considered to be approximately 55% of your might.
He is not currently active in any family.
He did subdue the insane residents of the i'Xiia asylum.
He has scribed the tales of old Celest into the Tome of Remembrance.
He helped the shaman Rynak vanquish the ghost-wolves of Verasavir Valley.
He has earned the title of Savior to the Gnomes.
He has earned the title of Hero to the Finks.

Seems to be an alt. Interestingly, he was one of the first appointed, and completely passed over for confirmation by Lyria, who controls the only Ama'rua-free guild in the city. For now. No way to verify, though, unless there were any good Templars left that could check his guild score. (There aren't) While we're at it, here's how to identify an Ama'rua:

|   The Ambitious Dreamers Alliance                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Look for that. Ambitious Dreamers indeed!

I did some hunting over the sudden quitfest from the previous drama log:


2010/11/05 00:36:31 - Alaya quit the city.
2010/11/05 00:49:30 - Sivali quit the city.
2010/11/05 00:58:46 - Nidra quit the city.
2010/11/05 01:09:55 - Dristan quit the city.
2010/11/05 01:17:31 - Valis quit the city.
2010/11/05 01:46:15 - Siniaba quit the city.

And I managed to find that...

Nidra = Nataely (Nidra's shop magically cleared and went up for sale a few moments prior)
Alaya = Aleria
Dristan/Valis/Rireayi = Boden or Relk
Sinabia = Dysolis/Seneth

All of these characters were in the Illuminati.

After I resigned, there were two contestants for the GM position: Aiyana and Aleria.
Aleria won by 8 points.

I often wondered why, even at 3AM, I would see anywhere from 3 to 5 people offplane on GWHO, with myself and Arix being the only ones on Prime. I knew one of them was likely to be Kalin playing WoW or sleeping. But the rest? I guess they were alts.

If this sort of thing was cracked down on sooner...
Jazella/Athine/Melantha would have never taken over Celest. (She's busy trying to screw Magnagora now, last I heard)
Aleria would have lost GM.
Xypher would have retained GA, but magically was dethroned by Briaria in spite of all the work he did.

As for Seneth/Dysolis? His work to become Mayor of his long-coveted city failed. Miserably.

Title:                                                      (Closed)
   Election for Leader of Gaudiguch

Description:
   Hoping to fill the vacancy in the position of Mayor of
   Gaudiguch, this vote has been called. The following individuals
   believe they can better perform the duties required of the
   position.

Choices:
     1.  (252) Briaria
     2.  (87) Caerulo
     3.  (64) Ayrna
     4.  (16) Arix
     5.  (15) Mortexia
     6.  (13) Seneth
************************************************************************

Ass end of last place. If Briaria's numbers don't look suspicious I'll be damned, but that's besides the point.

2010/11/15 01:14:45 - Seneth quit the city.

Seneth left Gaudiguch. On the same day, Dysolis returns to activity and tries to join Gaudiguch. He is almost unanimously rejected. Rage ensues. Pardon the Delportoise, but seriously - could you be any less unsubtle with this, you obsessive fuck?

I noticed that Tyrad is coming back from inactivity, too.

&#34;Tyrad's last login was 0 days ago.&#34;

The guy is probably my greatest shame as far as political manipulation is concerned. His largely incoherent challenge eventually lead to him being locked in my office and my breaking several admin rules in the process (I really shouldn't have done that) and I wouldn't be surprised if someone reading this managed to get their hand on a log of the incident. Either way, Tyrad is the guy who contested with the claim that 'I know from an admin that you're using OOC metagaming to get me kicked out of the city', insinuating that this admin was first Lisaera and then Lyreth. He also believed in the Sarrasri's Illuminati Alt conspiracy theory. Seriously - she did not have an Illuminati alt. She was a Templar, always was. If you took issue with her envoying a Gaudiguchian skill, then get off your whining arse, contact your patron and get her replaced - not that Moondancers need any buffs. :|

At this point, Briaria is sometimes heard complaining that whenever she tries to direct the city and organize a plan, Aleria decides to ignore her and go off and do her own thing. Is this at all surprising?

One final rant, one thing that pisses me off on a personal level: Keeno McFluffin the Chaos Panda. Seriously? If you are going to have what may be the most badass GM position in the game - the leader of the oldest and esoteric organization in the Basin, wielder of ancient lore and author of history's most subtle and grand manipulations - you do not faff about with a FLUFFY CHAOS PANDA. Bah!

Like Othero said - this place really should be raided into the ground. I imagine I'll one of the people to do it.">This entry would be more interesting, but a really long power outage killed whatever I had previously written up but left unsaved. I ended up absent for any drama during Rodngar's departure... and in truth, everything has quieted down for now.
