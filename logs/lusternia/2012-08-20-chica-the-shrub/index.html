(Gaudiguch): Chica says, "Chica kneels down before you and pulls down your pants. She grasps her penis with one hand while looking at you smiling. She winks and then licks the head of it a little with the tip of her tongue. She then squeezes the base of it with her hand and wraps her lips around it swallowing it whole. She then begins bobbing her head up and down. Slow at first, then faster, then slower again. She pumps her throbbing cock wildly with both of her free hands as she sucks her growing member. All of the sudden she grabs you and flips you over, shoving her massive cock deep into your booty. She rides you like a wild stallion and moans loudly. After a few minutes of hot steamy pounding she pulls out and jizzes all over the back of your luscious round rump. Blamo!"
