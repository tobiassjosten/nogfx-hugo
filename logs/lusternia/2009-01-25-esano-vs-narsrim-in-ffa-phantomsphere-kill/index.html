A dark and desolate cavern. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
The corrosiveness of the taint sickens the land. A duststorm rages here. The cavern is dimly lit by the last
 traces of light that flow through the cave entrance to the northeast. Large crystal formations grow on the
 walls, eager to snag or cut unwary adventurers. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. A pile of rubble lies
 here, blocking the way southeast. A pile of rubble lies here, blocking the way west.

Clouds of sulfurous fumes rise up from the bowels of the earth.
A violent tremor rocks the land, causing the earth to shake and the ground to buck beneath your feet.
A deep, foreboding hum emanates from the tainted earth, and then Narsrim is suddenly slammed into the ground
 by an irresistable force.
Dust clouds rise as the earth shifts and sharp rocks slide and bounce, some flying into the air. Narsrim
 yelps in pain as several of them smash into him.
