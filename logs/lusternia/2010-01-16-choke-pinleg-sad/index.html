Winds of change.
Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky. A birch sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. Spirit Warden Xenthos An'Ryshe, the Ebon Strategist is here. He wields a baleful rapier of darkened steel in each hand. Narynth Ysav'rai towers here, shrouded. She wields a mystic cudgel in her left hand and a wyrden shield with the image of a drum in her right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and southwest.

A slaugh strokes a cold, beautiful finger across your cheek, and a cold sweat breaks out upon your brow.
