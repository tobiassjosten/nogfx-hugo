You tell Grandmaster Ryboi D&#39;Varden, "Lord Eventru wishes to contribute a monthly pension of 15,000 gold a month in addition to all that New Celest will be giving me."

(Celest): You say, "The opinion of one who ordered me to fight with the Taint matters less than you 
could possibly know."

(Celest): Eventru says, "Even in your petulance We have stood in your defense and defended you to the Star Council, even as some call for you to be burned where you stand."

(Celest): You say, "Yes, I know how badly you&#39;ve tried to win me back to your side so that I wouldn&#39;t reveal your treachery, but as always, I stand for the Light - not You, not the corrupt bureaucrats of New Celest. The Supernals alone, Eventru. I doubt you&#39;ll ever understand such devotion, though."

(Celest): Eventru says, "We have no desire for you at Our side, Talkan. Instead We have advised an opportunity for redemption, in accordance with Aison&#39;s most heartfelt prayers to see you saved."

(Celest): Eventru says, "You are a sad and wretched creature, twisted by your own loathing and hatred and misconceptions. Our heart aches that you would blame Us for this atrocity that you have become, though We know such lies to be false. Still, worse, you defame the name of Our most cherished half-formed with your blasphemous words."

(Celest): You say, "Please, continue Eventru. Lay one crime against me. What was it? Leaving New Celest? Where is that in the laws as a crime? Standing for the Light every day? Is this a crime now? Have you successfully warped the leadership of this once great city so that it views those who devote themselves to the Supernals as criminals?"

(Celest): You say, "No, Eventru, it was you and you alone that drove me from this city once, long ago. You ordered me, from your own lips, to ally with Magnagora, to use their power to fight the forests."

(Celest): Eventru says, "You stood as Prince of this city, then offered its power, Nexus and Holy Celestia to the highest bidder, and pandered it to Magnagora."

(Celest): You say, "I did not and will not ever do such a thing, and you better get used to it."

(Celest): Eventru says, "You stole from its financial reserves, emptied the Pool of its power on the promise of defending its holdings, then abandoned it."

(Celest): You say, "And you stole from its spirit. You are the blasphemer, the unholy one, the taint&#39;s pet. What has Fain ordered you to do now, Eventru? Once you healed the Supernals I hold dear. But now you work with the Red Masque in their downfall. Be gone, treacherous one! And speak to me no more! My ears will not hear your poison!"

(Celest): Eventru says, "Power that you gained with Our support, and a sad deed that We regret, supporting you. Many did nothing but support you, most out of love, Our most radiant of selves included. You spat in Our face, and the faces of all the Light and Celest and the very name of Celestia."

(Celest): Eventru says, "Madness claims your tongue, poor, pitiable wretch. We shall not look happily upon the day you are cast from the walls of this shining city, and you discover the Saints of Celestia themselves cannot bring themselves to sully their mouths by speaking your name."

(Celest): You say, "I&#39;ve been outside these walls, you fool. Methrenton and I held converse daily even then. Your arrogance assumes that only in YOUR presence can one be with the Light. Heresy!"

(Celest): Eventru says, "You speak not to Methrenton, but to the mad voice of your own broken heart. Look now, children of the Light, and know what becomes of those who slip from pride into arrogance, grace into disgrace, purity into corruption, hope into desperate, empty sorrow."

(Celest): Eventru says, "It is that whose name sullies the mouth that speaks it, and so the Light will not utter your name, nor shall We."

You feel suddenly as if your throat is thickly blocked, and attempt to clear it with a cough, only to discover you can barely rasp and have lost the power of speech altogether. An abrupt insight tells you that this must be a punishment from Eventru, Crown of the Exalted.

(Academy): Eventru says, "Talkan was, Tahtim, once a high ranked member of Our Order, and an Ascendent of New Celest, as well as their leader. He betrayed the city, offered to sell it to the Taint, abandoned his home, losing Ascendant and all the power that went with it."
