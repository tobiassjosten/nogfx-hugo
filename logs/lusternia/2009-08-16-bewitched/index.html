Runed pathway.
The loud, echoing caw of crows permeates the air, filling the area with a feeling of dread from a war shrine of Viravain nearby. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. Hanging suspended from the boughs overhead, beaten metal runes clang against one another in an eerie, discordant rhythm. Strange dolls lie propped against the bases of the nearby trees with their arms clasped around the trunks in macabre hugs. The entire area whispers sibilant words that chill the very air, the source seemingly coming from the south.  A bone chilling cold seeps from the ground and leaves ghostly footprints along the pathway. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Supplicant Dartien is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand. Sipelus is here, shrouded.

look
Runed pathway.
The loud, echoing caw of crows permeates the air, filling the area with a feeling of dread from a war shrine of Viravain nearby. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. Hanging suspended from the boughs overhead, beaten metal runes clang against one another in an eerie, discordant rhythm. Strange dolls lie propped against the bases of the nearby trees with their arms clasped around the trunks in macabre hugs. The entire area whispers sibilant words that chill the very air, the source seemingly coming from the south.  A bone chilling cold seeps from the ground and leaves ghostly footprints along the pathway. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. With dark brown eyes, a slender wyvern with feathered wings prowls around here. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded. He wields a colossal brutish hammer in each hand. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D&#39;cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded. He wields a darkwood mandolin encased in iron filigree and bone in his left hand and the Discordant Rod of Chaos in his right. Bloodsworn Malicia La&#39;Saet, White Aegis is riding on Zyaran, the Midnight Eagle. She wields a steel inquisitor rapier in each hand. Bloodsworn Nydekion La&#39;Saet is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and the Golden Sceptre of Harmony in his right. Squire Veyrzhul Val&#39;Andra, Keeper of Zynna&#39;s Heart towers here, shrouded.

He wields a twisted staff in his left hand and a wyrm emblazoned shield in his right. Dartien is here, pondering thoughtfully. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand.

The loud, echoing caw of crows permeates the air, filling the area with a feeling of dread from a war shrine of Viravain nearby. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. Hanging suspended from the boughs overhead, beaten metal runes clang against one another in an eerie, discordant rhythm. Strange dolls lie propped against the bases of the nearby trees with their arms clasped around the trunks in macabre hugs. The entire area whispers sibilant words that chill the very air, the source seemingly coming from the south.  A bone chilling cold seeps from the ground and leaves ghostly footprints along the pathway. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded. He wields a colossal brutish hammer in each hand. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D&#39;cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded.

Saddened mist.
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. A thick unnatural fog glides around the edges of this room. Speaking madly, the fog itself seems to be the source of the inane gibbering that bounces about the area without pause. Bright red eyes peek out occasionally from the enshrouding mist but the rest of the creature is kept hidden. The trees themselves seem to droop, a palpable sadness seemingly encircling the entire area. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Supplicant Dartien is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D&#39;cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded. He wields a darkwood mandolin encased in iron filigree and bone in his left hand and the Discordant Rod of Chaos in his right. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded.

Twisting pathway into the wyrden mists.
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The trees here seem to cower in a subdued display almost hiding from the light that consistently shines from above. The boles of trees suddenly twist as if unseen gloom mires their visage in unbearable sorrow. The border thus created between the realm of Faethorn and this southern area is nearly immediate with no forewarning that the forested path is giving way into the darkness. An archway of thorns rises up from the ground. Settled within the branches of an ancient and skeletal tree roosts a murder of crows, their voices harsh and deafening as their caws peal through the air. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. Sipelus is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a golden amphora-crested steel shield in his right. Supplicant Dartien is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand. Proselyte Kalas Iytha, the Little Fae Gruul is here. She wields a twisted staff in her left hand and a bloody eyeball in her right. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded.

A bubble over oblivion.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. A yawning hole constantly sucks in the surrounding sand into its bottomless depths, creating a vacuum upon which rests an interesting bubble of epic proportions. The bubble happens to float within inches of the hole but doesn&#39;t come into contact with it. Keeping rigidly still, the entire balloon hangs there for no discernable reason other than to be there, although it does seem to prevent too much sand from dropping into oblivion. Several of the tents still find purchase on its top and hang there precariously. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground.

You look through an archway of thorns:
Among the twilight trees.
Thick, gossamer strands of spider webbing are strung through the air, clinging to the surfaces of trees and rock alike from a shield shrine of Viravain nearby. The blasted landscape screams of pain and suffering as the trees seem to crawl in unbearable agony. Their very bark is maimed into grotesque shapes that sickly imitate the flesh of dead bodies. Nearly all the trees are devoid of leaves and those that have some sort of foliage seem to whisper poisonous words into the very breath of the wind. Misty darkness shrouds the entire area in a false sense of twilight that is pierced only by strangely luminescent lichen that provides a subtle, malign glow to every surface. An archway of thorns rises up from the ground. A rowan sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. A jet black spider with a deadly stinger scuttles about here, clicking his mandibles together.
You see a single exit leading south.

Settled within the branches of an ancient and skeletal tree roosts a murder of crows, their voices harsh and deafening as their caws peal through the air. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Sipelus is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a golden amphora-crested steel shield in his right. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded. He wields a colossal brutish hammer in each hand. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D&#39;cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded.

Brassy trumpet blossoms.
Ephemeral visions of the virtue of Perseverance slip through your mind, small whispers of the power of the Hunt echoing in your ears and indicating a war shrine of Charune nearby. This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. Trumpeting bell flowers cover the entire landscape here with an effervescent burst of colours that fairly radiate with their own light. By some unknown means, the blossoms actually emit little whistles of brassy noise that reverberate around the entire glade. This delightful punctuation fits perfectly in with the breath of song that filters in from the north. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. Bloodsworn Malicia La&#39;Saet, White Aegis is riding on Zyaran, the Midnight Eagle.

Twisting pathway into the wyrden mists.
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The trees here seem to cower in a subdued display almost hiding from the light that consistently shines from above. The boles of trees suddenly twist as if unseen gloom mires their visage in unbearable sorrow. The border thus created between the realm of Faethorn and this southern area is nearly immediate with no forewarning that the forested path is giving way into the darkness. An archway of thorns rises up from the ground. Settled within the branches of an ancient and skeletal tree roosts a murder of crows, their voices harsh and deafening as their caws peal through the air. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground.

Misty darkness shrouds the entire area in a false sense of twilight that is pierced only by strangely luminescent lichen that provides a subtle, malign glow to every surface.

look
Runed pathway.
The loud, echoing caw of crows permeates the air, filling the area with a feeling of dread from a war shrine of Viravain nearby. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. Hanging suspended from the boughs overhead, beaten metal runes clang against one another in an eerie, discordant rhythm. Strange dolls lie propped against the bases of the nearby trees with their arms clasped around the trunks in macabre hugs. The entire area whispers sibilant words that chill the very air, the source seemingly coming from the south. A bone chilling cold seeps from the ground and leaves ghostly footprints along the pathway. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Supplicant Dartien is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand. Sipelus is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a golden amphora-crested steel shield in his right. Bloodsworn Malicia La'Saet, White Aegis is riding on Zyaran, the Midnight Eagle. She wields a steel inquisitor rapier in each hand. Squire Veyrzhul Val'Andra, Keeper of Zynna's Heart towers here, shrouded. He wields a cheekless klangaxe with both hands. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded. He wields a colossal brutish hammer in each hand. Attendant Esano, Scion of the Shattered Earth is here, shrouded. He wields a twisted staff in his left hand and a wyrm emblazoned shield in his right. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D'cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded.

Runed pathway.
The loud, echoing caw of crows permeates the air, filling the area with a feeling of dread from a war shrine of Viravain nearby. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. Hanging suspended from the boughs overhead, beaten metal runes clang against one another in an eerie, discordant rhythm. Strange dolls lie propped against the bases of the nearby trees with their arms clasped around the trunks in macabre hugs. The entire area whispers sibilant words that chill the very air, the source seemingly coming from the south. A bone chilling cold seeps from the ground and leaves ghostly footprints along the pathway. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D'cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded. He wields a darkwood mandolin encased in iron filigree and bone in his left hand and the Discordant Rod of Chaos in his right. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded. He wields a colossal brutish hammer in each hand. Sipelus is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a golden amphora-crested steel shield in his right. Squire Veyrzhul Val'Andra, Keeper of Zynna's Heart towers here, shrouded. He wields a cheekless klangaxe with both hands. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Dartien is here, pondering thoughtfully. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand. Bloodsworn Malicia La'Saet, White Aegis is riding on Zyaran, the Midnight Eagle. She wields a steel inquisitor rapier in each hand. Attendant Esano, Scion of the Shattered Earth is here, shrouded. He wields a twisted staff in his left hand and a wyrm emblazoned shield in his right.
You see exits leading north and southeast.

Hanging suspended from the boughs overhead, beaten metal runes clang against one another in an eerie, discordant rhythm. Strange dolls lie propped against the bases of the nearby trees with their arms clasped around the trunks in macabre hugs. The entire area whispers sibilant words that chill the very air, the source seemingly coming from the south. A bone chilling cold seeps from the ground and leaves ghostly footprints along the pathway. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded. He wields a colossal brutish hammer in each hand. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D'cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded.

Saddened mist.
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. A thick unnatural fog glides around the edges of this room. Speaking madly, the fog itself seems to be the source of the inane gibbering that bounces about the area without pause. Bright red eyes peek out occasionally from the enshrouding mist but the rest of the creature is kept hidden. The trees themselves seem to droop, a palpable sadness seemingly encircling the entire area. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Supplicant Dartien is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D'cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded. He wields a darkwood mandolin encased in iron filigree and bone in his left hand and the Discordant Rod of Chaos in his right. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded. He wields a colossal brutish hammer in each hand. Bloodsworn Malicia La'Saet, White Aegis is riding on Zyaran, the Midnight Eagle. She wields a steel inquisitor rapier in each hand. Sipelus is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a golden amphora-crested steel shield in his right. Attendant Esano, Scion of the Shattered Earth is here, shrouded.

look
Twisting pathway into the wyrden mists.
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The trees here seem to cower in a subdued display almost hiding from the light that consistently shines from above. The boles of trees suddenly twist as if unseen gloom mires their visage in unbearable sorrow. The border thus created between the realm of Faethorn and this southern area is nearly immediate with no forewarning that the forested path is giving way into the darkness. An archway of thorns rises up from the ground. Settled within the branches of an ancient and skeletal tree roosts a murder of crows, their voices harsh and deafening as their caws peal through the air. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. Sipelus is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a golden amphora-crested steel shield in his right. Supplicant Dartien is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand. Proselyte Kalas Iytha, the Little Fae Gruul is here. She wields a twisted staff in her left hand and a bloody eyeball in her right. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded.

A bubble over oblivion.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. A yawning hole constantly sucks in the surrounding sand into its bottomless depths, creating a vacuum upon which rests an interesting bubble of epic proportions. The bubble happens to float within inches of the hole but doesn't come into contact with it. Keeping rigidly still, the entire balloon hangs there for no discernable reason other than to be there, although it does seem to prevent too much sand from dropping into oblivion. Several of the tents still find purchase on its top and hang there precariously. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Supplicant Dartien is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand.

Among the twilight trees.
Thick, gossamer strands of spider webbing are strung through the air, clinging to the surfaces of trees and rock alike from a shield shrine of Viravain nearby. The blasted landscape screams of pain and suffering as the trees seem to crawl in unbearable agony. Their very bark is maimed into grotesque shapes that sickly imitate the flesh of dead bodies. Nearly all the trees are devoid of leaves and those that have some sort of foliage seem to whisper poisonous words into the very breath of the wind. Misty darkness shrouds the entire area in a false sense of twilight that is pierced only by strangely luminescent lichen that provides a subtle, malign glow to every surface. An archway of thorns rises up from the ground. A rowan sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. A jet black spider with a deadly stinger scuttles about here, clicking his mandibles together.
You see a single exit leading south.

Twisting pathway into the wyrden mists.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. An archway of thorns rises up from the ground. Settled within the branches of an ancient and skeletal tree roosts a murder of crows, their voices harsh and deafening as their caws peal through the air. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Sipelus is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a golden amphora-crested steel shield in his right. Deathguard Jozen Dawneye, the Bloody Epicene is here, shrouded. He wields a colossal brutish hammer in each hand. Elemental Supremacist, Narsrim D'cente`, Crescendo of Transformation is here, shrouded. He wields a darkwood mandolin encased in iron filigree and bone in his left hand and the Discordant Rod of Chaos in his right. Bloodsworn Malicia La'Saet, White Aegis is riding on Zyaran, the Midnight Eagle. She wields a steel inquisitor rapier in each hand. Supplicant Dartien is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand. Attendant Esano, Scion of the Shattered Earth is here, shrouded. He wields a twisted staff in his left hand and a wyrm emblazoned shield in his right.

Brassy trumpet blossoms.
Ephemeral visions of the virtue of Perseverance slip through your mind, small whispers of the power of the Hunt echoing in your ears and indicating a war shrine of Charune nearby. This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. Trumpeting bell flowers cover the entire landscape here with an effervescent burst of colours that fairly radiate with their own light. By some unknown means, the blossoms actually emit little whistles of brassy noise that reverberate around the entire glade. This delightful punctuation fits perfectly in with the breath of song that filters in from the north. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground. Bloodsworn Malicia La'Saet, White Aegis is riding on Zyaran, the Midnight Eagle. She wields a steel inquisitor rapier in each hand. Proselyte Kalas Iytha, the Little Fae Gruul is here. She wields a twisted staff in her left hand and a bloody eyeball in her right.

Twisting pathway into the wyrden mists.
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The trees here seem to cower in a subdued display almost hiding from the light that consistently shines from above. The boles of trees suddenly twist as if unseen gloom mires their visage in unbearable sorrow. The border thus created between the realm of Faethorn and this southern area is nearly immediate with no forewarning that the forested path is giving way into the darkness. An archway of thorns rises up from the ground. Settled within the branches of an ancient and skeletal tree roosts a murder of crows, their voices harsh and deafening as their caws peal through the air. A massive eagle perches here, silently preening its midnight-black plumage. Puffs of smoke emitting intermittently from her nostrils, a young nightmare paws at the ground.

look through archway
You look through an archway of thorns:
Among the twilight trees.
Thick, gossamer strands of spider webbing are strung through the air, clinging to the surfaces of trees and rock alike from a shield shrine of Viravain nearby. The blasted landscape screams of pain and suffering as the trees seem to crawl in unbearable agony. Their very bark is maimed into grotesque shapes that sickly imitate the flesh of dead bodies. Nearly all the trees are devoid of leaves and those that have some sort of foliage seem to whisper poisonous words into the very breath of the wind. Misty darkness shrouds the entire area in a false sense of twilight that is pierced only by strangely luminescent lichen that provides a subtle, malign glow to every surface. An archway of thorns rises up from the ground. Sniffing the air for a scent, Gwyllgi, the Dog of Darkness looms here.
You see a single exit leading south.
