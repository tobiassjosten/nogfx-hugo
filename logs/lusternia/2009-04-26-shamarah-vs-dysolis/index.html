A dried riverbed. (Skarch Desert.)
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Trickles of sand cascade down the embankment, the only movement this riverbed ever sees in this age. No doubt once a mighty current flowed through here but now naught remains but the slight current of air blowing past a tumbleweed. A dried up arroyo merges with the riverbed to the west. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Dysolis Heatherwood is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a glowing powerstone in his right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, south, southwest, and west.

A dried riverbed. (Skarch Desert.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Trickles of sand cascade down the embankment, the only movement this riverbed ever sees in this age. No doubt once a mighty current flowed through here but now naught remains but the slight current of air blowing past a tumbleweed. A dried up arroyo merges with the riverbed to the west. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. A sand cobra flares its hood here. Dysolis Heatherwood is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand and a glowing powerstone in his right.
