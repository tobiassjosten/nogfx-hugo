Guards eyeing the tents. (lost) (Faethorn Realm.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky. Ethereal eyeballs float about, careful watchers that eye everyone and everything that passes this way. Encircling the tents within their centre, the guardians take careful notice of anything unfamiliar and blink rapidly to clear the dust and sand flying about everywhere. Thin, short leashes keep them away from the communal path although they cluster eagerly at the utmost ends of their chains to examine those that walk nearby. An oak sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. Supreme Commander Kalas Ixion, Planeswalker is here, shrouded. He wields an unadorned darksteel rapier in each hand.

Ethereal eyeballs float about, careful watchers that eye everyone and everything that passes this way.

Thin, short leashes keep them away from the communal path although they cluster eagerly at the utmost ends of their chains to examine those that walk nearby. An oak sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. Supreme Commander Kalas Ixion, Planeswalker is here, shrouded. He wields an unadorned darksteel rapier in each hand.

A swirling void of darkness opens up before Ixion, emanating a mad alien presence. He whimpers as tendrils of icy smoke leap out and bore into his body. As the void slams shut, he screams in abject terror, and you cannot help but watch in fascination as his soul is ripped asunder from his body.
The ominous silence lifts as your concentration is broken.
You have slain Ixion.
Your karma falls in response to your deeds.
Ixion drops a stalk of faeleaf.
