Seres River leaving the mountains. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The swift-moving water of the Seres flows quietly to the southeast, branches and other debris floating along as the river leaves the mountains. Ahead lies a stretch of wasteland, bleak and desolate. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.

A field of rocks. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The ground here is littered with small rocks, some razor sharp, poking up all around. The air is hot and dry, and the loose dirt that blows around on the ground is direct evidence of the complete lack of plants and water in the area. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here.
You see exits leading east and south.

A field of rocks. (lost) (Blasted Land.?)
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The ground here is littered with small rocks, some razor sharp, poking up all around. The air is hot and dry, and the loose dirt that blows around on the ground is direct evidence of the complete lack of plants and water in the area. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.

Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.

Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.

Barren field on the bank of the Seres. (lost) (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The parched fields stretch on here, a faint path winding around to the north and the southeast. The Seres river can be heard nearby, failing to give life to the harsh wasteland. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and southwest.

Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky.

The air is hot and dry, and the loose dirt that blows around on the ground is direct evidence of the complete lack of plants and water in the area. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.

A field of rocks. (lost) (Blasted Land.?)
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The ground here is littered with small rocks, some razor sharp, poking up all around. The air is hot and dry, and the loose dirt that blows around on the ground is direct evidence of the complete lack of plants and water in the area. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.
You see exits leading east and south.
