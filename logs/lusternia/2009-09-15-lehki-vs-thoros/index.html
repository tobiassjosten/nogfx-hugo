A vine drops down from a tree limb and lashes out at Thoros, cutting him deeply with its tiny thorns.
The tiny red mushrooms on the ground release a cloud of yellow spores, which travel up Thoros's nose and make his eyes water.
Small motes of yellow pollen rise up from the wildflowers and drift into Thoros's mouth. He flushes and begins to cough.
Squirrels chitter madly but remain unseen in the trees. Thoros is pelted by acorns that leave welts and bruises.

He wields Hatred in his left hand and Greed in his right.

The spectator stands of the Klangratch Tournies.
The shadowy outline of a twisted forest casts a dark gloom here. Beloch Baruwski swaggers about here, gripping an enormous stein and singing bawdy songs. Smoke curling from her nostrils, a dark grey nightmare paws impatiently at the grey clouds that roil beneath her hooves. Ur'Lord Thoros d'Murani, Scythe of The Red Masque is here, shrouded. He wields Hatred in his left hand and Greed in his right.
You see exits leading in and out.
