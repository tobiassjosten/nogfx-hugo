Burrows within the woods.
The shadows have been gathered here. There is a maelstrom of rainbow colours whipping violently around. The ground rises abruptly into a small chain of hills and bluffs. The trees grow thin and sparse on the slopes, preventing any further passage north. Just past the inner row of hills, many small holes and burrows dot the landscape. Leprechauns dart in and out of the burrows, clutching small, shiny treasures next to their chests. A trail of animal prints leads back south to the watering hole.
You see a single exit leading south.

Burrows within the woods.
The shadows have been gathered here. There is a maelstrom of rainbow colours whipping violently around. The ground rises abruptly into a small chain of hills and bluffs. The trees grow thin and sparse on the slopes, preventing any further passage north. Just past the inner row of hills, many small holes and burrows dot the landscape. Leprechauns dart in and out of the burrows, clutching small, shiny treasures next to their chests. A trail of animal prints leads back south to the watering hole.
You see a single exit leading south.
