Entrance to the northern spire.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. A faint acrid smell lingers in the cavernous atrium of this coral spire and faint wisps of mist seem to seep from the surrounding walls. The coral walls of the atrium are cracked in several places which serve as footholds for an unrecognizable species of creeper vine to infest the once-magnificent entranceway. The vine itself appears to be the source of the acrid smell, as the leaves are browned and aged, though it appears to be healthy and thriving in this environment. Several objects lie hidden under the thick mass of vines which create a difficult path to navigate to reach the base of a curved metal staircase that twists up the side of the atrium. The vines carpet the floor until reaching the curved archway to the south. There, the vines abruptly stop, as if some invisible force holds the fiendish growth at bay. Holy light emanates from the ground here, filling the air with the Glory of Celestia. Geb Kamau is here, shrouded. He wields a warrior's iron greatsword with both hands.
You see exits leading southeast, southwest, and up.

Holding a warrior's iron greatsword poised at an angle overhead, Geb unleashes a violent assault at your right leg. Geb strikes the tendon above your right heel, and you scream in agony as it's completely severed.
The blade shears through your body before coming clean through the other side with a strangely quiet swish, momentarily surprising you with its force, before you feel distinctly unwell and collapse to the ground.
You have been slain by Geb.

Entrance to the northern spire.
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. A faint acrid smell lingers in the cavernous atrium of this coral spire and faint wisps of mist seem to seep from the surrounding walls. The coral walls of the atrium are cracked in several places which serve as footholds for an unrecognizable species of creeper vine to infest the once-magnificent entranceway. The vine itself appears to be the source of the acrid smell, as the leaves are browned and aged, though it appears to be healthy and thriving in this environment. Several objects lie hidden under the thick mass of vines which create a difficult path to navigate to reach the base of a curved metal staircase that twists up the side of the atrium. The vines carpet the floor until reaching the curved archway to the south. There, the vines abruptly stop, as if some invisible force holds the fiendish growth at bay. Holy light emanates from the ground here, filling the air with the Glory of Celestia. Geb Kamau is here, shrouded. He wields a warrior's iron greatsword with both hands.
You see exits leading southeast, southwest, and up.

Holding a warrior's iron greatsword poised at an angle overhead, Geb unleashes a violent assault at your right leg. Geb strikes the tendon above your right heel, and you scream in agony as it's completely severed.
The blade shears through your body before coming clean through the other side with a strangely quiet swish, momentarily surprising you with its force, before you feel distinctly unwell and collapse to the ground.
You have been slain by Geb.
You become visible once more.
