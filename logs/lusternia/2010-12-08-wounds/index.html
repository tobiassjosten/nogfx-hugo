Source of the Seres.
The shadows have been gathered here. A barren island of tainted land floats here. Small flakes of 
white float through your field of vision here and there. A large fountain of water shoots up from 
the dry earth around it, pooling out and forming into the Seres River that flows off to the east. 
The area is surrounded by trees that are watered by the large river. A black phoenix perches here, 
her fiery plumage illuminating the area with black fire. Ur'Warlord Vathael d'Vanecu, the Benevolent 
lingers here, surrounded by a bloody, cloying haze. He wields a twisted staff in his left hand and a 
dark shield bearing a crimson mask in his right.
You see exits leading east and south.

A violent tremor rocks the land, causing the earth to shake and the ground to buck beneath your feet.
Dust suddenly and painfully gusts into your eyes.
A deep, foreboding hum emanates from the tainted earth, and then you are suddenly slammed into the 
ground by an irresistable force.
Dust clouds rise as the earth shifts and sharp rocks slide and bounce, some flying into the air. You 
yelp in pain as several of them smash into you, bruising your flesh and cutting your skin.
A magic aura flares around you and completely absorbs the damage.
Fumes rise up from the tainted earth and make you cough. Ugly cankerous sores break out on your skin,
 dripping with pus.

A violent tremor rocks the land, causing the earth to shake and the ground to buck beneath your feet.
Dust suddenly and painfully gusts into your eyes.
A deep, foreboding hum emanates from the tainted earth, and then you are suddenly slammed into the
ground by an irresistable force.
Dust clouds rise as the earth shifts and sharp rocks slide and bounce, some flying into the air. You
yelp in pain as several of them smash into you, bruising your flesh and cutting your skin.

Entering: Avechna's Peak
!o!o!o! VATHAEL has left the area !o!o!o!
The spectator stands of the Klangratch Tournies.
Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky. A painting of Sior is
proudly exhibited on a nearby wall. A black phoenix perches here, her fiery plumage illuminating the
area with black fire. Supreme Commander Kalas Ixion, of the Black Fist stands here amidst a cloud of
deathly cold mist. He wields an unadorned darksteel rapier in each hand. Ur'Warlord Vathael d'Vanecu,
the Benevolent lingers here, surrounded by a bloody, cloying haze. He wields a twisted staff in his
left hand and a dark shield bearing a crimson mask in his right.
You see exits leading in and out.
