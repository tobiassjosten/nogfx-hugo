So he&#39;s stirring up whatever he desires on his way out, causing a great deal of lulz.

Sorry in advance - the removal of my prompt is really inconsistent. I can&#39;t be arsed to go through ALL THAT.

A few days after this, Kalikai is acting IC and muttering about divine retribution if Gaudiguch forces her two Order Heads out of the city as a result of all the drama. To clarify - this is a goddess being attached to her followers, and expressing this in private to them over Order channels.

I&#39;ve always been skeptical about Kalikai&#39;s effectiveness as an administrator - she operates largely behind-the-scenes and rarely talks to anyone outside of her own order. Even then, only her order heads have the slightest inkling of what she&#39;s up to. While she&#39;s lazy, she&#39;s definitely inscrutible and is playing the &#39;unreadable tactician&#39; role to the T.

More CT crap, spanning a day or two:


(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "She denied me access to the Eternal Flame to 
continue my work keeping the peace and patrolling the Plane of Fire."

(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "I blocked his power for his 
debt and he felt it enough justification to slaughter me in cold blood I even 
sat down did not raise a hand to him."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "You rose no hand to me because you have no will to 
do anything besides be a sycophant, wench."

(Gaudiguch): Hintaro says, "Wow, murder is justice?"
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "He is the Hand, a guild Champion. It is his duty 
to use power to protect the Fire plane."
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-

(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "No I actually will not harm a 
city mate even though he&#39;s being thoroughly ridiculous."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "From what? More fire mantises?"
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "The One Law is as follows, "The Law is Love; Love 
under Will". If it becomes nessecary, in order to maintain Love under Will, 
than it can be justified to perform certain actions, including killing people. 
It&#39;s up to the Freedom Council to decide what is needed."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "No, from would be attacker, Ayden. I was the 
Hand once, I know the responsibilities."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Others were ousted for the same offence."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He thinks he&#39;s above the law."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He is horribly wrong."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "And i was the Supreme Paragon."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Touch her again and I will kill you myself."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Touch any citizen and i will see your death down to 
novicehood."

(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "There were no attackers, and 
he had plenty of power it&#39;s a simple thing to repay his debt... Veracruz was 
blocked yet he did NOT go on a killing spree."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "So, you&#39;d break the law to punish him for the 
same? How...smart..."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Interestingly enough yes. That would put you in the 
exact same position as Rodngar."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He should be ousted and wouldnt be a citizen if the 
law applied to him."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Like it does everyone else."

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Again, it is within the One Law to execute people for 
going against the One Law."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "I say let Rodngar throw his little tantrum, it will 
only show his character."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "So long as no Mayor reigns, no law reigns as well."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Actually it&#39;s called definding the citizens."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "So not the same."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "Well, then let&#39;s just oust everyone that&#39;s ever 
infringed on another persons Will. Oh, wait, we do that and we won&#39;t have ANY 
citizens left!"

(Gaudiguch): Hintaro says, "Rubish, the law should always remain."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "There is still a council."

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "The Freedom Council can order people executed, if it 
is truly for the best, and most of them are in agreement."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Who isn&#39;t getting consulted until things are already 
way out of hand."

(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "Did the council order briaria executed?"

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No."

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "No."

(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "Then what difference does that make?"

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "The Freedom Council doesn&#39;t have to do that, and, 
indeed, probably shouldn&#39;t in most cases. But it&#39;s an option if it ever needs 
to happen."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "I dont feel you killing my friends considered "fun" 
rodgnar."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "It seems a certain citymate believes it&#39;s okay to 
kill citizens and get by with it."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "This month I had a discussion with the Lady."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "A long one."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "For about five minutes of the next day, you should 
seriously step back from thinking about any -one person-, and think about what 
exactly it is that&#39;s ripped Gaudiguch in half since the day it existed again."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Want to talk about it again later? Fine with me."

(): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "In before "RODNGAR"."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "But take that moment, and seriously ponder on it."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Because whether you oust Rodngar, myself, Aleria, 
Relk, whoever."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "The problem will still exist."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Correction."

>> Here we go!

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "We wont have citizens killing citizens."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Apparently my sentence on not being narrow minded 
missed you."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "It&#39;s larger than that."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "I would say it started with the drinking and the 
weed. And corruption months/all the injustices associated with it."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Much, much larger."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "This city has been divided since the start."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "There is nothing narrow minded about allowing 
injustices."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Indeed, Lyria."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "And it continues to be divided."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I will kill no citizens so 
long as they do not interfere in my affairs, Aleria. Briaria interfered with my 
business and paid the price."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Aleria, hush and think as 
the Archmage has advised."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "And no matter who did what to who, who you get rid of 
because you hate them and wow they&#39;re so cruel."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "It will continue to be divided."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Was not Veracruz kicked out for killing a citymate? 
Why is this any different with Rodngar?"

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "You cannot kill who you wish and you will pay for 
that."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Until somehow everyone can manage to think of the 
bigger picture."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "What was your vote back then, Lyria? With Veracruz?"

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Everyone but Lyria, shut 
it."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Balian. I&#39;m not talking about Rodngar. Or anything 
that happened this month."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Or last month."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "So sit high and mighty because very soon you will 
reep what you sow."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I&#39;m talking about everything as a whole."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor (from the Aetherways) says, "You will kill no citizens 
rodgnar because it&#39;s against th law."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "And no Aleria. Sadly, you will."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Whether I&#39;m here, or I&#39;m gone, trust me."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "Arandor, the law is merely a 
suggestion."

(Gaudiguch): Aletta says, "Can&#39;t we just stop thinking about ourselves for 
once? We have the potential to be the GREATEST city in the Basin but all we do is think about ourselves. If we thought about the city as a whole just every once in awhile we&#39;d be so much better than we are now."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Like I said, the problem will still exist because 
nobody in this city can think beyond "Right now.""

(Gaudiguch): Aletta says, "I think that&#39;s what the Archmage and the Lady are 
trying toget at."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "If we weren&#39;t a group of 
power hungry fools, this city WOULD be great, Aletta."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Oh i will? Some of us actually protect the law you 
and Kalin created yet now you do nothing when action needs made."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor (from the Aetherways) says, "Your actions have 
consiquences... Briaria was killed for powerblocking you when it is her job to 
do so as one of the city power aides."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Krin was also kicked for killing a citizen."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Is it possible that you can switch to a different 
subject, or are you intent on being stuck to it for the rest of the month?"

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Funnily it didnt take a second though eh?"

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "Krin was kicked for much more 
than &#39;killing a citizen&#39;."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I was pretty sure I was talking about a bigger 
picture, and asked the other topics to be put on hold for five minutes."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "She is not the Power 
Minister and was over-ridden by a Council member. That should have told her to 
stop blocking him."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "But then again, perhaps I misheard myself."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "No, you did Archmage. 
These people don&#39;t listen, as usual."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "You&#39;re avoiding this one though. And the power is 
your hands Lyria, to make a step in the right direction, if you believed in the 
laws you created, and what you previously upheld, for different individuals."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "At this moment, I am yes."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "She is worried about the 
state of our city and how it has been divided from the start due to power 
hungry individuals that cannot be satisfied."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "And such it will remain."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "So Alexandera, look at who has been in power since 
our city was started."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Yes and as alot of us agree that he should be 
ousted."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "I&#39;m well aware. I helped 
keep Kalin in power for years."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "I think that might fix someone of the bickering no?"

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Here, I have a good, salient point about why 
Gaudiguch is failing! Let&#39;s talk about that."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I&#39;m sincerely astounded at how much you&#39;ve missed my 
point."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "May i speak, Lyria?"

excuse to shy away from the law."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Or that it&#39;s a whole separate issue. Wow. And yes, 
Ayden, of course."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And not an excuse to not act."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No it is not."

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Gaudiguch is failing because people here have an 
unrealistic expectation about the nature of Freedom."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Please listen."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Thank you Iytha."

(Gaudiguch): Penelope says, "I am the Minister of Power. I am telling you to 
stop blocking him. I WILL NOT watch anyone die over this other than myself."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly when the powerminister doesnt wish for 
someone to break the law."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And allows someone to over draw because of it."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Thank you, Penelope."

Caerulo gives a pained sigh.

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And now he controls the power from the flame, 
because of fear. You shouldn&#39;t have to fear the death of another citizen, 
Penelope. And certainly not your own."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "What position has that caused in our city?"

(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "What is with the childishness of this city? One 
powerblock over something initially stupid has very severe backlashes on a 
whole city?"

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "What position was the city in before this Aleria?"

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Wow, much the same."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "The people change. The situation does not."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Because the same people had been in power. Until 
recently."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No it wasnt...people got punished for it."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Archmage Lyria, you definitely have a point. I have 
noticed the division since I joined Gaudiguch and it&#39;s a problem that needs to 
be dealth with. But currently, there is problem that needs to be dealt with 
now. Which is why so many of the citizenry is up in arms. I believe when the 
current problem is settled that we can deal with the Division that we&#39;ve had."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Perhaps we can."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "I agree with Ayden."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly."

(Gaudiguch): Leesa says, "I think I picked the wrong city. Rodngar, if you 
killed a power person for blocking your power because you were in debt, you are 
a sad sad little man who should pay his debts. Any citizen who would defend you 
under the definition of freedom is stupid."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Thank you."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Well said Leesa."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Lyria, I ask that you vote to uncitizen Rodngar for 
his blatant disrespect of Council members and taking the One Law into his own 
hands as well as threatening the Minister of Power."

(Gaudiguch): Leesa says, "I picked this city for a reason."

(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "No."

(Gaudiguch): Leesa says, "Freedom."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "This is not about power debt."

(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "Its about murder, thats what its about."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "He is the Champion, Leesa. 
It&#39;s part of his job to draw power. And she denied him part of his job, 
repeatedly, even after being over-ridden by a Council member. Think on that for 
a moment. A measly little power aide thought they had more authority than a 
Council member."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No it&#39;s about you murderering someone for your own 
justification."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I murdered her after warning 
her."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "You killed a citizen. That has gotten many before 
you kicked out of the city. Why is this different now?"

(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "Murder is murder."

backed."

makes it okay."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Ok."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Well."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And I think before him was... did someone say Krin?"

(Gaudiguch): Leesa says, "I heard someone say that there was no security threat 
that needed power. That&#39;s one of the first things that got me thinking about 
all this bickering."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Relk, do not treat me as I 
know nothing of this city. I have been here longer than you and been part of 
holding it together numerous times."

(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "Veracruz, one person that has a temper. So what."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Meaning?"

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Ofcourse...so did munsia and that person wasnt a 
citizen."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Imagine that."

(Gaudiguch): Relk (from the Aetherways) says, "I am only speaking the truth 
Alexandera."

(Gaudiguch): Alaina (from the Aetherways) says, "I can&#39;t hear myself think 
either, Leesa."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Interesting how Lyria is not answering, when Ayden&#39;s 
address was to her specifically."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Aside from all the drama and hate and anger, we&#39;ve 
been pretty decent as a city since my time here but i have to say... its good 
to see so many citizens awake at the same time."

(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "What is one murder, a little bit of expierence to 
blocking a Champion from power. Expierience can be regained."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "You are speaking your 
version of it. Just as I am giving my opinion."

(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "A measily little power aide 
so citizens are less worthy to live Alexandera no I think not. He was told if 
he paid it back he&#39;d be unblocked but he resorted to threats and unjustified 
murder. But I suppose that&#39;s fine and good.. he had power he didn&#39;t need to be 
unblocked Veracruz was champion but he was blocked your arguements are moot."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Now lets please stop the drama and violence and 
stuff."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Briaria, I have been a 
power aide far longer than you. Do not speak to me in that manner again."

(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "Alexandera I speak as I 
please and you nor anyone else commands me."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "How about since this is okay....you all decide he 
shouldnt be punished right now."

(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "Pray you remember that in the 
future."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Then again, perhaps Lyria is not answering because 
of the noise. But I have my doubts."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Why dont we just start citizening munsia 
back..veracruz...krin."

>> Hold this.

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And everyone and just have right o party of it."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "Aleria, I never once told you 
that you may not punish me, but right now, you are incapable of doing so."

(Gaudiguch): Aletta says, "Hey guys? Hey-- it&#39;s a beautiful morning."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Go ahead, they would 
actually improve the state of this city right now Aleria."

(Gaudiguch): Akui says, "Hmmm, yes. Keep arguing, all of you. I demand it of 
you."

(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "You think theyd come back?"


(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "In several months, you can do 
what you wish."

(Gaudiguch): Aletta says, "I bet if we all just calm down we can get a lot 
accomplished."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Oh yeah they would."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And in the meantime Rod? You will kill who you wish?"

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Alright, folks. I&#39;m making a speech. Get over to the 
Flame."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Ok..."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "You&#39;re going to do what you want to do irregardless 
Aleria."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And Lyria will stand for it, and defend it."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Ofcourse he will..lyria backs him."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "So I&#39;d imagine that&#39;s your decision."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Honour you for it, in fact, if she hadn&#39;t already."

(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "I&#39;ll stand for it."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Lyria is tired of things."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "More than just Lyria backs 
him."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And allows citizens to die ...she didnt last month."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "If that&#39;s not injustice and what&#39;s tearing the city 
apart.. I don&#39;t know what is."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "For discrspect to council members."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I will kill nobody who does 
not lay hands on me first, how about that, Balian?"

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Briaria declared you?"

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "You&#39;re utterly right. One situation in which I don&#39;t 
vote Rodngar out has been the underlying cause of the city being divided for 
decades, Balian."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Shame, shame on me."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "How about we all start acting like grown ups 
instead of children for once. That&#39;d be a change."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "No, but it&#39;s the current problem."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CARE, YOU&#39;RE ONLY MAKING 
THINGS WORSE AND MAKING US ALL LOOK LIKE FOOLS. ON A DIFFERENT NOTE, IF ANYONE 
NEEDS ASSISTANCE PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I&#39;LL DO MY BEST TO HELP YOU ALL."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Thank you."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Not the indecision. The continuation of the 
injustice. And your belittling of it."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "All this time, my little faeling self was the cause."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "You who is supposed to uphold the LAW."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "But not for friends.. NO, definetely not for 
friends!"

(Gaudiguch): Nirrain says, "It may not be the cause. However, it will only 
cause a bigger divide."

(Gaudiguch): Sivali says, "Hah, I&#39;m just going to say it, go ahead and scream 
insanity at me or whatever. It&#39;s a fucking game. Grow up. Have fun. Stop making 
all sorts of god damn DRAMA. I swear, every single thing IRE puts out is the 
same damn thing. Go ahead, shun me for breaking character, you all are guilty 
of it as well, acting like damned children the last few days. Anywho, I know 
I&#39;m not much for this city, just a little undersecretary in the Pyromancers, 
but whatever. There, it&#39;s been said, and I&#39;m gone. Later kids. <3."

>> Yeah, Sivali is actually from Achaea. Ashtan in particular.

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "No, Balian, but Briaria 
stated her aggression through blocking me and overriding a command of a Council 
member."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but most of this city has 
balked at the mere thought of a law from the get go."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "The divide will grow regardless."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Now everyone wants to swear by it? Goodness."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Do it&#39;s clear. She DIDN&#39;T lay hands on you."

(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "I was NEVER commanded by any 
council member to not do my duty."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "It&#39;s been in place for years, Lyria. What&#39;s your 
point?"

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "We&#39;ve upheld it before, haven&#39;t we?"

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "My point right now is that you&#39;ve missed my point."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "YOU&#39;ve upheld it before. Why not now? When it&#39;s your 
friend on the line?"

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "Briaria, read the logs. Lyria, a Council member, 
reversed your blocking him. That should have been enough."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "You cant justify protecting him."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No matter how you try."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "No. Ayden made the point that You&#39;ve missed."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I didn&#39;t justify it."

(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "I wonder what Kalikai would think of her city now? A 
pitiful city divided over a power block, a murder justified, and trying to 
regain law in a city that does not follow laws."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And you refused to address it, because you have no 
answer."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Matter of fact, Rodngar, did I not tell you your 
actions weren&#39;t the proper ones?"

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Then uphold the law as it always has been."

(Gaudiguch): Seneth says, "Perhaps we can all calm down a moment?"

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Uhh.. you honored him for standing up for what he 
believes in."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And remove the one that has killed our citizens."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I&#39;ve stated, oh this will be the ninth time here."

(Gaudiguch): Valtorin says, "The point is, Lyria is a prime example of what is 
wrong with the city, twist the law to suite them, and then ignore it when it 
doesn&#39;t, that is the point."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Or did my eyes deceive me?"

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "That was before he killed anyone, Balian."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Neither side was completely in the right."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "You did, but as a free 
individual, I am entitled to my own action."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Oh I did Balian. He hadn&#39;t killed anyone yet."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "And you must pay for them, Rodngar."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Right. It was only for disrespecting TWO council 
members."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And you are entitled to be punished for it to."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I will pay for them when you 
can remove me rightfully."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I was unaware you were in my head!"

(Gaudiguch): Relk (from the Aetherways) says, "Rodngar you are not acting like 
a free individual. You are acting like an anarchist."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "The couch to your left is rather comfortable."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "The only reason you arent removed."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Mhm.. If I was in the Pyromancers and was -enemying- 
Rod, would you honour me Lyria, for standing up for what I believe in?"

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Is because lyria protects you."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And no one is blind to it."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "I don&#39;t think so. You could disfavour at the 
-least-."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "Indeed, Aleria - do you see 
me denying that though?"

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "No one is blind to anyone else either. Which has 
again, been my point for the past half day."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "He has had two disfavours. That is plenty."

(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I have had two disfavours and 
a headache for each to boot."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Your point is a scapegoat Lyria."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Thank you, Balian."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He deserves what everyone else got."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "For the same crime."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And ousting."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He&#39;s not beyond that."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Lyria says he is."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Two disfavours is hardly punishment enough."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "With her actions. Or lack thereof."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I do enjoy words getting put in my mouth."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Ocourse he is while the laws are corrupted to suit 
means."

(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Please calm down everybody."

(Gaudiguch): Valtorin says, "My only hope is that when this election is over, 
is that both Rodngar and Lyria are promptly removed and enemied for the crimes 
they have committed against the city."

(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "You know thats not going to work at all, right 
ayden?"

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "That was their original plan to begin with, Valtorin."

(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Or if they have the decency, to remove themselves."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Actually there wasnt one."

(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "You want to oust the Archmage? How interesting."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Okay."

(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "Bah."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "I am not one to remove people unjustly."

(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "City of Complaints."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "However rodngar has broken a law that goes beyond 
disagreements."

(Gaudiguch): Akui says, "All tyrants respect freedom. They merely wish your 
freedom to be their own so that they may more perfectly respect it. By the same 
token, the anarchist hates all law... save those that grant them what they 
want."

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Righto. I&#39;ve been asked to repeat my long-arsed 
speech at the Flame. Enjoy."


(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Without understanding the true nature of Freedom, 
freedom is but a word. Let us contemplate the nature of Freedom: Freedom is not 
a simple thing to have. Freedom is, of course, not found by saying "Everything 
is forbidden, nothing is permitted." That is obvious. Less obvious is the fact 
that it is equally impossible to maximize freedom by simply declaring a maxim 
of "Nothing is forbidden, everything is permitted" and letting people do what 
they like to who they like. Such a society will always fail, just as much as 
the former. Thus, we must accept that for each "freedom to", there also exists 
a "freedom from" which we must also weight. We must choose, for each possible 
deed, if we wish to be free from it being done, or if we will be free do it."

understand a word of that speech?"

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "You want a city that actually abides by it&#39;s laws."

To  : Everyone
Subj: This whole mess

Everyone,

I want to say a few things about this whole... mess. First off, Lyria, I
do not wish to see you ousted or leave the city. I think you have done a
rather well job being Senator. Secondly, Rodngar, you commited murder,
which is wrong no matter what. There is a difference in self defence and
outright cold blooded murder and you need to accept the fact that you
are not above the laws to which each and everyone one of us have to
abide by. Thirdly, splitting this city apart as we are doing now has
created nothing but chaos anarchy and made complete jokes out of
ourselves and the great city of Gaudiguch. I ask you all to very kindly
shut up, stop bickering amongst ourselves and get order back in the
reigns. This has done nothing but tear this city down when there were
already holes in the stitching. Not myself nor any single one person can
make those mends. It will take ALL of us to build this back up. There is
no point in this. It was a simple contestion and WE ALL let it get to
this point whether you have said words or not. Everyone is at fault here
and if you want to blame and point fingers take a look in a mirror and
point there. Cast that blame there. I say we stop fighting. I say we
stop dividing ourselves. Stop letting this crap take down our glorious
city. That&#39;s all I have to say, take whatever has been said in the past
roll it up in a tiny little piss ball and throw it in the trash. Because
until you do that nothing will be solved and at some point something
terrible will happen.

So I leave you all with one parting thought to contemplate. Is all this
really worth the fall of Gaudiguch?

Forever in service,
Relk Ama&#39;rua

Subj: Elections and Enlightenment

Citizens! I have a very important announcement to make!

Yesterday, a few chaps and I decided to seek Enlightenment. So we
grabbed the nearest hookah and had a truly beatific session. After a few
hours of smoking and contemplation of the insightful visions, we came to
a very important conclusion. Important enough that I wanted to share it
with all of you:

Let me tell you of the venerable reveller who attempted to punish his
parents. This reveller traveled to New Celest. Unthinkingly, the
reveller sought the cold-hearted lucidian and wept.

Unfortunately, we had to keep the hookah lit and ran out of cinder
sometime during the night. We used those little papers lying around
everywhere instead. It was only today that I realized those were the
voting papers.

So! My other message to you is that those with ambitions have to contest
again and the rest will have to recast their votes. But considering the
important piece of enlightenment I could share with you, this is a small
price to pay right?


Sincerely,

And suddenly, the election has been reset entirely. Why did this happen?

Subj: Seconds and Multiplaying

We are serous about holding seconds to a much higher standard of
roleplay when it comes to making sure there is no hint of overlap
between the two characters. Thus, the file for HELP SECONDS has been
updated with the following paragraph:

"IT IS HIGHLY ADVISED THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TWO ACTIVE SECONDS IN THE
SAME CITY OR COMMUNE. The temptation is too great to blur the RP lines
between seconds in the same organization, as it becomes too easy to
enter into the same families or join the same clans, even voting in
lockstep with each other, etc. The bottom line is that seconds must be
kept completely separate from each other."

Hmm!

Well, Sivali is leaving with the Kalin crowd. Dunno what was up with Nidra, but she was one of Gaudiguch&#39;s shop owners and had vacated it a few moments prior.

Let&#39;s see the rest:



Siniaba (Male Dracnari).
He is 28 years old, having been born on the 6th of Urlachmar, 252 years after the Coming of Estarra.
He is unranked in Lusternia.
He is an extremely credible character.
He is a Pedestrian in the Fellowship of Explorers.
He is a graduate of the Order of the Secret Flame.
He is considered to be approximately 5% of your might.
He is not currently active in any family.


Rireayi (Male Dracnari).
He is 26 years old, having been born on the 5th of Tzarin, 254 years after the Coming of Estarra.
He is unranked in Lusternia.
He is an extremely credible character.
He is a Vagrant in the Fellowship of Explorers.
He is surrounded by the Grace of Innocence.
He is considered to be approximately 0% of your might.
He is not currently active in any family.


Valis (Female Faeling).
She is 20 years old, having been born on the 6th of Kiani, 260 years after the Coming of Estarra.
She is ranked 522nd in Lusternia.
She is an extremely credible character.
She is a Valleyrunner in the Fellowship of Explorers.
She is a graduate of the Order of the Secret Flame (honours).
Her motto: &#39;The shoe is on the hand it fits.&#39;
She is considered to be approximately 35% of your might.
She is not currently active in any family.
See HONOURS FULL VALIS to view her 5 special honours.


Dristan (Male Loboshigaru).

He is ranked 973rd in Lusternia.
He is an extremely credible character.

Alaya (Female Loboshigaru).

She is ranked 950th in Lusternia.
She is an extremely credible character.

A strange, motley crew of individuals. Valis even had all 5 lines for the Gaudiguch Epic Quest. Why the sudden rush to leave? Nothing implicating on any of their honors, save for one person being part of the Pirates of the Hearth clan, where Aleria/Relk like congregating their aetherhunting brood.

Our first reflex after admin intervention or the resolution of an issue is to check and see if anyone gets shrubbed. In every challenge against Kalin, some random alt makes a post on the Gaudiguch news board and either suicides or gets shrubbed.

None of the main players here are shrubbed. Nobody on FAMILY TREE AMA&#39;RUA, none of the contesters, not Aleria or Relk themselves. The sad thing is? With every novice in Gaudiguch being drafted into the Ama&#39;rua within 5 minutes, we would be hard pressed to actually remember possible names for shrubbing. They could have simply been deleted, too.

Oh lawdy.

To cap off this issue of Gaudiguch Drama (which is really full of nonsensical crap on CT):

Dysolis is working with the Ama&#39;rua to take over Gaudiguch.
Finally, after all his incoherent forum rage, he THINKS he is going to win.
He&#39;s "been dracnari longer than all you shitheads" ergo he is qualified for mayor.
I&#39;ve suspected this was the case for a long time:

- If you look back in the logs from earlier, you see: 2010/11/05 01:46:15 - Siniaba quit the city.
- In my time as Illuminati GM, I was approached by Siniaba and asked to join the Illuminati. They were coming from the Pyromancers. I asked - why? As I do with everyone. Why do you want to join my guild? What is your driving RP reason? Why do you want to join the most ancient organization in the Basin? No, Siniaba, "I want to be a guardian" doesn&#39;t work, because then you can just go join the Nihilists if you want it that badly. It is not hard to pull an excuse out of your bum. I like to think critical thinking is not impossible for anyone.
- Unfortunately, Siniaba took this question ("Why?") to be my doubting his patriotism as a Gaudiguchian citizen (and other Dysolis-esque pissiness was given in response). Siniaba QQ&#39;s as I hit my &#39;reply Alright, come to me so I can induct you.&#39; command. Twenty minutes later, Seneth appears in the Illuminati, learning on his own. Three hours later, pipes, vials, robes and herbs. Three days later, tri trans skills.
- I suspected at this point that Dysolis = Seneth and that he&#39;d eventually contest for a spot in the Illuminati. He didn&#39;t, though - he rode it out, joined the Ama&#39;rua and was immediately set up to be their pawn for Mayor. I started having my doubts. Seneth was a bit unique compared to Dysolis. He capitalized his I&#39;s, avoided run-on sentences, had halfway-decent spelling, actually seemed to be restraining himself from his usual rage. But no, when he gets pissed off, his cover slips.

I have an exact copy of the conversation that was held by Rodngar and
myself and it does not imply that I was there to bribe him of anysort. I
was comprimising Rodngar&#39;s willingnise to stay in the city to prevent us
from more drama. I wanted to get concreate proof on how they felt on his
crimes and this is the response I was given they basicly laughed in my
face and said that it won&#39;t be fair to kick him out now.
I would like to further clarify that there was no mentiong of my
willingness to accept Rodngar&#39;s support, I fully despise this person and
feel that he should now without a doubt he removed from the city. I find
that everyone among the city will also agree with myself included that
this monster needs to go and hopefully can never return

I feel that I was being fair in giving him a second chance a citizenship
despite the fact that he has killed my mother Briaria several times.
Briaria didn&#39;t do anything she was innocent and I was sticking up for
her. I didn&#39;t mean to harm the city of Gaudiguch and I aplogize for

So. Spelling slips up. Tries to make a bargaining position by assuming that, even after all of his alts have been ousted, he will end up being Mayor in the end.

Dumb enough to not realize that Aoife isn&#39;t threatening to throw him out, but that she&#39;s instead parroting his established (stupid) premise. Cuts out half the log to try and make himself look innocent and immediately tries to sweep it under the rug. (You can see parts of the ensuing shitstorm earlier in this log). Moving on:

GAUDIGUCH NEWS #279
Date: 11/5/2010 at 6:44
From: Mystic Seneth Ama&#39;rua, Formless Vindicator
To  : Everyone
Subj: leader

Greetings citizens of freedom

I would like to clarify a few more things that I have said in my
previous post for which I was running for Mayor is not as concrete as I
would like it to be. I will be talking about how I if elected Mayor will
be helping the city as a whole. In my eyes the city can have room to
grow and become part of the wonderful life of the basin as we know it to
be. I will become a fair Mayor one who will be respectful and make sure
the laws have more of an understanding of what they mean and hopefully
will improve security among our freedom.

There is a problem with how the laws have been interpreted and as though
they need changing we need to first state what those laws are. As
priority, the first one should be that Murder of another citizen unless
provoked is unacceptable. If you are attacked you will have the right to
defend yourself and then the law will place punishment on the one who
started the attack.
 
For example if Seneth was attacked by Rodngar then Seneth has the right
to defend himself until the threat was finished by death or interference
from another party. I feel that the laws should have more of a scale
system which rates how severe the punishment can be from the law, which
will be decided on how important it is.

1.Killing a citizen will be met with direct removal from the city. 2. To
trade with an nation that we are at war with such as Hallifax will
result in one city-disfavour and the person cannot be favored until six
months time.
3. Participating in enemy quests that prevent our citizens from
accomplishing ours is an offense that will require two city-disfavors
and will not be favored for exactly one year. I feel that these laws are
all that we need to follow.

I propose that we continue to become better influencers and combatants
so that one day we can obtain villages for our self. The ways we need to
start things is by setting up two teams an influencer team and combat
team which will appoint team leaders. With this setup we can prioritize
coordination becoming the number one goal. Although I believe we can do
it on our own we still need a large amount of help from our allies. The
way shops are run should receive a significant tax cut to help promote
selling wares in our city. I have noticed that a lot of shops have been
closed and the shops that we do have in the city do not have any wares
in them.
I want Gaudiguch to thrive but we cannot thrive if our market has less
to zero products to sell. I hope that our shops will be full that will
draw in outsiders to buy from our stores which will make our city a
lively place to live in.
I will promote fairness and equality among our city and I will not
ignore any citizens that may of have a concern or issue they want to
bring up. Our goal for Gaudiguch is to make sure that the citizens are
treated with respect and outsiders that visit us are also treated the
same way so that they might like to live here on e day.

You&#39;re really dumb, dude.

Everyone&#39;s been posting about &#39;omg the One Law this&#39; and &#39;omg the One Law that&#39; and nobody has half a brain to realize what it&#39;s about. I would be delightfully surprised if anyone Gaudiguch had the slightest idea of what the One Law really is, where it came from (OOCly), or if they have the slightest idea of why they should hate Hallifax based on social and philosophical differences. (No, "crystal freaks" does not make deep RP.) I don&#39;t think anyone post-Aleria&#39;s vaginal clowncar invasion understands what this is about.

This is not a conflict of Chaos versus Order. It&#39;s Chaos versus Harmony, and the extent to which the respective society applies the principles of Order to further their goals. Gaudiguch applies finite amounts of Order in certain places (via the One Law) in order to protect the freedoms of the individual. Hallifax applies Order in broad strokes to create a caste system and a totalitarian state for the betterment of society itself.

And that Chaos vs. Harmony thing? Illustrated everywhere. The purifying flux of chaos in a city that operates on an orchestrated anarchy juxtaposed against a city that divides itself geographically by wards and precincts, with the lower castes being unable to enter the Over City without express permission. The shifting flesh of Vortex versus the sterile, unchanging Continuum. Chaos is change, strife, conflict, anarchy, flames, fathomless paradigms. Harmony is stagnation, mutability, oppression, sterility, injustice.

And the One Law? It&#39;s Estarra inserting an occult reference right into the middle of the city under everyone&#39;s noses. From Aleister Crowley&#39;s Book of Law:

"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. 
Love is the law, love under will."

Further explanation follows:

Without love, compassion,
and reverence for all life,
A powerful soul can damage,
Or even destroy another soul.
Love must be the foundation of all higher learning.
Without Love...
"Compassion is the vice of kings." says the Book.
Evil,
Beyond description, Will be the Law.

I may have cited the wrong book, there, but you get the idea. The One Law is basically the mayoral omnitool: you obey the mayor and the Freedom Council as they interpret the One Law however they wish. It&#39;s -supposed- to be used for good. If they abuse it, it&#39;s your responsibility to revolt, cause anarchy, cause an uprising, and get the tyranny out of the government. If they abuse it, maybe in retrospect it was wrong to elect a moron that would turn around and pit the law against you. Sadly, foresight is probably beyond these people. Kalikai agrees:

Subj: Lack of Perspective

Shard, I have watched you drive your personal agenda for a while now.

Your words are not inspired by fact. You base your claims on second hand
information, without ever feeling the need to investigate the truth. You
speak of &#39;several&#39; deaths of one shard to another when there was only
ever one. This is fact - and it has been established by your own Council
no less. Indeed, it is a fact you should have been aware of, for you
wrote it yourself, on these boards. Yet you still continue to spread a
lie.

Your recent posts contributes nothing substantial to the election or
your bid for Mayor. Instead, it bears testimony to the severe dislike
you harbour for several members of this city and your preposterous
behaviour in political matters.

A law has been broken. Consequences will follow. It is not upon you to
base these consequences upon nothing but your very personal distaste. A
Mayor especially should be capable of seeing beyond his personal
feelings and lead by example. I have seen nothing of you that would
suggest you even know how to do this.

You may call this city your home, but you have not understood what makes
Gaudiguch the City of Freedom. You have not understood the very
principles that you, as Mayor, would be expected to uphold.

You call for a witch hunt when it is compromise and unity that the city
needs at a time like this.

Bear the brunt of My - very personal - distaste for your dangerous lack
of perspective.

GAUDIGUCH NEWS #281
Date: 11/5/2010 at 15:09
From: Kalikai, the Crimson Eye
To  : Everyone
Subj: Remember Who You Are

Do you remember, shards, what this place is that you call home? You call
it the City of Freedom, but how many of you know what this truly
implies?

In recent years you have suffered from chaos and unrest - much of which
can be traced back to a simple fact: You have lost any sense for your
identity. Each shard struggles on their own, lacking a communal
direction.

Let Me tell you then, of the city I was invited to patron by your
founder all those years ago:


&#39;Gaudiguch is the city of Freedom&#39;, she said, &#39;where each may do as they
wish as long as it brings no harm to another citizen. Some of the
unenlightened would also claim it to be the city of chaos and anarchy,
but this is not true. Structure and order exist, but they are only
tools, used to protect the individual.&#39;

&#39;And it is the individual and self-identity&#39;, she said with emphasis,
&#39;which makes Gaudiguch the City of Freedom. Our laws have always been
simple and direct, and always used for the single purpose of protecting
the individual. They can all be traced to One Law, which encompasses and
expresses them all: Do as
thou wilt is the whole of the law so long as you do not interfere with
the will of another.&#39;

&#39;It has always been our belief&#39;, she continued, &#39;that any government
exists only to serve and protect the individual
to enable everyone to follow the path he or she desires. We have never
sought to conquer the Basin, but we always brought our message of
Freedom to the masses, seeking to liberate the dominated and oppressed.&#39;

&#39;Of course&#39;, she added, &#39;this has not always been easy. There were
always those that sought to convert us to their beliefs and threatened
our independence. Those that wanted us to adopt their way of life as the
only true one and worked to destroy us for no other reason than to
dominate what remains. But we have always stood strong and
uncompromising. Together we repelled each and every one of them.&#39;

&#39;And we must continue to do so.&#39;, she said fiercely, her expression not
unlike that of a mother protecting her young. &#39;We will never allow
others to dictate us how we should live and we will always seek to free
the oppressed and teach them about the Freedom found only within
Gaudiguch. This is who and what we are.&#39;


It was this fire and strength of will, her relentless belief and intense
passion, that drew Me to your city.

Gaudiguch will always be a place of varying beliefs and viewpoints,
petty quarrels and calls for revolution. This is Gaudiguch. This is the
City of Freedom. It is a city you all should be proud to be a part of.

And it is also a city where each and every one of you should never
forget the words of your founder.

(She&#39;s basically c/ping parts of Scuchidira&#39;s last post to Hallifax prior to her death, much like how Cririk posted in Hallifax.)

There was a lot of potential in this city, once you weeded out the pot-smoking snugglies that obnoxiously flaunted their obnoxiousness in your face. There were plans. Secret underground Illuminati libraries full of esoteric lore, from the Enlightened Masters long since past. Templars recovering their old wyvern-rider heritage. Resurrecting the old Dragon&#39;s Ball festival from Alin&#39;dor. Having Templars act a role-played bodyguards to high-ranking Illuminati. Examining the architectural similarities between Alindor and Gaudiguch, evidenced by the secret tunnels that run underneath the city. Examining how and where everything went wrong when, in the past, the three races coexisted peacefully in the Skarch. Discovering the origins of Drachou, formed of the &#39;Dreams of the People of Gaudiguch&#39;. Uncovering bits and pieces of Project Paradox.

If we had an Elostian, we&#39;d have probably been able to implement all these fun things.

(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Last night Seneth starts quoting the law to me, then goes."

(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, ""Wait, I read it. It doesn&#39;t say what will happen to you if you break it.""

(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "I went."

(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, ""You&#39;re right.""

(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "He goes "DAMN.""

So have fun in your substanceless Ashtan, run by Dysolis and Munsia. It&#39;ll be fun.

To end on a less depressing note:

(): Rodngar says, "I would do lines of coke crafted from the incinerated corpses of my enemies if it were sanitary."

(): Aoife says, "......"

(): You say, "Wow."

(): Penelope says, "That&#39;s hot."

Lulz.'>I'm not sure where to start this log, so I'll establish background + cover prior events. Lehki asks what's going on and why Rodngar isn't gone yet:
(): You say, "Unless a mayor is elected, Rod cannot be booted."
(): Lyria says, "We were waiting out the election to make an exit."
(): Lehki says, "Oh?"
(): Lyria says, "And he can if the divine boot him."
(): You say, "Aleria/Relk/Lyria, need 3 to kick, no mayor."
(): Lyria says, "Kalikai already said she won't involve herself."
So he's stirring up whatever he desires on his way out, causing a great deal of lulz.
Sorry in advance - the removal of my prompt is really inconsistent. I can't be arsed to go through ALL THAT.
A few days after this, Kalikai is acting IC and muttering about divine retribution if Gaudiguch forces her two Order Heads out of the city as a result of all the drama. To clarify - this is a goddess being attached to her followers, and expressing this in private to them over Order channels.
I've always been skeptical about Kalikai's effectiveness as an administrator - she operates largely behind-the-scenes and rarely talks to anyone outside of her own order. Even then, only her order heads have the slightest inkling of what she's up to. While she's lazy, she's definitely inscrutible and is playing the 'unreadable tactician' role to the T.
More CT crap, spanning a day or two:
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "She denied me access to the Eternal Flame to
continue my work keeping the peace and patrolling the Plane of Fire."
(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "I blocked his power for his
debt and he felt it enough justification to slaughter me in cold blood I even
sat down did not raise a hand to him."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "You rose no hand to me because you have no will to
do anything besides be a sycophant, wench."

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "The One Law is as follows, "The Law is Love; Love
under Will". If it becomes nessecary, in order to maintain Love under Will,
than it can be justified to perform certain actions, including killing people.
It's up to the Freedom Council to decide what is needed."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "No, from would be attacker, Ayden. I was the
Hand once, I know the responsibilities."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Others were ousted for the same offence."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He thinks he's above the law."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He is horribly wrong."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "And i was the Supreme Paragon."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Touch her again and I will kill you myself."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Touch any citizen and i will see your death down to
novicehood."
(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "There were no attackers, and
he had plenty of power it's a simple thing to repay his debt... Veracruz was
blocked yet he did NOT go on a killing spree."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "So, you'd break the law to punish him for the
same? How...smart..."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Interestingly enough yes. That would put you in the
exact same position as Rodngar."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He should be ousted and wouldnt be a citizen if the
law applied to him."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Like it does everyone else."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Again, it is within the One Law to execute people for
going against the One Law."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "I say let Rodngar throw his little tantrum, it will
only show his character."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "So long as no Mayor reigns, no law reigns as well."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Actually it's called definding the citizens."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "So not the same."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "Well, then let's just oust everyone that's ever
infringed on another persons Will. Oh, wait, we do that and we won't have ANY
citizens left!"
(Gaudiguch): Hintaro says, "Rubish, the law should always remain."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "There is still a council."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "The Freedom Council can order people executed, if it
is truly for the best, and most of them are in agreement."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Who isn't getting consulted until things are already
way out of hand."
(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "Did the council order briaria executed?"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "No."
(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "Then what difference does that make?"
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "The Freedom Council doesn't have to do that, and,
indeed, probably shouldn't in most cases. But it's an option if it ever needs
to happen."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "For about five minutes of the next day, you should
seriously step back from thinking about any -one person-, and think about what
exactly it is that's ripped Gaudiguch in half since the day it existed again."

Relk, whoever."

weed. And corruption months/all the injustices associated with it."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Much, much larger."

(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "There is nothing narrow minded about allowing
injustices."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "And it continues to be divided."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I will kill no citizens so

business and paid the price."

the Archmage has advised."

Why is this any different with Rodngar?"

bigger picture."

suggestion."
(Gaudiguch): Aletta says, "Can't we just stop thinking about ourselves for
once? We have the potential to be the GREATEST city in the Basin but all we do is think about ourselves. If we thought about the city as a whole just every once in awhile we'd be so much better than we are now."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Like I said, the problem will still exist because
nobody in this city can think beyond "Right now.""
(Gaudiguch): Aletta says, "I think that's what the Archmage and the Lady are
trying toget at."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "If we weren't a group of
power hungry fools, this city WOULD be great, Aletta."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Oh i will? Some of us actually protect the law you
and Kalin created yet now you do nothing when action needs made."
(Gaudiguch): Arandor (from the Aetherways) says, "Your actions have
consiquences... Briaria was killed for powerblocking you when it is her job to
do so as one of the city power aides."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Krin was also kicked for killing a citizen."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Is it possible that you can switch to a different
subject, or are you intent on being stuck to it for the rest of the month?"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Funnily it didnt take a second though eh?"
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "Krin was kicked for much more
than 'killing a citizen'."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I was pretty sure I was talking about a bigger
picture, and asked the other topics to be put on hold for five minutes."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "She is not the Power
Minister and was over-ridden by a Council member. That should have told her to
stop blocking him."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "But then again, perhaps I misheard myself."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "No, you did Archmage.
These people don't listen, as usual."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "You're avoiding this one though. And the power is
your hands Lyria, to make a step in the right direction, if you believed in the
laws you created, and what you previously upheld, for different individuals."

(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "We're going to Nil in a handbasket. Start rowing. Pun
intended."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He should be ousted like every other person that
broke that law."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "At this moment, I am yes."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "She is worried about the
state of our city and how it has been divided from the start due to power
hungry individuals that cannot be satisfied."
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "However, it does me no good to speak because all
anyone wants to do is talk about the here and now."
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "And such it will remain."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "So Alexandera, look at who has been in power since
our city was started."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Yes and as alot of us agree that he should be
ousted."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "I'm well aware. I helped
keep Kalin in power for years."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "I think that might fix someone of the bickering no?"
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Here, I have a good, salient point about why
Gaudiguch is failing! Let's talk about that."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I'm sincerely astounded at how much you've missed my
point."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "May i speak, Lyria?"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "I think you are trying to deter away from mine."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Or the point that what I'm saying in this exact
moment has zero to do with Rodngar."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Lyria, your point is well taken. But it is not an
excuse to shy away from the law."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Or that it's a whole separate issue. Wow. And yes,
Ayden, of course."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And not an excuse to not act."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No it is not."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Gaudiguch is failing because people here have an
unrealistic expectation about the nature of Freedom."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Please listen."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Thank you Iytha."
(Gaudiguch): Penelope says, "I am the Minister of Power. I am telling you to
stop blocking him. I WILL NOT watch anyone die over this other than myself."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly when the powerminister doesnt wish for
someone to break the law."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And allows someone to over draw because of it."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Thank you, Penelope."
Caerulo gives a pained sigh.
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And now he controls the power from the flame,
because of fear. You shouldn't have to fear the death of another citizen,
Penelope. And certainly not your own."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "What position has that caused in our city?"
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "What is with the childishness of this city? One
powerblock over something initially stupid has very severe backlashes on a
whole city?"
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "What position was the city in before this Aleria?"
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Wow, much the same."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "The people change. The situation does not."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Because the same people had been in power. Until
recently."
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No it wasnt...people got punished for it."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Archmage Lyria, you definitely have a point. I have
noticed the division since I joined Gaudiguch and it's a problem that needs to
be dealth with. But currently, there is problem that needs to be dealt with
now. Which is why so many of the citizenry is up in arms. I believe when the
current problem is settled that we can deal with the Division that we've had."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Perhaps we can."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "I agree with Ayden."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly."
(Gaudiguch): Leesa says, "I think I picked the wrong city. Rodngar, if you
killed a power person for blocking your power because you were in debt, you are
a sad sad little man who should pay his debts. Any citizen who would defend you
under the definition of freedom is stupid."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Thank you."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Well said Leesa."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Lyria, I ask that you vote to uncitizen Rodngar for
his blatant disrespect of Council members and taking the One Law into his own
hands as well as threatening the Minister of Power."
(Gaudiguch): Leesa says, "I picked this city for a reason."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "No."
(Gaudiguch): Leesa says, "Freedom."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "This is not about power debt."
(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "Its about murder, thats what its about."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "He is the Champion, Leesa.
It's part of his job to draw power. And she denied him part of his job,
repeatedly, even after being over-ridden by a Council member. Think on that for
a moment. A measly little power aide thought they had more authority than a
Council member."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No it's about you murderering someone for your own
justification."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I murdered her after warning
her."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "You killed a citizen. That has gotten many before
you kicked out of the city. Why is this different now?"
(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "Murder is murder."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "As I've stated. At this particular time, I'm not
punishing either side."

(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Can i interupt for a moment?"

before?"
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Can i interupt for a moment?"

(Gaudiguch): Relk (from the Aetherways) says, "Don't give the over-ridden by a
Council member speach for him Alexandera. Look at last months log."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Ofcourse not..you wouldnt get rid of someone you
backed."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Yes, just do it."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "As he has stated himself."
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Can i interupt for a moment?"
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Veracruz, most recently."
(Gaudiguch): Hintaro says, "So telling someone that your going to murder them
makes it okay."
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Ok."
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Well."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And I think before him was... did someone say Krin?"
(Gaudiguch): Leesa says, "I heard someone say that there was no security threat
that needed power. That's one of the first things that got me thinking about
all this bickering."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Relk, do not treat me as I
know nothing of this city. I have been here longer than you and been part of
holding it together numerous times."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "Veracruz, one person that has a temper. So what."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Meaning?"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Ofcourse...so did munsia and that person wasnt a
citizen."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Imagine that."
(Gaudiguch): Relk (from the Aetherways) says, "I am only speaking the truth
Alexandera."
(Gaudiguch): Alaina (from the Aetherways) says, "I can't hear myself think
either, Leesa."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Interesting how Lyria is not answering, when Ayden's
address was to her specifically."
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Aside from all the drama and hate and anger, we've
been pretty decent as a city since my time here but i have to say... its good
to see so many citizens awake at the same time."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "What is one murder, a little bit of expierence to
blocking a Champion from power. Expierience can be regained."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "You are speaking your
version of it. Just as I am giving my opinion."
(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "A measily little power aide
so citizens are less worthy to live Alexandera no I think not. He was told if
he paid it back he'd be unblocked but he resorted to threats and unjustified
murder. But I suppose that's fine and good.. he had power he didn't need to be
unblocked Veracruz was champion but he was blocked your arguements are moot."
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Now lets please stop the drama and violence and
stuff."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Briaria, I have been a
power aide far longer than you. Do not speak to me in that manner again."
(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "Alexandera I speak as I
please and you nor anyone else commands me."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "How about since this is okay....you all decide he
shouldnt be punished right now."
(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "Pray you remember that in the
future."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Then again, perhaps Lyria is not answering because
of the noise. But I have my doubts."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Why dont we just start citizening munsia
back..veracruz...krin."
>> Hold this.
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And everyone and just have right o party of it."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "Aleria, I never once told you
that you may not punish me, but right now, you are incapable of doing so."
(Gaudiguch): Aletta says, "Hey guys? Hey-- it's a beautiful morning."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "Go ahead, they would
actually improve the state of this city right now Aleria."
(Gaudiguch): Akui says, "Hmmm, yes. Keep arguing, all of you. I demand it of
you."
(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "You think theyd come back?"
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "In several months, you can do
what you wish."
(Gaudiguch): Aletta says, "I bet if we all just calm down we can get a lot
accomplished."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Oh yeah they would."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And in the meantime Rod? You will kill who you wish?"
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Alright, folks. I'm making a speech. Get over to the
Flame."
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Ok..."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "You're going to do what you want to do irregardless
Aleria."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And Lyria will stand for it, and defend it."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Ofcourse he will..lyria backs him."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "So I'd imagine that's your decision."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Honour you for it, in fact, if she hadn't already."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "I'll stand for it."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Lyria is tired of things."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera (from the Aetherways) says, "More than just Lyria backs
him."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And allows citizens to die ...she didnt last month."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "If that's not injustice and what's tearing the city
apart.. I don't know what is."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "For discrspect to council members."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I will kill nobody who does
not lay hands on me first, how about that, Balian?"
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Briaria declared you?"
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "You're utterly right. One situation in which I don't
vote Rodngar out has been the underlying cause of the city being divided for
decades, Balian."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Shame, shame on me."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "How about we all start acting like grown ups
instead of children for once. That'd be a change."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "No, but it's the current problem."
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CARE, YOU'RE ONLY MAKING
THINGS WORSE AND MAKING US ALL LOOK LIKE FOOLS. ON A DIFFERENT NOTE, IF ANYONE
NEEDS ASSISTANCE PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL DO MY BEST TO HELP YOU ALL."
(Gaudiguch): Arandor says, "Thank you."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Not the indecision. The continuation of the
injustice. And your belittling of it."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "All this time, my little faeling self was the cause."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "You who is supposed to uphold the LAW."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "But not for friends.. NO, definetely not for
friends!"
(Gaudiguch): Nirrain says, "It may not be the cause. However, it will only
cause a bigger divide."
(Gaudiguch): Sivali says, "Hah, I'm just going to say it, go ahead and scream
insanity at me or whatever. It's a fucking game. Grow up. Have fun. Stop making
all sorts of god damn DRAMA. I swear, every single thing IRE puts out is the
same damn thing. Go ahead, shun me for breaking character, you all are guilty
of it as well, acting like damned children the last few days. Anywho, I know
I'm not much for this city, just a little undersecretary in the Pyromancers,
but whatever. There, it's been said, and I'm gone. Later kids. &lt;3."
>> Yeah, Sivali is actually from Achaea. Ashtan in particular.
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "No, Balian, but Briaria
stated her aggression through blocking me and overriding a command of a Council
member."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Correct me if I'm wrong, but most of this city has
balked at the mere thought of a law from the get go."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "The divide will grow regardless."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Now everyone wants to swear by it? Goodness."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Do it's clear. She DIDN'T lay hands on you."
(Gaudiguch): Briaria (from the Aetherways) says, "I was NEVER commanded by any
council member to not do my duty."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "It's been in place for years, Lyria. What's your
point?"
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "We've upheld it before, haven't we?"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "My point right now is that you've missed my point."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "YOU've upheld it before. Why not now? When it's your
friend on the line?"
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "Briaria, read the logs. Lyria, a Council member,
reversed your blocking him. That should have been enough."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "You cant justify protecting him."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "No matter how you try."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "No. Ayden made the point that You've missed."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I didn't justify it."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "I wonder what Kalikai would think of her city now? A
pitiful city divided over a power block, a murder justified, and trying to
regain law in a city that does not follow laws."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "And you refused to address it, because you have no
answer."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Matter of fact, Rodngar, did I not tell you your
actions weren't the proper ones?"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Then uphold the law as it always has been."
(Gaudiguch): Seneth says, "Perhaps we can all calm down a moment?"
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Uhh.. you honored him for standing up for what he
believes in."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And remove the one that has killed our citizens."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I've stated, oh this will be the ninth time here."
(Gaudiguch): Valtorin says, "The point is, Lyria is a prime example of what is
wrong with the city, twist the law to suite them, and then ignore it when it
doesn't, that is the point."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Or did my eyes deceive me?"
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "That was before he killed anyone, Balian."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Neither side was completely in the right."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "You did, but as a free
individual, I am entitled to my own action."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Oh I did Balian. He hadn't killed anyone yet."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Exactly."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "And you must pay for them, Rodngar."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Right. It was only for disrespecting TWO council
members."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And you are entitled to be punished for it to."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I will pay for them when you
can remove me rightfully."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I was unaware you were in my head!"
(Gaudiguch): Relk (from the Aetherways) says, "Rodngar you are not acting like
a free individual. You are acting like an anarchist."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "The couch to your left is rather comfortable."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "The only reason you arent removed."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Mhm.. If I was in the Pyromancers and was -enemying-
Rod, would you honour me Lyria, for standing up for what I believe in?"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Is because lyria protects you."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And no one is blind to it."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "I don't think so. You could disfavour at the
-least-."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "Indeed, Aleria - do you see
me denying that though?"
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "No one is blind to anyone else either. Which has
again, been my point for the past half day."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "He has had two disfavours. That is plenty."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar (from the Aetherways) says, "I have had two disfavours and
a headache for each to boot."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Your point is a scapegoat Lyria."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Thank you, Balian."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He deserves what everyone else got."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "For the same crime."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And ousting."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "He's not beyond that."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Lyria says he is."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Two disfavours is hardly punishment enough."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "With her actions. Or lack thereof."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I do enjoy words getting put in my mouth."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Ocourse he is while the laws are corrupted to suit
means."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Please calm down everybody."
(Gaudiguch): Valtorin says, "My only hope is that when this election is over,
is that both Rodngar and Lyria are promptly removed and enemied for the crimes
they have committed against the city."
(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "You know thats not going to work at all, right
ayden?"
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "That was their original plan to begin with, Valtorin."
(Gaudiguch): Balian says, "Or if they have the decency, to remove themselves."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Actually there wasnt one."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "You want to oust the Archmage? How interesting."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Okay."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "Bah."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "I am not one to remove people unjustly."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "City of Complaints."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Wether i disagree with them or not."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "However rodngar has broken a law that goes beyond
disagreements."
(Gaudiguch): Akui says, "All tyrants respect freedom. They merely wish your
freedom to be their own so that they may more perfectly respect it. By the same
token, the anarchist hates all law... save those that grant them what they
want."
(): Lyria says, "Xeonis tells you, "Mind removing my Ama'rua
please?""
(): Lehki says, "Nice."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Righto. I've been asked to repeat my long-arsed
speech at the Flame. Enjoy."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Without understanding the true nature of Freedom,
freedom is but a word. Let us contemplate the nature of Freedom: Freedom is not
a simple thing to have. Freedom is, of course, not found by saying "Everything
is forbidden, nothing is permitted." That is obvious. Less obvious is the fact
that it is equally impossible to maximize freedom by simply declaring a maxim
of "Nothing is forbidden, everything is permitted" and letting people do what
they like to who they like. Such a society will always fail, just as much as
the former. Thus, we must accept that for each "freedom to", there also exists
a "freedom from" which we must also weight. We must choose, for each possible
deed, if we wish to be free from it being done, or if we will be free do it."
(): Akui says, "Not on the fucking aether idiot."
(Gaudiguch): Alaina (from the Aetherways) says, "My ears are bleeding."
(Gaudiguch): Akui says, "Not the whole speech on the aether..."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "As those that know me know..I havent backed seneth
before now."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "It is a simple enough concept, long-windedness aside."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis says, "You realize half the people in this city didn't
understand a word of that speech?"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "You want a city that actually abides by it's laws."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "And doesnt work to keep corruption in positoins."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Then vote for him."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Or even caerulo."
(Gaudiguch): Alaina (from the Aetherways) says, "I haven't even had a chance to
hear it all yet."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Welcome to Gaudiguch! Seelie!"
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "It is better to be free from getting mugged, eaten
and maimed than it is to be free to do all that to who you like."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Because both at least know what is right and just."
(Gaudiguch): Alaina (from the Aetherways) says, "For all the blabbering, I
can't hear myself think, let alone absorb anyone's words. Dunno if anyone
realizes that effect."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "Eventually it'll end up quiet."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Can we please move this to a different location so we
can talk like people?"
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Let's not air our dirty laundry."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "A little late for that thought..."
(Gaudiguch): Seelie says, "Erm, Hello?"
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Hi."
(Gaudiguch): Seneth says, "Everyone please calm down."
(Gaudiguch): Alexandera says, "Greetings Seelie."
(Gaudiguch): Vannodis says, "Hello."
(Gaudiguch): Alaina (from the Aetherways) says, "Hello, Seelie."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "I see you've got the aether figured out."
(Gaudiguch): Alaina (from the Aetherways) says, "You'll probably need to CTOFF
so you can read your collegium scrolls!"
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Feel free to join in this rousing arguement, if you
like, or do as Alaina says and ignore us lot."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Would sombody like to suggest a forum where we could
discuss things?"
(Gaudiguch): Seelie says, "I got lessons for saying hello."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "I don't think it can be discussed."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "The bar seems good enough."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Yep."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria says, "It's a flurry of insults and yelling."
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Archmage, it needs to be discussed with a moderator."
(Gaudiguch): Boden (from the Aetherways) says, "That's what it has become, yes."
(Gaudiguch): Boden (from the Aetherways) says, "I volunteer to be said
moderator."
(Gaudiguch): Boden (from the Aetherways) says, "If anyone still wishes to
discuss."
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis (from the Fire Elemental Plane) says, "Welcome to the city
of insults, complaints, and lies."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "I'll moderate. I seem to be the only one who's not
calling anyone a scum-barrel or something."
(Gaudiguch): Seelie says, "Um, perhaps I'm dreaming?"
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "It's quite possible."
4260h, 4140m, 4140e, 10p, 18800en, 18800w elrx-
(Gaudiguch): Xeonis (from the Fire Elemental Plane) says, "How about we bring
in a neutral person from a different city."
(Gaudiguch): Seelie says, "I can moderate, maybe? I don't know anyone of you."
>> lol. Remember this for later.
(Gaudiguch): Ayden says, "Heheh."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Oh yeah that will help alot."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "Nah, focus on your lessons."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Bring another person from another city to make a
mockery of ours."
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "We're all crazy, and half of them are drunken
scumbarrels."
(Gaudiguch): Seelie says, "I'm confused, I thought this was a free city of
fun??"
(Gaudiguch): Iytha says, "No."

Subj: This whole mess
Everyone,
I want to say a few things about this whole... mess. First off, Lyria, I
do not wish to see you ousted or leave the city. I think you have done a
rather well job being Senator. Secondly, Rodngar, you commited murder,
which is wrong no matter what. There is a difference in self defence and
outright cold blooded murder and you need to accept the fact that you
are not above the laws to which each and everyone one of us have to
abide by. Thirdly, splitting this city apart as we are doing now has
created nothing but chaos anarchy and made complete jokes out of
ourselves and the great city of Gaudiguch. I ask you all to very kindly
shut up, stop bickering amongst ourselves and get order back in the
reigns. This has done nothing but tear this city down when there were
already holes in the stitching. Not myself nor any single one person can
make those mends. It will take ALL of us to build this back up. There is
no point in this. It was a simple contestion and WE ALL let it get to
this point whether you have said words or not. Everyone is at fault here
and if you want to blame and point fingers take a look in a mirror and
point there. Cast that blame there. I say we stop fighting. I say we
stop dividing ourselves. Stop letting this crap take down our glorious
city. That's all I have to say, take whatever has been said in the past
roll it up in a tiny little piss ball and throw it in the trash. Because
until you do that nothing will be solved and at some point something
terrible will happen.
So I leave you all with one parting thought to contemplate. Is all this
really worth the fall of Gaudiguch?
Forever in service,
Relk Ama'rua

Subj: Elections and Enlightenment
Citizens! I have a very important announcement to make!
Yesterday, a few chaps and I decided to seek Enlightenment. So we
grabbed the nearest hookah and had a truly beatific session. After a few
hours of smoking and contemplation of the insightful visions, we came to
a very important conclusion. Important enough that I wanted to share it
with all of you:
Let me tell you of the venerable reveller who attempted to punish his
parents. This reveller traveled to New Celest. Unthinkingly, the
reveller sought the cold-hearted lucidian and wept.
Unfortunately, we had to keep the hookah lit and ran out of cinder
sometime during the night. We used those little papers lying around
everywhere instead. It was only today that I realized those were the
voting papers.
So! My other message to you is that those with ambitions have to contest
again and the rest will have to recast their votes. But considering the
important piece of enlightenment I could share with you, this is a small
price to pay right?
Sincerely,
Deotathi Miim

And suddenly, the election has been reset entirely. Why did this happen?
Maybe this explains a few things:

We are serous about holding seconds to a much higher standard of
roleplay when it comes to making sure there is no hint of overlap
between the two characters. Thus, the file for HELP SECONDS has been
updated with the following paragraph:
"IT IS HIGHLY ADVISED THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TWO ACTIVE SECONDS IN THE
SAME CITY OR COMMUNE. The temptation is too great to blur the RP lines
between seconds in the same organization, as it becomes too easy to
enter into the same families or join the same clans, even voting in
lockstep with each other, etc. The bottom line is that seconds must be
kept completely separate from each other."

A strange, motley crew of individuals. Valis even had all 5 lines for the Gaudiguch Epic Quest. Why the sudden rush to leave? Nothing implicating on any of their honors, save for one person being part of the Pirates of the Hearth clan, where Aleria/Relk like congregating their aetherhunting brood.
Our first reflex after admin intervention or the resolution of an issue is to check and see if anyone gets shrubbed. In every challenge against Kalin, some random alt makes a post on the Gaudiguch news board and either suicides or gets shrubbed.
None of the main players here are shrubbed. Nobody on FAMILY TREE AMA'RUA, none of the contesters, not Aleria or Relk themselves. The sad thing is? With every novice in Gaudiguch being drafted into the Ama'rua within 5 minutes, we would be hard pressed to actually remember possible names for shrubbing. They could have simply been deleted, too.

To cap off this issue of Gaudiguch Drama (which is really full of nonsensical crap on CT):
Dysolis is working with the Ama'rua to take over Gaudiguch.
Finally, after all his incoherent forum rage, he THINKS he is going to win.
He's "been dracnari longer than all you shitheads" ergo he is qualified for mayor.
I've suspected this was the case for a long time:
- If you look back in the logs from earlier, you see: 2010/11/05 01:46:15 - Siniaba quit the city.
- In my time as Illuminati GM, I was approached by Siniaba and asked to join the Illuminati. They were coming from the Pyromancers. I asked - why? As I do with everyone. Why do you want to join my guild? What is your driving RP reason? Why do you want to join the most ancient organization in the Basin? No, Siniaba, "I want to be a guardian" doesn't work, because then you can just go join the Nihilists if you want it that badly. It is not hard to pull an excuse out of your bum. I like to think critical thinking is not impossible for anyone.
- Unfortunately, Siniaba took this question ("Why?") to be my doubting his patriotism as a Gaudiguchian citizen (and other Dysolis-esque pissiness was given in response). Siniaba QQ's as I hit my 'reply Alright, come to me so I can induct you.' command. Twenty minutes later, Seneth appears in the Illuminati, learning on his own. Three hours later, pipes, vials, robes and herbs. Three days later, tri trans skills.
- I suspected at this point that Dysolis = Seneth and that he'd eventually contest for a spot in the Illuminati. He didn't, though - he rode it out, joined the Ama'rua and was immediately set up to be their pawn for Mayor. I started having my doubts. Seneth was a bit unique compared to Dysolis. He capitalized his I's, avoided run-on sentences, had halfway-decent spelling, actually seemed to be restraining himself from his usual rage. But no, when he gets pissed off, his cover slips.

I have an exact copy of the conversation that was held by Rodngar and
myself and it does not imply that I was there to bribe him of anysort. I
was comprimising Rodngar's willingnise to stay in the city to prevent us
from more drama. I wanted to get concreate proof on how they felt on his
crimes and this is the response I was given they basicly laughed in my
face and said that it won't be fair to kick him out now.
I would like to further clarify that there was no mentiong of my
willingness to accept Rodngar's support, I fully despise this person and
feel that he should now without a doubt he removed from the city. I find
that everyone among the city will also agree with myself included that
this monster needs to go and hopefully can never return
I feel that I was being fair in giving him a second chance a citizenship
despite the fact that he has killed my mother Briaria several times.
Briaria didn't do anything she was innocent and I was sticking up for
her. I didn't mean to harm the city of Gaudiguch and I aplogize for
those that might have seemed that I did wrong doing.

So. Spelling slips up. Tries to make a bargaining position by assuming that, even after all of his alts have been ousted, he will end up being Mayor in the end.
Dumb enough to not realize that Aoife isn't threatening to throw him out, but that she's instead parroting his established (stupid) premise. Cuts out half the log to try and make himself look innocent and immediately tries to sweep it under the rug. (You can see parts of the ensuing shitstorm earlier in this log). Moving on:

Subj: leader
Greetings citizens of freedom
I would like to clarify a few more things that I have said in my
previous post for which I was running for Mayor is not as concrete as I
would like it to be. I will be talking about how I if elected Mayor will
be helping the city as a whole. In my eyes the city can have room to
grow and become part of the wonderful life of the basin as we know it to
be. I will become a fair Mayor one who will be respectful and make sure
the laws have more of an understanding of what they mean and hopefully
will improve security among our freedom.
There is a problem with how the laws have been interpreted and as though
they need changing we need to first state what those laws are. As
priority, the first one should be that Murder of another citizen unless
provoked is unacceptable. If you are attacked you will have the right to
defend yourself and then the law will place punishment on the one who
started the attack.
For example if Seneth was attacked by Rodngar then Seneth has the right
to defend himself until the threat was finished by death or interference
from another party. I feel that the laws should have more of a scale
system which rates how severe the punishment can be from the law, which
will be decided on how important it is.
1.Killing a citizen will be met with direct removal from the city. 2. To
trade with an nation that we are at war with such as Hallifax will
result in one city-disfavour and the person cannot be favored until six
months time.
3. Participating in enemy quests that prevent our citizens from
accomplishing ours is an offense that will require two city-disfavors
and will not be favored for exactly one year. I feel that these laws are
all that we need to follow.
I propose that we continue to become better influencers and combatants
so that one day we can obtain villages for our self. The ways we need to
start things is by setting up two teams an influencer team and combat
team which will appoint team leaders. With this setup we can prioritize
coordination becoming the number one goal. Although I believe we can do
it on our own we still need a large amount of help from our allies. The
way shops are run should receive a significant tax cut to help promote
selling wares in our city. I have noticed that a lot of shops have been
closed and the shops that we do have in the city do not have any wares
in them.
I want Gaudiguch to thrive but we cannot thrive if our market has less
to zero products to sell. I hope that our shops will be full that will
draw in outsiders to buy from our stores which will make our city a
lively place to live in.
I will promote fairness and equality among our city and I will not
ignore any citizens that may of have a concern or issue they want to
bring up. Our goal for Gaudiguch is to make sure that the citizens are
treated with respect and outsiders that visit us are also treated the
same way so that they might like to live here on e day.

You're really dumb, dude.
Everyone's been posting about 'omg the One Law this' and 'omg the One Law that' and nobody has half a brain to realize what it's about. I would be delightfully surprised if anyone Gaudiguch had the slightest idea of what the One Law really is, where it came from (OOCly), or if they have the slightest idea of why they should hate Hallifax based on social and philosophical differences. (No, "crystal freaks" does not make deep RP.) I don't think anyone post-Aleria's vaginal clowncar invasion understands what this is about.
This is not a conflict of Chaos versus Order. It's Chaos versus Harmony, and the extent to which the respective society applies the principles of Order to further their goals. Gaudiguch applies finite amounts of Order in certain places (via the One Law) in order to protect the freedoms of the individual. Hallifax applies Order in broad strokes to create a caste system and a totalitarian state for the betterment of society itself.
And that Chaos vs. Harmony thing? Illustrated everywhere. The purifying flux of chaos in a city that operates on an orchestrated anarchy juxtaposed against a city that divides itself geographically by wards and precincts, with the lower castes being unable to enter the Over City without express permission. The shifting flesh of Vortex versus the sterile, unchanging Continuum. Chaos is change, strife, conflict, anarchy, flames, fathomless paradigms. Harmony is stagnation, mutability, oppression, sterility, injustice.
And the One Law? It's Estarra inserting an occult reference right into the middle of the city under everyone's noses. From Aleister Crowley's Book of Law:
"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
Love is the law, love under will."
Further explanation follows:
Without love, compassion,
and reverence for all life,
A powerful soul can damage,
Or even destroy another soul.
Love must be the foundation of all higher learning.
Without Love...
"Compassion is the vice of kings." says the Book.
Evil,
Beyond description, Will be the Law.
I may have cited the wrong book, there, but you get the idea. The One Law is basically the mayoral omnitool: you obey the mayor and the Freedom Council as they interpret the One Law however they wish. It's -supposed- to be used for good. If they abuse it, it's your responsibility to revolt, cause anarchy, cause an uprising, and get the tyranny out of the government. If they abuse it, maybe in retrospect it was wrong to elect a moron that would turn around and pit the law against you. Sadly, foresight is probably beyond these people. Kalikai agrees:

Subj: Lack of Perspective
Shard, I have watched you drive your personal agenda for a while now.
Your words are not inspired by fact. You base your claims on second hand
information, without ever feeling the need to investigate the truth. You
speak of 'several' deaths of one shard to another when there was only
ever one. This is fact - and it has been established by your own Council
no less. Indeed, it is a fact you should have been aware of, for you
wrote it yourself, on these boards. Yet you still continue to spread a
lie.
Your recent posts contributes nothing substantial to the election or
your bid for Mayor. Instead, it bears testimony to the severe dislike
you harbour for several members of this city and your preposterous
behaviour in political matters.
A law has been broken. Consequences will follow. It is not upon you to
base these consequences upon nothing but your very personal distaste. A
Mayor especially should be capable of seeing beyond his personal
feelings and lead by example. I have seen nothing of you that would
suggest you even know how to do this.
You may call this city your home, but you have not understood what makes
Gaudiguch the City of Freedom. You have not understood the very
principles that you, as Mayor, would be expected to uphold.
You call for a witch hunt when it is compromise and unity that the city
needs at a time like this.
Bear the brunt of My - very personal - distaste for your dangerous lack
of perspective.

Subj: Remember Who You Are
Do you remember, shards, what this place is that you call home? You call
it the City of Freedom, but how many of you know what this truly
implies?
In recent years you have suffered from chaos and unrest - much of which
can be traced back to a simple fact: You have lost any sense for your
identity. Each shard struggles on their own, lacking a communal
direction.
Let Me tell you then, of the city I was invited to patron by your
founder all those years ago:
'Gaudiguch is the city of Freedom', she said, 'where each may do as they
wish as long as it brings no harm to another citizen. Some of the
unenlightened would also claim it to be the city of chaos and anarchy,
but this is not true. Structure and order exist, but they are only
tools, used to protect the individual.'
'And it is the individual and self-identity', she said with emphasis,
'which makes Gaudiguch the City of Freedom. Our laws have always been
simple and direct, and always used for the single purpose of protecting
the individual. They can all be traced to One Law, which encompasses and
expresses them all: Do as
thou wilt is the whole of the law so long as you do not interfere with
the will of another.'
'It has always been our belief', she continued, 'that any government
exists only to serve and protect the individual
to enable everyone to follow the path he or she desires. We have never
sought to conquer the Basin, but we always brought our message of
Freedom to the masses, seeking to liberate the dominated and oppressed.'
'Of course', she added, 'this has not always been easy. There were
always those that sought to convert us to their beliefs and threatened
our independence. Those that wanted us to adopt their way of life as the
only true one and worked to destroy us for no other reason than to
dominate what remains. But we have always stood strong and
uncompromising. Together we repelled each and every one of them.'
'And we must continue to do so.', she said fiercely, her expression not
unlike that of a mother protecting her young. 'We will never allow
others to dictate us how we should live and we will always seek to free
the oppressed and teach them about the Freedom found only within
Gaudiguch. This is who and what we are.'
It was this fire and strength of will, her relentless belief and intense
passion, that drew Me to your city.
Gaudiguch will always be a place of varying beliefs and viewpoints,
petty quarrels and calls for revolution. This is Gaudiguch. This is the
City of Freedom. It is a city you all should be proud to be a part of.
And it is also a city where each and every one of you should never
forget the words of your founder.

(She's basically c/ping parts of Scuchidira's last post to Hallifax prior to her death, much like how Cririk posted in Hallifax.)
There was a lot of potential in this city, once you weeded out the pot-smoking snugglies that obnoxiously flaunted their obnoxiousness in your face. There were plans. Secret underground Illuminati libraries full of esoteric lore, from the Enlightened Masters long since past. Templars recovering their old wyvern-rider heritage. Resurrecting the old Dragon's Ball festival from Alin'dor. Having Templars act a role-played bodyguards to high-ranking Illuminati. Examining the architectural similarities between Alindor and Gaudiguch, evidenced by the secret tunnels that run underneath the city. Examining how and where everything went wrong when, in the past, the three races coexisted peacefully in the Skarch. Discovering the origins of Drachou, formed of the 'Dreams of the People of Gaudiguch'. Uncovering bits and pieces of Project Paradox.
If we had an Elostian, we'd have probably been able to implement all these fun things.
(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Last night Seneth starts quoting the law to me, then goes."
(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, ""Wait, I read it. It doesn't say what will happen to you if you break it.""
(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "I went."
(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, ""You're right.""
(): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "He goes "DAMN.""
So have fun in your substanceless Ashtan, run by Dysolis and Munsia. It'll be fun.
To end on a less depressing note:
(): Rodngar says, "I would do lines of coke crafted from the incinerated corpses of my enemies if it were sanitary."
(): Aoife says, "......"
(): You say, "Wow."
(): Penelope says, "That's hot."
