You see a single exit leading east.

The Glade of Observation.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Sprays of chervil cover the forest floor. A sedge of galingale is firmly planted in the forest floor. A hornbeam sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. Reaching up as high as the eye can see looms the awesome presence of a living totem.
You see a single exit leading east.
