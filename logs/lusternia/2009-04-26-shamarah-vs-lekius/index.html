The Aetherware Shoppe. (lost) (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The long, narrow room has been cut into the granite rock in a sharp rectangular shape. Light from the beeswax candles hanging from the iron candelabrum on the ceiling provide enough light to view the wide variety of doors that line the walls. They range from simple pine to sumptuous oak and walnut, from iron wrought doors to massive reinforced steel bulwarks. At the end of the shoppe is a glass cabinet containing the precious spheres and cubes that glitter and churn with inner energies, each waiting for an owner to release their potential dimensional bubbles from which aether manses are formed. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by five pale ancestral spirits. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading south (open door) and up (open door).

The Aetherplex Chamber. (lost) (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The spherical chamber is formed from a hollow geode comprised of dozens of precious gemstones. Large jagged formations of rubies, sapphires, diamonds and emeralds line the walls and ceiling. The floor has been cut and polished to a brilliant shine, revealing concentric circles of brilliant colours. Upon close examination of the glassy floor, shimmering reflections briefly glide across its smooth surface of wondrous mansions and abodes. A current of electricity continuously runs throughout this mineral wonder, causing tiny sparks to erratically blossom up and down the crystalline formations. A stone of jade glitters on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Brother Zaralesis Starleaf is here. He wields a platinum-etched steel tahto with both hands.

The Stairs of the Last Nine. (road). (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Far above, the peak touching the sky seems to resonate with power and an unspoken message; if the earth can touch the heavens, then perhaps mortality can touch immortality. Wear and tear have worn the path smooth, revealing that many have attempted the pilgrimage to the top of the mountain, but not hinting at how many have successfully completed it. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by four pale ancestral spirits.

The Stairs of the Last Nine. (road). (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Below the soaring majesty and thoughtful mystery of Avechna's Peak, a path unfolds and spirals up the mountain's sides, interspersed by rough-hewn stairs. Undertaking the path's journey up that path is an intimidating venture, for its length is long and the end lost beyond the clouds. This intimidation, however, proves paltry in the face of the mountain's hypnotic story of how the mortal races stood against insurmountable odds. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by five pale ancestral spirits.

The Stairs of the Last Nine. (road). (lost) (Avechna's Peak.?)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Below the soaring majesty and thoughtful mystery of Avechna's Peak, a path unfolds and spirals up the mountain's sides, interspersed by rough-hewn stairs. Undertaking the path's journey up that path is an intimidating venture, for its length is long and the end lost beyond the clouds. This intimidation, however, proves paltry in the face of the mountain's hypnotic story of how the mortal races stood against insurmountable odds. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by five pale ancestral spirits.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands.

Black, granite rocks interspersed with the impressions and fossils of thin bones and small creatures speak of the hard times the land has bore witness to. The path slowly shifts from dirt to mica-flecked stone, beginning to lead upwards towards the base of the peak. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by five pale ancestral spirits.
You see exits leading north and south.

The Aetherplex Chamber. (lost) (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The spherical chamber is formed from a hollow geode comprised of dozens of precious gemstones. Large jagged formations of rubies, sapphires, diamonds and emeralds line the walls and ceiling. The floor has been cut and polished to a brilliant shine, revealing concentric circles of brilliant colours. Upon close examination of the glassy floor, shimmering reflections briefly glide across its smooth surface of wondrous mansions and abodes. A current of electricity continuously runs throughout this mineral wonder, causing tiny sparks to erratically blossom up and down the crystalline formations. A stone of jade glitters on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Brother Zaralesis Starleaf is here. He wields a platinum-etched steel tahto with both hands. Bloodletter Miciah Silveshi, Disciple of the Sati is here. He wields a silver tahto staff with both hands. Sovereign Crow, Kialkarkea Diodorus of Shadows and Faerie is here.

The Aetherplex Chamber. (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The spherical chamber is formed from a hollow geode comprised of dozens of precious gemstones. Large jagged formations of rubies, sapphires, diamonds and emeralds line the walls and ceiling. The floor has been cut and polished to a brilliant shine, revealing concentric circles of brilliant colours. Upon close examination of the glassy floor, shimmering reflections briefly glide across its smooth surface of wondrous mansions and abodes. A current of electricity continuously runs throughout this mineral wonder, causing tiny sparks to erratically blossom up and down the crystalline formations. A stone of jade glitters on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Bloodletter Miciah Silveshi, Disciple of the Sati is here. He wields a silver tahto staff with both hands. Brother Zaralesis Starleaf is here. He wields a platinum-etched steel tahto with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded.

The Stairs of the Last Nine. (road). (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Below the soaring majesty and thoughtful mystery of Avechna's Peak, a path unfolds and spirals up the mountain's sides, interspersed by rough-hewn stairs.

This intimidation, however, proves paltry in the face of the mountain's hypnotic story of how the mortal races stood against insurmountable odds. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right.
