A rocky crawlspace. (lost) (Shadowvale Arena.)
The passageway constricts here, the walls tightening dramatically around the 
pseudo-pathway until it disappears in a mess of rubble and broken mineral 
formations. Occasionally, and without explanation, the cave flares outward, its 
edges bleeding into shadows. The roots decorating the ceiling and walls thin 
noticeably, and the residual moisture condensing in tiny rivulets on the 
northern floor suggests this tunnel winds even deeper into the earth.
You see exits leading north and southwest.

A rocky crawlspace. (Shadowvale Arena.)
The passageway constricts here, the walls tightening dramatically around the 
pseudo-pathway until it disappears in a mess of rubble and broken mineral 
formations. Occasionally, and without explanation, the cave flares outward, its 
edges bleeding into shadows. The roots decorating the ceiling and walls thin 
noticeably, and the residual moisture condensing in tiny rivulets on the 
northern floor suggests this tunnel winds even deeper into the earth.
You see exits leading north and southwest.

He is a bouncing furrikin and looks like a large bunny. His big ears sometimes 
flop forward over his dark green eyes. Due to a slight twist, the right ear 
never fully straightens out, it is always folded over at the top. His small 
pink nose and delicate ivory whiskers slowly wiggle as he looks back at you. 
Looking down his furry body you notice that his long slender fingers are 
slightly callused at the ends, due to his profession as a bard. His legs are 
strong and sleek, though their short length suggests that only short sprints 
are practical. His small tail is somewhat cute, it perks up when he is excited. 
He is wearing a shimmering crown of bloodstone, shadowy prayer beads, whispery 
midnight-black robes, a midnight black cloak, black coat of leather and silk, a 
blue bunny backpack, a brilliant white rose, and a featureless white and amber 
mask.

You point the tip of your athame at Pruxi's heart and make a sudden stabbing 
motion. A glowing pentagram shoots from the tip of the athame and slams into

gives one final gasp before falling faceward in death.
You have slain Pruxi.
Defeated, Pruxi is cast out of the Arena.

No one is more at home in the trees than Monkey. In a location with trees, you
can CLIMB UP into the boughs or CLIMB DOWN back to the ground. If someone is in
the trees with you you can SHOVE them off the branches, or SEIZE people on the
ground to bring them to you. Finally, by CLINGing to the branches, you will be
harder to remove from the trees.

Ancient path north of the Wyrden. (road). (Shadowvale Arena.)
This pathway stretches out to the east and west, with an entrance to the forest
to the south. Where the path meets the trees, vines litter the ground, as
though only recently rediscovered. The bones of small creatures lie in a pile

covered in moss of different hues of green, sits here surrounded by many
smaller stones. The western face of this massive rock is covered in strange
writing unknown to any mortal.

He is a bouncing furrikin and looks like a large bunny. His big ears sometimes
flop forward over his dark green eyes. Due to a slight twist, the right ear
never fully straightens out, it is always folded over at the top. His small
pink nose and delicate ivory whiskers slowly wiggle as he looks back at you.
Looking down his furry body you notice that his long slender fingers are
slightly callused at the ends, due to his profession as a bard. His legs are
strong and sleek, though their short length suggests that only short sprints
are practical. His small tail is somewhat cute, it perks up when he is excited.
He is wearing a shimmering crown of bloodstone, shadowy prayer beads, whispery
midnight-black robes, a midnight black cloak, black coat of leather and silk, a
blue bunny backpack, a brilliant white rose, and a featureless white and amber
