Ornately carved room.
A sickly sweet odour, the smell of decomposing corpses, wafts in from a war shrine of Fain nearby. A long rusty chain dangles from the ceiling here. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the south. A massive, grey crow flies here with midnight wings spread. Scordatura Pizzicato, Narsrim D\'cente`, Crescendo of Transformation towers here, shrouded. He wields a darkwood mandolin encased in iron filigree and bone in his left hand and a Wand of Illusions in his right.
You see a single exit leading south.
