From: Mystic Seneth Ama&#39;rua, Formless Vindicator
To  : Everyone
Subj: Leader

Salutations Gaudiguch
Fair Citizens I come to you presently for concern for our great city
Gaudiguch. Its current state is that of stagnation. Many of our
ministers and our current Mayor remain sleeping while our commodity shop
runs out of supplies. Our citizens have a lack of direction and are not
certain of where to turn to for help. I do not fault current leadership
for resting because at times It is unavoidable. However, when the leader
is awake steps should be made to ensure that Gaudiguch continues to
thrive and grow. This is one of the many issues that I wish to rectify.
For those of you not familiar with me, I am an avid combatant and
defender of our city. Currently I hold the positions of Protector and
Undersecretary in the Illuminati, our city&#39;s most active guild. Those
that do know me know I am both ambitious and efficient. Both of my
grandparents our members of our Freedom council, maintaining guildmaster
for both the Templars and Illuminati, so leadership is clearly in my
blood. Some may believe it&#39;s a political conspiracy that is causing me
to contest now. I ensure you all this is not the case. My utmost
priority is Gaudiguch, it&#39;s citizens, and our potential to grow beyond
the state it is in currently. If you ever have any questions feel free
to approach me as I am ever in your service.
Sincerely,  Mystic Seneth Ama&#39;rua
 
Penned by my hand on the 5th of Dvarsh, in the year 280 CE.

OH. Right. It&#39;s election time again.

...

Wait.

>> Both of my grandparents our members of our Freedom council, maintaining 
guildmaster for both the Templars and Illuminati, so leadership is clearly in 
my blood.

Might as well hide your declared intent to take over where everyone can see it, right? Anyways:

From: Rodngar Naresni
To  : Everyone
Subj: Another few years, another few shams!

I was wondering when the family would take another crack at a takeover
in a city, after the travesty that happened in Celest - took longer than
I imagined, though, hm!

So, before I actually air my opinion like offensive-smelling laundry,
let me just go ahead and do what I usually do: read through somebody&#39;s
post again and ask if they seriously just wrote the things they do, give
them a chance to intelligently back out, and then inevitably watch them
refuse to because elections are obviously an all-in process of
tomfoolery.

Seneth, your first point in your post is incredibly vague. It is an
oft-used lie that people stand on in elections here, and let me tell you
now: it doesn&#39;t work. It is a foolish claim. Stagnation does grip this
city, but that stagnation is born of the apathy of the city. A Mayor
cannot force people to do anything in Gaudiguch. A Mayor can incentivize
strengthening the city, but Kalin already has tried that and it did not
work. The citizens lack direction because they come here to do so - this
city is a haven for the lack, unmotivated masses who want nothing more
than to leech off the golden standard of Freedom we once represented.

The Mayor is around every month for days at a time - just because he
doesn&#39;t make a huge amount of noise doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t exist. He
does what work he needs to do - which is sadly not much when the city&#39;s
position is to generally not care about anything in the Basin. You can
say all you like that &#39;people want villages&#39; - but you need to PROVE IT
instead of telling baseless lies. If we wanted them bad enough, we&#39;d
have them - people would take up arms and speak to denizens. We would
have gotten at least one. We haven&#39;t, because the city is a nest of
apathy and that cannot be changed ever. You could as easily teach a fish
to fly or a crow to swim than to try and force a large portion of this
city to do something.

Not only do I question your experience - being an undersecretary and
protector do not qualify you to make large, incredibly important
decisions for this city - but I also question your worth. What do you
have that Kalin does not? You are, to be quite frank, a twenty-year-old
no name who has done nothing as far as I can see. You contesting simply
lowers my opinion of you because, like Anyania, Dysolis, and many others
before you, you seem to simply like complaining. A good prospective
leader would try their very hardest to bring these problems to an end
before contesting, because a wise leader knows that elections create
political upheaval that this city does not need.

As for leadership &#39;being in your blood&#39;, I do not think it is. Your
grandfather is the guildmaster of the Templars simply based on majority
and happenstance of the Grandmistress being missing, and your
grandmother&#39;s performance as Cipher is nothing to truly organize parades
about. Quality leadership is not something you gain by blood - you gain
it through experience over decades. To even state that because you are a
member of a certain family that you would make a great leader is
absolutely deplorable and reminds me of the tainted, oppressive noble
houses of Magnagora - do you truly wish to come off as a person who owns
slaves and oppresses so-called peasants in the name of some invisible
superiority?

Once again, another contestant throws their name in without ANY claims
of substance. You can say this or that until you go blue in the face -
but until you tell me how you will get to the &#39;this or that&#39;, and why it
would work, and just how you intend to get it by this city.. you are
doing nothing but scribbling on paper.

Now, on to my opinions:

I knew that this would happen the moment I heard of the elections in the
Templar. By contesting to control the Templars and owning the Illuminati
by majority, the Ama&#39;rua family has effectively made it impossible to
oppose them if they truly wished to run the city right now if by nothing
but standard process of majority on the Freedom Council. This is clearly
a thinly-veiled plot of conspiracy to take over the City of Freedom - a
sickening act and aim. Those of you who would willingly participate in
this foolish play of power, know this: you are no better than the tyrant
you accused Kalin of being.

Honestly though, who here is honestly surprised? We&#39;ve watched the
guilds change hands in leadership. The members of two of our three
guilds have dug our graves for us - even if this election ends in Kalin
Disanti retaining his position, it will not matter. The family is
capable by sheer majority on the Freedom Council (the only group of
power that matters in this city) of changing anything in this city if
they persist long enough. In truth, we are doing nothing but sitting and
waiting for them to give it a shot. The Freedom that our city was
founded on and seeks to preserve within her walls, on her streets, in
every market stall and office and home of great Gaudiguch is now at
stake. By handing over power to another member of this scheming family,
we face all-out tyranny. They will make our decisions for us, and we
will have no say. In the end, citizens, we are facing a legion of
mindlessly and aggressively adopted children who will put their faith
and weight, unsupported by their non-existant wisdom, behind every
little thing asked of them.

If the city of Gaudiguch elects Seneth, they will most assuredly lose
the true warriors of Freedom - as why would a soldier remain when there
is nothing left to fight for?

Subj: Mayoral election

Greetings, Gaudiguch! In light of the recent vacancy, I am adding my
name to the ballot for Mayor. Now, you&#39;re probably wondering, what does
Arix bring to the table? Well, to be perfectly honest, I&#39;m not a
fighter, and I don&#39;t have family members in important city positions, so
if that&#39;s all you want you will be disappointed. I do have some
experience dealing with people, that tends to happen when you&#39;re old as
dirt. I am also willing to listen to the ideas people have and accept
constructive criticism. If anyone has any questions, just talk to me
later and I will try and answer them. Good luck to whoever else decides
to run!

something is easily fixed."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "And since he&#39;s gone, there&#39;s no 
power to abuse."

(House of Shadows): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Uh, no it doesn&#39;t."

have your own way."

I wasn&#39;t present when he was removed. However, I&#39;ll remove it myself, 
seriously."

(): Aoife says, "Did she just seriously threat to CDF you?"

the city after leaving."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Anyone counting here?"

(Gaudiguch): You say, "Let me see."

(Gaudiguch): Aliod says, "You children have fun, this hurts my head."

(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "It shouldnt matter, not everyones here to vote nor 
would have the chance to."

(Gaudiguch): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Oh hey now. This is what 
everyone agreed to, isn&#39;t it?"

(Gaudiguch): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Along with a load of bickering 
and who&#39;s got more authority."

may its rule be long and prosperous!"

Rodngar&#39;s skin flashes a wild and chaotic assortment of colours before settling 
upon its natural tone.
A length of flame quivers and dies out, leaving behind only cinders.

<< That was the last of anything interesting. tl;dr summary?

Aleria has been jumping every newbie out of the portal in Gaudiguch to induct them into her family.

A combined factor of every member of The Kalin Clique(tm) going inactive at the same time for various reasons lead to Aleria Ama&#39;rua become GM of the Illuminati. Rodngar gets kicked out of GC first (the election was between Eltorinus Ama&#39;rua and Ayden) and then Xypher loses GA despite being active (to Briaria).

Relk Ama&#39;rua takes over GM of the Paladins, and then Detho (3 guesses as to surname) takes GA. None of the Templars can fight so nobody contests Aliod, though this didn&#39;t stop anyone in the Illuminati from trying, clearly.

With Gaudiguch inebriating itself on Keeno McFluffins the Chaos Panda, the Pyromancers are the last guild to &#39;hold out&#39;. Other conspiratory tidbits edited out of the logs, should they come to fruition in the future. >>'>Nataely Primrose shouts, "Long live Gaudiguch!"

Subj: Leader
Salutations Gaudiguch
Fair Citizens I come to you presently for concern for our great city
Gaudiguch. Its current state is that of stagnation. Many of our
ministers and our current Mayor remain sleeping while our commodity shop
runs out of supplies. Our citizens have a lack of direction and are not
certain of where to turn to for help. I do not fault current leadership
for resting because at times It is unavoidable. However, when the leader
is awake steps should be made to ensure that Gaudiguch continues to
thrive and grow. This is one of the many issues that I wish to rectify.
For those of you not familiar with me, I am an avid combatant and
defender of our city. Currently I hold the positions of Protector and
Undersecretary in the Illuminati, our city's most active guild. Those
that do know me know I am both ambitious and efficient. Both of my
grandparents our members of our Freedom council, maintaining guildmaster
for both the Templars and Illuminati, so leadership is clearly in my
blood. Some may believe it's a political conspiracy that is causing me
to contest now. I ensure you all this is not the case. My utmost
priority is Gaudiguch, it's citizens, and our potential to grow beyond
the state it is in currently. If you ever have any questions feel free
to approach me as I am ever in your service.
Sincerely, Mystic Seneth Ama'rua

OH. Right. It's election time again.
...
Wait.
>> Both of my grandparents our members of our Freedom council, maintaining
guildmaster for both the Templars and Illuminati, so leadership is clearly in
my blood.
Might as well hide your declared intent to take over where everyone can see it, right? Anyways:

From: Rodngar Naresni
To : Everyone
Subj: Another few years, another few shams!
I was wondering when the family would take another crack at a takeover
in a city, after the travesty that happened in Celest - took longer than
I imagined, though, hm!
So, before I actually air my opinion like offensive-smelling laundry,
let me just go ahead and do what I usually do: read through somebody's
post again and ask if they seriously just wrote the things they do, give
them a chance to intelligently back out, and then inevitably watch them
refuse to because elections are obviously an all-in process of
tomfoolery.
Seneth, your first point in your post is incredibly vague. It is an
oft-used lie that people stand on in elections here, and let me tell you
now: it doesn't work. It is a foolish claim. Stagnation does grip this
city, but that stagnation is born of the apathy of the city. A Mayor
cannot force people to do anything in Gaudiguch. A Mayor can incentivize
strengthening the city, but Kalin already has tried that and it did not
work. The citizens lack direction because they come here to do so - this
city is a haven for the lack, unmotivated masses who want nothing more
than to leech off the golden standard of Freedom we once represented.
The Mayor is around every month for days at a time - just because he
doesn't make a huge amount of noise doesn't mean he doesn't exist. He
does what work he needs to do - which is sadly not much when the city's
position is to generally not care about anything in the Basin. You can
say all you like that 'people want villages' - but you need to PROVE IT
instead of telling baseless lies. If we wanted them bad enough, we'd
have them - people would take up arms and speak to denizens. We would
have gotten at least one. We haven't, because the city is a nest of
apathy and that cannot be changed ever. You could as easily teach a fish
to fly or a crow to swim than to try and force a large portion of this
city to do something.
Not only do I question your experience - being an undersecretary and
protector do not qualify you to make large, incredibly important
decisions for this city - but I also question your worth. What do you
have that Kalin does not? You are, to be quite frank, a twenty-year-old
no name who has done nothing as far as I can see. You contesting simply
lowers my opinion of you because, like Anyania, Dysolis, and many others
before you, you seem to simply like complaining. A good prospective
leader would try their very hardest to bring these problems to an end
before contesting, because a wise leader knows that elections create
political upheaval that this city does not need.
As for leadership 'being in your blood', I do not think it is. Your
grandfather is the guildmaster of the Templars simply based on majority
and happenstance of the Grandmistress being missing, and your
grandmother's performance as Cipher is nothing to truly organize parades
about. Quality leadership is not something you gain by blood - you gain
it through experience over decades. To even state that because you are a
member of a certain family that you would make a great leader is
absolutely deplorable and reminds me of the tainted, oppressive noble
houses of Magnagora - do you truly wish to come off as a person who owns
slaves and oppresses so-called peasants in the name of some invisible
superiority?
Once again, another contestant throws their name in without ANY claims
of substance. You can say this or that until you go blue in the face -
but until you tell me how you will get to the 'this or that', and why it
would work, and just how you intend to get it by this city.. you are
doing nothing but scribbling on paper.
Now, on to my opinions:
I knew that this would happen the moment I heard of the elections in the
Templar. By contesting to control the Templars and owning the Illuminati
by majority, the Ama'rua family has effectively made it impossible to
oppose them if they truly wished to run the city right now if by nothing
but standard process of majority on the Freedom Council. This is clearly
a thinly-veiled plot of conspiracy to take over the City of Freedom - a
sickening act and aim. Those of you who would willingly participate in
this foolish play of power, know this: you are no better than the tyrant
you accused Kalin of being.
Honestly though, who here is honestly surprised? We've watched the
guilds change hands in leadership. The members of two of our three
guilds have dug our graves for us - even if this election ends in Kalin
Disanti retaining his position, it will not matter. The family is
capable by sheer majority on the Freedom Council (the only group of
power that matters in this city) of changing anything in this city if
they persist long enough. In truth, we are doing nothing but sitting and
waiting for them to give it a shot. The Freedom that our city was
founded on and seeks to preserve within her walls, on her streets, in
every market stall and office and home of great Gaudiguch is now at
stake. By handing over power to another member of this scheming family,
we face all-out tyranny. They will make our decisions for us, and we
will have no say. In the end, citizens, we are facing a legion of
mindlessly and aggressively adopted children who will put their faith
and weight, unsupported by their non-existant wisdom, behind every
little thing asked of them.
If the city of Gaudiguch elects Seneth, they will most assuredly lose
the true warriors of Freedom - as why would a soldier remain when there
is nothing left to fight for?

Subj: Mayoral election
Greetings, Gaudiguch! In light of the recent vacancy, I am adding my
name to the ballot for Mayor. Now, you're probably wondering, what does
Arix bring to the table? Well, to be perfectly honest, I'm not a
fighter, and I don't have family members in important city positions, so
if that's all you want you will be disappointed. I do have some
experience dealing with people, that tends to happen when you're old as
dirt. I am also willing to listen to the ideas people have and accept
constructive criticism. If anyone has any questions, just talk to me
later and I will try and answer them. Good luck to whoever else decides
to run!

(Gaudiguch): Erane says, "Hm.. I revoke my nay and instead say we should just
unenemy him and wait until he does something reeeally really stupid then
re-enemy him!"
(Gaudiguch): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Anyone counting here?"
(Gaudiguch): You say, "Let me see."
(Gaudiguch): Aliod says, "You children have fun, this hurts my head."
(Gaudiguch): Nataely says, "It shouldnt matter, not everyones here to vote nor
would have the chance to."
(Gaudiguch): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Oh hey now. This is what
everyone agreed to, isn't it?"
(Gaudiguch): Lyria (from the Aetherways) says, "Along with a load of bickering
and who's got more authority."
(Gaudiguch): You say, "6 aye's, 4 nay's it seems."
(Gaudiguch): Akui says, "Sounds like a whole mess of tyranny to me! In to the
volcano with the lot of them!"
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "8 ayes."
(Gaudiguch): You say, "Oh, yes, we really should make use of that volcano."
2010/11/02 02:22:54 - Aleria declared Kalin to be a formal enemy. Reason: clear
abuse of power and disrespect.
2010/11/02 02:24:17 - Rodngar declared that Kalin is no longer an enemy.
Reason: His abuse of power does not merit the enemy status, or else Aleria and
Relk would be attacked on sight!
2010/11/02 02:25:54 - Aleria declared Kalin to be a formal enemy. Reason: for
clear abuse of power and disrespect.
2010/11/02 02:26:20 - Rodngar declared that Kalin is no longer an enemy.
Reason: Once more, his disrespect and abuses of power are next to non-existant.

clear abuse of power and disrespect.
2010/11/02 02:27:29 - Rodngar declared that Kalin is no longer an enemy.
Reason: How did this get here?
2010/11/02 02:27:40 - Aleria declared Kalin to be a formal enemy. Reason: for
clear abuse of power and disrespect.
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Rodngar it was voted on."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Till referendum."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Dont push the issue."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "I will push it as I wish."
2010/11/02 02:28:04 - Rodngar declared that Kalin is no longer an enemy.
Reason: Hm, will just keep this up then.
2010/11/02 02:28:26 - Aleria voted to uncitizen Rodngar.
2010/11/02 02:29:18 - Relk voted to uncitizen Rodngar.
2010/11/02 02:29:37 - Aliod quit the city.
(Gaudiguch): Akui says, "See now, all governments are rotten! All aristocracies
are inevitably rule by mob! Our current mayor is the best that could be had,
for nobody has been as free of petty tyrannies as nobody at all! Hail no-one,
may its rule be long and prosperous!"

Rodngar lays his hands upon the Eternal Flame. The air around him sparkles and
fills with a thrumming buzz.
Rodngar's skin flashes a wild and chaotic assortment of colours before settling
upon its natural tone.
A length of flame quivers and dies out, leaving behind only cinders.
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "Oh and rodngar you have a power debt you need to
make up."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "Nice try."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "It is funny to watch you grasp at any way to get at
me."
(Gaudiguch): Aleria says, "There is no try to it..everyone has to abide by
it..and 14 is not hard to replace at a 1 to 1 ratio."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "I am drawing now, Aleria."
(Gaudiguch): Rodngar says, "Are you honestly that dumb?"

|=======================================================================
/ /
/ MAYOR ABANDONS CITY /
/ IN FIT OF RAGE /
/ /
/ In a fit of anger, apparently about the constant contestations /
/ and accusations against his person and his Mayorship, Kalin Disati /
/ not only resigned as Mayor, but renounced his citizenship as well! /
/ Rumours have been flying that Kalin plans to retire, that he plans to/
/ join Hallifax, and even that he claims to raise an army and retake /
/ his throne by force! All of these, or none of these may be true! We /
/ can only hope that these are mere exaggerations and that democracy /
/ and Freedom will triumph in Gaudiguch! FOR FREEDOM!!! /
/ /
/ /
/ SENETH VS ARIX /
/ ROUND ONE /
/ /
/ It's Election Season again, good readers! With the incumbent /
/ having left Gaudiguch in what some claim to be disappointment and /
/ what some claim to be mere petulance, we're left with two declared /
/ candidates already:Seneth Ama'rua and Arix Carthen. Seneth started up/
/ with accusations of stagnation, governmental negligence and a lack of/
/ direction for the city as a whole, but he'll be having a hard time of/
/ it with the accusations of nepotism and worse being slung like mud at/
/ a geomancer's birthday party! Arix Carthen, on the other hand, seems /
/ to be running on a short ticket, having not made any major promises /
/ about his term to date. More coverage of the election will follow! /
/ /
/ /
/ SHOPS UP FOR SALE /
/ TO PUBLIC /
/ /
/ With all the oustings, leavings, and other chaos in the city, /
/ a number of important shops have been left unguarded and unowned! /
/While the Chancellor has, thus far, prevented the city from descending/
/ into rioting and looting of these shops, she's announced that she /
/ wants to get them sold to citizens as soon as possible. Current cost /
/ is a dirt cheap 80,000 gold a piece! Send messages and money to Aoife/
/ to claim one of these for yourself before it's too late! /
/ /
/ /
/ RODNGAR NARESNI ACCUSES /
/ AMA'RUA OF TYRANNY ETC. /
/ /
/ Upon hearing about the recent contestation for the fine office /
/ of the Mayor of Gaudiguch, Rodngar's out ranting again! This time, he/
/ has a bone to pick with Seneth and the rest of the Ama'rua family, /
/ saying that these elections are "an all-in process of tomfoolery", /
/ that he question's Seneth's experience and qualifications, and went /
/ on to compare Seneth, and his family, to "the tainted, oppressive /
/ noble houses of Magnagora"! He further goes on to claim that the /
/ whole Ama'rua family is part of "a thinly-veiled plot of conspiracy /
/ to take over the City of Freedom" and to place Ama'rua family members/
/ on every seat of the Freedom Council! CONSPIRACY! SLANDER! NEPOTISM!!/
/ /
/======================================================================/
/ /
/ WORDS OF THE WISE MASTERS /
/ /
/ Remember the reclusive reveller who wished to eat rocks instead of /
/ food. This reveller smoked much okorushi blend, seeking enlightenment/
/ Rumour tells, the reveller bought the cold-hearted lucidian and so /
/ his third eye was opened. /
/ /
/ -The Venerable Masasachi Dith /
/ /
/ You heard it here, folks! Let us contemplate the /
/ reclusive reveller! /
/ /
/ /
/=======================================================================
/ /
/ SHOP SPONSORSHIPS /
/ /
/ [[Various shop ads utterly cram the bottom of this pamphlet, /
/ containing various advertisements for shops such as the /
/ Flaming Quill and A Ruby in the Rough. Two large ads, both /
/ from the Chancellor declaring that the Enlightened Master and /
/ The Crimson Eye are both for sale at 80,000 gold.]] /

(The Jackal's Wardrobe): Revan says, "I miss lack of rants."
(so do I :&lt; )
Lyria ceremoniously taps Rodngar with the Medallion of the High Flame,
bestowing upon him the guild's highest honour.
Rodngar Naresni says, "I am honored. Thank you, Archmage."
2010/11/02 03:05:37 - Lyria honoured Rodngar for: For his efforts to aid the
Pyromancers not once but twice, and for standing up for his convictions and
freedom in the face of adversity as a proper Hand of the Inferno.
~~~
Metamorphic Mortexia Dekoven says, "Just vote for whoever you feel would do the
best, that's all I ask."
Rodngar Naresni says to Mortexia, "I'll vote for the one that doesn't belong to
the corrupted, city-tampering family."

(No post text. Kalin Clique = Mexican.)
Supreme Paragon Ayden Dawneye, the Transformed says to Rodngar, "You are the
one abusing your power."
Rodngar Naresni says to Ayden, "Not precisely, just righting wrongs."
Supreme Paragon Ayden Dawneye, the Transformed says, "Kalin tried to kick me
out the month after i joined..."
Rodngar Naresni says to Ayden, "Probably for a valid relong."
You say, "... relong?"
Rodngar Naresni says, "Relong."
Rodngar nods his head at himself.
Rodngar Naresni says to you, "You donb't remember that lost language we found
in the pyramid?"
Rodngar gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.
Comprehension flashes across your face.
You say, "Right."
Rodngar Naresni says to Ayden, "He likely tried for a good reason."
Supreme Paragon Ayden Dawneye, the Transformed says, "Yeah, right."
Supreme Paragon Ayden Dawneye, the Transformed says, "I did nothing wrong."
You say, ".. yeah?"
Rodngar Naresni says to Ayden, "Yeah, and?"
You say, "Like twenty years prior."
Supreme Paragon Ayden Dawneye, the Transformed says, "You are a damn hypocrite."
Rodngar Naresni says, "You, unlike myself, proved nothing about your character."
Rodngar Naresni says, "You don't remember the Senator telling me I was better
suited to be here?"
Rodngar's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Supreme Paragon Ayden Dawneye, the Transformed says to Rodngar, "You are a
powerhungry little bitch."
Rodngar Naresni says to Ayden, "I'm none of those, though."
Rodngar Naresni says, "Though, them's fightin' words."
Supreme Paragon Ayden Dawneye, the Transformed says to Rodngar, "Going from
city to city snagging Champoin positions."
Rodngar Naresni says to Ayden, "Nah, just from Hallifax to Gaudiguch and then I
took three positions rightfully."
Ayden says, "Pssshhhh..."
A panoply of swirling, multicoloured lights twist about and envelop Ayden
before lancing off to the east.
&lt;&lt; That was the last of anything interesting. tl;dr summary?
Aleria has been jumping every newbie out of the portal in Gaudiguch to induct them into her family.
A combined factor of every member of The Kalin Clique(tm) going inactive at the same time for various reasons lead to Aleria Ama'rua become GM of the Illuminati. Rodngar gets kicked out of GC first (the election was between Eltorinus Ama'rua and Ayden) and then Xypher loses GA despite being active (to Briaria).
Relk Ama'rua takes over GM of the Paladins, and then Detho (3 guesses as to surname) takes GA. None of the Templars can fight so nobody contests Aliod, though this didn't stop anyone in the Illuminati from trying, clearly.
With Gaudiguch inebriating itself on Keeno McFluffins the Chaos Panda, the Pyromancers are the last guild to 'hold out'. Other conspiratory tidbits edited out of the logs, should they come to fruition in the future. >></div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+5 points with 5 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/badf4f6492264c0d7f1d720fb1c0dd17?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by saage.lust@xxx on 02Â Nov 2010</p>Every realm has its own zoo &ndash; guess that this one is Gaudiguch.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb8831312d001f276392ca77560b7b08?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by loocodnom@xxx on 02Â Nov 2010</p>What do you expect from the equivalent of Antioch and Ashtan?</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b981780c1b8d2817deb6fd4d4adb445?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by okwchief@xxx on 02Â Nov 2010</p>I always wondered why people voted Rodngar for champion, I&rsquo;ve never seen him participate in anything fight-related.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/609c4d7ad3315cc8d4dcf0ea9dbec3ed?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by vathael@xxx on 03Â Nov 2010</p>He does it for the honours lines I&rsquo;m sure.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/609c4d7ad3315cc8d4dcf0ea9dbec3ed?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by vathael@xxx on 03Â Nov 2010</p><p>He bears the Pyromancers Honour of the Mark of the Enlightened Flame.
