Feyr slings a manna rune and an othala rune at you, hitting you in the chest.
You feel the trust placed in you by others slip away.
You are afflicted with an unknown affliction.
Feyr points a crooked finger at you, croaking again the foretelling of your doom. Pain suddenly
wracks your heart as the weave of Fate twists tight around your heart and it abruptly stops. You
fall to the ground dead at Feyr's feet just as he has prophesied, his cruel cackling the last sound
you hear.
You have been slain by Feyr.
