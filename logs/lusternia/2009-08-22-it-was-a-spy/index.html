Aithne then announced over the aether that I was consorting with commune enemies."

Ilona Starfall says, "I&#39;ve heard reports from my friends that she&#39;s been harrassing them as well, and I was just at Mother a little while ago, and she says "want to see a trick?" Then she goes and slices my baby in half, and calls me abnormal and insane."

Ilona Starfall says, "That&#39;s the summarized version."

Priestess Sarrasri Talnara, Arrow of the Hunt says, "Unsummarize it, please."

Priestess Sarrasri Talnara, Arrow of the Hunt says, "Details are important."

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says, "I&#39;d like to state that Ilona is actually not a trill. She&#39;s a human that has trill wings."

Priestess Sarrasri Talnara, Arrow of the Hunt says to Aithne, "I said to not interrupt, didn&#39;t I?"

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says, "Well, I technically didn&#39;t."

Ilona Starfall says, "Well, ma&#39;am that&#39;s all there is to it, for my portion of my story. If you want details on how she harrassed my friends, then you&#39;d have to ask Meae for her story."

Ilona Starfall says, "Anything more detailed really would be insults and such."

Priestess Sarrasri Talnara, Arrow of the Hunt says, "Alright."

Priestess Sarrasri Talnara, Arrow of the Hunt says to Aithne, "Alright, you can speak now. What do you have to say about this?"

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says, "Ilona&#39;s accusations of insults and harassment are baseless and stem from a desire for vengeance for my perfectly valid and reasonable actions to keep her and other Serenwilders safe and in line."

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says to Sarrasri, "That baby, simply put, was an outsider. It was not a citizen of Serenwilde, and it&#39;s presence at the Moonhart Mother Tree insinuated that it had an ulterior motive."

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says to Sarrasri, "CHELP LEAVES clearly states that outsiders are not permitted to spy upon commune members. The baby was a spy."

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says, "It&#39;s a shame that it&#39;s cut in half, though, so I can&#39;t really prove that it was a spy. But you have my word and my honour as a Serenguard."

Priestess Sarrasri Talnara, Arrow of the Hunt says, "...okay then."

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says to Sarrasri, "As a Serenguard I am charged with protecting the forest of Serenwilde and it&#39;s people from all that might harm it. I sized up the baby as a suitable threat. As an outsider, it had guest priviliges, but these are revoked if it refuses to leave when asked."

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says to Sarrasri, "I sent the baby a tell, telling it to leave the Serenwilde, and it declined. So, I slew it, under suspicion if it being a spy."

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says to Sarrasri, "About Ilona. She claims she is a trill. I decline to agree. She is a human with trill wings. No trill, whatsoever, has hair. They grow feathers on their head - do you see any feathers on Ilona&#39;s head?"

Serenguard Aithne, Fire Warrior says to Sarrasri, "Apparently she takes offense to me debunking her false claims, and thus seeks to insult and harass me in whichever way possible. Including making claims I insult and harass her."'>Ilona Starfall says, "Since I first met Aithne, she has been insulting me and harrassing me, and trying to tell me what to do.
