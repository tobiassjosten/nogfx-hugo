02:16:17a | rear and solidly strike Naggerguy with a hoof.
02:16:17a | Naggerguy has been slain by a cavalier of the Light.

 You tell Doman Trueflight, Symphonic Visionary, "Not the first time she has been caught in there using the place for an inn."

 Doman tells you, "I find out you killed someone in here again, The status will remain."
