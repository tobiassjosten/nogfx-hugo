Passing a spiralling tower. (Cay of Cloadahi)
There is a maelstrom of rainbow colours whipping violently around. The corrosiveness of the taint 
sickens the land. A few light wisps of cloud are spread high in the sky. There are 3 luminous purple 
spined starfish here. There are 2 chitinous crimson crabs here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here.
 Alpha-Sohei Xaldrin Somnius, Heir of the North is here, shrouded. He wields an emerald chain with 
both hands. Brother Tenebrus n'Kylbar, Scion of Creeping Shadows is here. He wields a sinuous jakari 
of blackened steel with both hands. Archmage Xazlael Somnius is here. He wields a silver jeweler's 
hammer in his left hand and a twisted staff in his right. Chainreaver Kalas Kaikazu is here, 
shrouded. He wields a long black chain with steel scythes with both hands. Kyoodai Ethelon a'Ishial, 
Apprentice of the Way is here, shrouded. He wields a ghostly angelbone chain with both hands.

sickens the land. A fresh gale whistles in your ears. A grand, spiralling tower rises to the east, 
pristine white marble exquisitely carved and shaped to ascend high above the main structure of the 
ruins. Against its base, lush greenery has sprung forth low to the ground, obscuring the sand 
beneath in a gentle spray of curling leaves and tangled vines. Long slivers of marble lie on the 
sand nearby, remnants from a once-grand embellishment above. There are 3 luminous purple spined 
starfish here. A chitinous crimson crab scuttles about here, claws clicking. A stinking noxious 
cloud floats here. Chainreaver Kalas Kaikazu is here, shrouded. He wields a long black chain with

beneath in a gentle spray of curling leaves and tangled vines. Long slivers of marble lie on the
sand nearby, remnants from a once-grand embellishment above. There are 3 luminous purple spined
starfish here. A chitinous crimson crab scuttles about here, claws clicking. A stinking noxious
cloud floats here. Chainreaver Kalas Kaikazu is here, shrouded. He wields a long black chain with
steel scythes with both hands. Alpha-Sohei Xaldrin Somnius, Heir of the North is here, shrouded. He

There is a maelstrom of rainbow colours whipping violently around. The corrosiveness of the taint
sickens the land. It is quite mild. A grand, spiralling tower rises to the east, pristine white
marble exquisitely carved and shaped to ascend high above the main structure of the ruins. Against
its base, lush greenery has sprung forth low to the ground, obscuring the sand beneath in a gentle
spray of curling leaves and tangled vines. Long slivers of marble lie on the sand nearby, remnants
from a once-grand embellishment above. There are 3 luminous purple spined starfish here. A chitinous
crimson crab scuttles about here, claws clicking. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. There are 2
sparkleberries in 2 groups here. A bunch of pennyroyal lies on the ground. The twisted remains of
Xazlael lie here. Merciful Judge Saoirse Val'Andra lingers here, bursts of multicoloured light
randomly exploding in and out of existence around her. She wields a radiant symbol of love in her
left hand. Red Hand Alacardael waits here, skeins of resinous smoke curling languidly about his
figure in flickering, coppery tongues of light and shadow. He wields Gauntlets of Transformation in
his left hand and a metal treebark shield in his right.

The light of Holy Celestia surrounds you as the blessed Supernals judge the unworthy.
A chitinous crimson crab vanishes beneath the sand. Abruptly, a searing pain flares at the bottom of
your foot. A swift kick sends a chitinous crimson crab flying across the sand as the wound throbs
painfully.
You twist aside, deflecting part of the attack.

Passing a spiralling tower. (Cay of Cloadahi)
There is a maelstrom of rainbow colours whipping violently around. The corrosiveness of the taint
sickens the land. A fresh gale whistles in your ears. A grand, spiralling tower rises to the east,
pristine white marble exquisitely carved and shaped to ascend high above the main structure of the
ruins. Against its base, lush greenery has sprung forth low to the ground, obscuring the sand
beneath in a gentle spray of curling leaves and tangled vines. Long slivers of marble lie on the
sand nearby, remnants from a once-grand embellishment above. There are 3 luminous purple spined
starfish here. A chitinous crimson crab scuttles about here, claws clicking. A stinking noxious
cloud floats here. There are 2 sparkleberries in 2 groups here. A bunch of pennyroyal lies on the
ground. Red Hand Alacardael waits here, skeins of resinous smoke curling languidly about his figure
in flickering, coppery tongues of light and shadow. He wields Gauntlets of Transformation in his
left hand and a metal treebark shield in his right. Merciful Judge Saoirse Val'Andra lingers here,
bursts of multicoloured light randomly exploding in and out of existence around her. She wields a
radiant symbol of love in her left hand.
You see exits leading north and west.
