Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (road). (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Praise and vocal supplication to the Crown of the Exalted whisper past you, echoing from a shield shrine of Eventru nearby. This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (road). (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The inside of this small cottage is actually somewhat friendlier than the bleak exterior would suggest, but no less dilapidated. The wooden floorboards are worn, with splinters around the edges, whilst the stone walls are missing small pieces. The ceiling overhead, once painted white, is now filled with small cracks across each of the wooden boards. Despite this, the room is fairly tidy, a coat-stand by the pinewood door holding several jackets and a large chest on the other side open and filled with clothes and linen. Sounds of a roaring fire crackle from the north, whilst it is possible to see a small kitchen to the west. A small table by the kitchen door allows a vase of dying flowers to be displayed for all visitors. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A mutated mutt crawls along the floor here. A philosopher's stone rests on the ground, gleaming with power.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. A pile of rubble lies here, blocking the way northeast.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. A pile of rubble lies here, blocking the way northeast. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A pile of rubble lies here, blocking the way northeast. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, marred by a black miasma. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, marred by a black miasma.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, marred by a black miasma. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (road). (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The inside of this small cottage is actually somewhat friendlier than the bleak exterior would suggest, but no less dilapidated. The wooden floorboards are worn, with splinters around the edges, whilst the stone walls are missing small pieces. The ceiling overhead, once painted white, is now filled with small cracks across each of the wooden boards. Despite this, the room is fairly tidy, a coat-stand by the pinewood door holding several jackets and a large chest on the other side open and filled with clothes and linen. Sounds of a roaring fire crackle from the north, whilst it is possible to see a small kitchen to the west. A small table by the kitchen door allows a vase of dying flowers to be displayed for all visitors. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A mutated mutt crawls along the floor here. A philosopher's stone rests on the ground, gleaming with power.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey.

A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

You and your friends look at each other, dismayed that the stranger has brought such sorrow to your revelry.

His grim face turns down to you, and he says in a low voice, "It is time."

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields a golden sunburst shield in her right hand.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded.

Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, marred by a black miasma. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, marred by a black miasma. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

You begin to chant the words of vile darkness, and an iron cross rises up from the ground before Alianna. Vicious spikes slam into her flesh and nail her to the cross. She screams in pain and agony as blood is splattered in all directions.
[[ You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns! ]]
[[ You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold! ]]
