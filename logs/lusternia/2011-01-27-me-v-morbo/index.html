Smoke curling from her nostrils, a midnight black nightmare paws impatiently at the black clouds roiling beneath her hooves. Morbo is here, sprawled on the ground.

You see exits leading northeast, south, and west.
4704h, 6516m, 6516e, 10p, 17048en, 9695w exkdb-<\ br>You raise your arms and hum deeply the note of the forest. Around you, the taint seeps out of the trees and plant life, which start to look greener and healthier than before.

A viciously thorned vine spears out from a nearby branch and lashes tightly around Morbo&#39;s left leg.

Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky. The air is dry and hot, drifting slowly among the large rocks that cover the fields. The fields are muddy and slippery here at the bank of the Seres. Smoke curling from her nostrils, a midnight black nightmare paws impatiently at the black clouds roiling beneath her hooves. Morbo is here. He wields an emerald temporal resonator in his left hand and a glacial platinum tower shield in his right. Orbiting around his head are several spinning crystals.

Smoke curling from her nostrils, a midnight black nightmare paws impatiently at the black clouds roiling beneath her hooves. Morbo is here, sprawled on the ground.

The fields are muddy and slippery here at the bank of the Seres. Smoke curling from her nostrils, a midnight black nightmare paws impatiently at the black clouds roiling beneath her hooves.
