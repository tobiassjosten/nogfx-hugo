400/429H 350/429M - out

Outside the doctor&#39;s office.
This space is roughly triangular in shape, seeming more of a junction of the two
opposing hallways than a proper room. Short metal benches are bolted to the 
metal floor, their grey exterior blending into the walls. Covering everything is
a film of dirt, brown and black. A door sits in the eastern wall, a poorly 
attached slat of metal labelled "Doctor" hanging in its middle. The filth seems 
to grow thicker as it nears the southwestern hall, a dimly lit passage of tight 
walls. Northwest the surfaces have the vague impression of cleanliness, though 
by comparison only.
A burly guard stands here. The ship captain stands here, demanding respect.
You see exits leading to the southwest, northwest and in.
400/429H 350/429M - 
The guard says to the captain, "I understand sir, I&#39;ll bring this prisoner back 
to the cells immediately."
400/429H 350/429M - 
You step beside the guard, who turns toward the cramped hallway. Behind you 
there is the earsplitting sound of metal being torn apart. The guard spins 
about, weapon suddenly in hand. Turning back, you can make out, through the 
thick smoke, a human in heavy armour.
400/429H 350/429M - 
The heavily armoured human rushes toward you. You fall to the side, against the 
wall, as a dagger flashes in the human&#39;s hand. The guard gives a grunt cut short
by a gurgle, blood flowing from a wide gash in his throat. The slaver captain 
rushes into the sitting room from another hallway. The armoured human turns 
toward the captain, dagger pointed straight for his heart.
400/429H 350/429M - 
The Captain screams, "Help me and I will grant you your freedom."

As you ponder the captain&#39;s offer the warrior moves in to engage the captain.
400/429H 350/429M - 
[HINT: At this time you may either assist the captain by typing ENGAGE WARRIOR 
to engage the warrior in melee combat, or, if you do not wish to take the 
captain&#39;s offer, instead attempting an escape on your own, simply sit back and 
watch the captain die.]
400/429H 350/429M - engage warrior

You engage the warrior in melee combat.
400/429H 350/429M - 
The Captain shouts, "Yes, now kick that vile warrior to death!"
400/429H 350/429M - 
You have recovered balance on all of your limbs.
400/429H 350/429M - 
[HINT: To attack the warrior, you must either KICK WARRIOR or PUNCH WARRIOR. 
Doing so will take your physical balance, which you will regain in a few 
seconds. While you are off balance you cannot do another action such as kick or 
punch.]

As you increase in levels your maximum health and mental points will increase. 
You will also gain lessons that will be used later to learn skills and 
abilities.
508/508H 508/508M -

508/508H 508/508M - 
508/508H 508/508M - 
The Captain says, "You, 174, go get my pistol from my quarters."

Outside the doctor&#39;s office.
The bloody corpse of a guard lies here, blood pooling on the floor.  Having been
bested, a heavily armoured human lies on the ground. The Captain is here, 
demanding respect.
You see exits leading to the southwest, northwest and in.
508/508H 508/508M - nw

A hallway in the ship.
Brown filth darkens the cold grey metal that composes every surface of this 
hallway. The passage is wide enough to be comfortable, its ceiling high. 
Yellowed lights cast a dim, steady glow about the hall. To the southeast it 
opens to a wide room, benches against the walls. Westward begins a curve 
southward, a door standing in the northern bend.
You see exits leading to the southeast and west.
508/508H 508/508M - w

You proceed to the hallway just before the Captain&#39;s quarters.
Outside the Captain&#39;s quarters.
A small red carpet, its edges frayed and its colours fading, lies on the floor 
before a door in whose face is etched the word "Captain." Cold grey metal 
comprises every visible surface, door included. Covering the metal is a thick 
film of dirt and grime, browns and greens mixing to a black, the worst of the 
filth growing in the corners. To the east is a hallway, turning southward. The 
walls to the west bend south, where again they turn, westward.
You see exits leading to the north(closed door)(open door), east and southwest.
508/508H 508/508M - open door north

You open the door to the north.
508/508H 508/508M - n

The Captain&#39;s quarters.
The floor here is covered in a plush carpet of a vibrant red, decorated in 
swirls of gold and silver. On the walls are hung drapes of silk and tapestries 
depicting quiet images of farming and animal husbandry. The room is spacious, 
the ceiling high, an ornate chandelier of glimmering crystal hanging from its 
centre. Against the western wall stands a tall bed, a lace-edged canopy hanging 
above it. Thick blankets of silk cover the bed, a plethora of pillows at its 
head. Across from the bed, standing some distance from the eastern wall, is a 
desk of dark wood, lighter whorls patterned across its surface; a chair of 
similar wood sits against the wall. Atop the desk is spread open a heavy book, 
numbers and names scrawled neatly within it. Running along the northern wall is 
a long cupboard of a lighter wood, dials on the left side of every door. A door,
revealing the cold grey metal of the rest of the ship, sits in the southern 
wall.
A compact phaser lies here in danger of getting damaged.
There is a single exit here to the south(open door).
508/508H 508/508M - get phaser

You get a compact phaser.
508/508H 508/508M - 
The Captain tells you, "Bring me the phaser, I&#39;m on the bridge. Just follow the 
path to the west and you should find it."

508/508H 508/508M - sw

A hallway in the ship.
The hallway is a square tube of cold, grey metal. Patterns of brown filth and 
black dirt cover every surface, clumping together in the corners. The light in 
the ceiling above is dim and yellow, its glow dull. The hallway extends 
northward, where lies a frayed red carpet before a single door, and west, to a 
wide, circular space.
You see exits leading to the northeast and west.
508/508H 508/508M - w

You proceed to the hallway just before the bridge.
Between the Bridge and the Transport Room.
This space is wide, a polygon shaped by archways marking the entry into new 
rooms north and south, and a hallway to the east. Metal, cold and grey, makes up
the many surfaces, coated with brownish filth. In the corners and along the 
edges, the filth grows thickest, blacks and greens prevalent. The centre of the 
floor is scuffed and scratched, evidence of much travel. The archways are 
composed of straight lines and sharp angles, wider than they are tall. To the 
northwest can be seen the Bridge, home to computers and chairs and a wide view 
of the outside. Eastward is visible a hallway running away northeast. And, to 
the south, stands the wide, flat platform of the Transporter.
You see exits leading to the east, southeast, south and northwest.
508/508H 508/508M - nw

You proceed onto the bridge.
The Bridge.
The entirety of the bridge&#39;s northwestern wall is an open view of the space 
outside. Arrayed equally before that window, in a loose triangle, are three 
consoles, each containing a myriad of buttons, lights, and computer screens. 
Heavy chairs sit before those consoles. Set back, equidistant between the outer 
chairs, and directly between the foremost chair and the archway to the hall 
southeast, is a wider console, set atop a raised dais, containing many more 
buttons, lights, and screens. Behind this console, too, is a heavy chair. The 
walls surrounding the window are composed of the same grey metal as the floor 
and ceiling.
The ship captain stands here, demanding respect.
There is a single exit here to the southeast.
508/508H 508/508M - 
The Captain says to the helmsman, "I&#39;m sure of it, and a touched will net us a 
hefty fee."
508/508H 508/508M - 
The Captain notices your entrance and turns to face you.
508/508H 508/508M - 
The Captain says to you, "Great, now give me the phaser in case there&#39;s any more
of those raiders left."
508/508H 508/508M - 
[HINT: To give items to another player or denizen (non-player character), enter 
GIVE <item> TO <player>. To give the phaser to the Captain, you should use GIVE

587/587H 587/587M - 
The Captain says to you, "Thank you. Now, do you remember where you were 
originally headed? Perhaps the Bileath Corporate Empire, Trekat Empire or the 
Jezira Empire?"
587/587H 587/587M - 
(Newbie): Zuri says, "I can&#39;t seem to find that mechanic. I&#39;m at the NW part of

The Captain says to you, "If you are not sure, just say the name of the empire 
and I&#39;ll help you remember them."
587/587H 587/587M -

the name of the empire and I&#39;ll gladly drop you off at their training grounds. 
For example, if you wish to go to the Trekat Empire, then say take me to Trekat
."

You say, "Jezira."
587/587H 587/587M - 
The Captain says, "Named after their greatest leader, Izarin Jezira, a man of 
great mental abilities. They, mainly through their deals with the Delinoth, are 
responsible for the destruction of the long gone Velkin Empire and have proven 
themselves to be both formidable and intriguing opponents."

The Captain says, "Ah, Bileath Corporate Empire an empire after my own heart. 
Centered around the Delinoth homeworld of Caane, here the Delinoth built a great
trading corporation that has grown so large it can no longer be called just a 
corporation. Money rules above all else here. If this is where you are going 
then I hope you have a large bank account."
587/587H 587/587M - say trekat

[HINT: To ask the Captain about the different Empires, simply SAY the Empire&#39;s 
name. For example, SAY Bileath or SAY Trekat or SAY Jezira. Once you have 
selected the Empire you wish to be part of, SAY TAKE ME TO  and the Empire&#39;s 
name - for example, SAY TAKE ME TO Bileath or SAY TAKE ME TO Trekat or SAY TAKE 
ME TO Jezira.]
587/587H 587/587M - 
You say, "Trekat."
587/587H 587/587M - 
The Captain says, "The Gemadak built the Trekat Empire after the confines of 
their homeworld, Kantah, could no longer fulfill their need for growth and 
expansion. Of course, being the weak things they are, the Gemadak could not 
handle the hard labour of building new settlements, so they turned to my 
favourite method, slavery. Those days are gone, for the most part. Now they 
spend most of their time trying to stop their own greatest creation, the 
Singularity."

The Bridge.
The entirety of the bridge&#39;s northwestern wall is an open view of the space 
outside. Arrayed equally before that window, in a loose triangle, are three 
consoles, each containing a myriad of buttons, lights, and computer screens. 
Heavy chairs sit before those consoles. Set back, equidistant between the outer 
chairs, and directly between the foremost chair and the archway to the hall 
southeast, is a wider console, set atop a raised dais, containing many more 
buttons, lights, and screens. Behind this console, too, is a heavy chair. The 
walls surrounding the window are composed of the same grey metal as the floor 
and ceiling.
The ship captain stands here, demanding respect.
There is a single exit here to the southeast.

Between the Bridge and the Transport Room.
This space is wide, a polygon shaped by archways marking the entry into new 
rooms north and south, and a hallway to the east. Metal, cold and grey, makes up
the many surfaces, coated with brownish filth. In the corners and along the 
edges, the filth grows thickest, blacks and greens prevalent. The centre of the 
floor is scuffed and scratched, evidence of much travel. The archways are 
composed of straight lines and sharp angles, wider than they are tall. To the 
northwest can be seen the Bridge, home to computers and chairs and a wide view 
of the outside. Eastward is visible a hallway running away northeast. And, to 
the south, stands the wide, flat platform of the Transporter.
You see exits leading to the east, southeast, south and northwest.

The Transporter Room.
Dominating the entirety of this room is a wide, flat surface, smooth and clean. 
The ceiling, too, is made of the same smooth, shiny material. A short step leads
to the platform, a computer console raised to waist height beside it. The 
console stretches around the outside of the platform, multiple monitors in its 
face. An archway opens to the north into a wide hall.
There is a single exit here to the north.
587/587H 587/587M - 
[HINT: You can now beam down to the surface and continue the introduction.]
587/587H 587/587M - beam down

Every particle of your body is suddenly torn asunder as you teleport to the 
surface of Elar.
587/587H 587/587M - 
A muscular elar says, "Welcome, Aurulius, to the Elaran Training Grounds for the
newly found Touched of the Jezira Empire."
587/587H 587/587M - 
A muscular elar says, "I am Alkari and I will be your instructor until you are 
ready to continue on your own."
587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari says, "Here you will learn the basics of what it means to be a Touched in
the greatest empire in the galaxy. Your little adventure has given you a leg up 
on other trainees."
587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari hands you a standard issue bag and says, "Inside you will find the 
trainee shirt and pants, as well as some funds to get you started."
587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari says, "You should probe it to see what is inside."
587/587H 587/587M - 
[HINT: To look inside a container, you can PROBE the item. For example, PROBE 
BAG.]

~~~ If you need any help, enter HELP INTRO, or HINT for a quick hint. ~~~
587/587H 587/587M - probe bag

This bag is of a plain blue colour with large straps for carrying it on one&#39;s 
back. The name "Aurulius" is carefully etched on the side.
It appears to have one hundred twenty months of usefulness left.
It is holding:
a compact phaser, a loose-sleeved white shirt, a pair of grey denim pants
750 E-units.
587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari says, "As you can see, we&#39;ve given you a small amount of money - known as
Energy Units, or e-units for short - to get you started, a basic set of clothes 
to wear and a phaser."

[HINT: Energy Units, or e-units for short, is a form of currency in Tears of 
Polaris. They are solidified energy that can be later be converted back into 
pure energy with very little loss.]
587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari says, "You should get your pistol from your bag."
587/587H 587/587M - get pistol from bag

You get a compact phaser from a Jeziran-issue bag.
587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari says, "On the side of your weapon is a selector switch which has three 
settings blast, beam, and burst. In addition there is a setting for strength, 
between 1 and 100."

587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari says, "You should select blast at 50 on your pistol for this stage of 
your training."
587/587H 587/587M - 
[HINT: To change the settings of a phaser-based weapon, you use SELECT 
[BLAST|BEAM|BURST] <strength level> ON <weapon>. Each type of attack has its own
strengths and weaknesses, which you will learn more about during the course of 
the game. The higher you set your weapon&#39;s strength, the more damage it will do 
to your opponents, but the faster it will run out of power. At this stage in the
introduction, you should use SELECT BLAST 50 ON PISTOL to set your pistol to use
the blast ability at 50% strength.]
587/587H 587/587M - 
(Newbie): Zuri says, "Hrm I still can&#39;t find him."
587/587H 587/587M - select blast 50 on pistol

You select blast at 50%.
587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari says, "Once you have wielded your new pistol you must defeat me to 
complete your training."
587/587H 587/587M - 
[HINT: To wield a weapon you simply type WIELD <weapon>. So to wield your pistol
you need to use the command WIELD PISTOL.]
587/587H 587/587M - 
(Newbie): Krax says, "That quest is actually exceptionally frustrating and hard 
for a newbie."
587/587H 587/587M - wield pistol

You start wielding a compact phaser in your right hand.
587/587H 587/587M - 
You have recovered balance on all of your limbs.
587/587H 587/587M - 
Alkari says, "Good, now fire your weapon at me - if you best me, you will be 
ready for the next level."
587/587H 587/587M - 
You register the searing blue blast of energy from a compact phaser as it 
strikes your torso, Alkari behind the offending weapon.
523/587H 587/587M - 
[HINT: Firing your pistol at enemies is as simple as typing FIRE AT <target>. As
you learn more about phaser weapons you will learn different techniques for more
effective targeting and killing of your enemies. To complete your training you 
must defeat Alkari by using FIRE AT ALKARI until he is dead or surrenders.]

[TIP: Remember, you can adjust the speed of the introduction to your comfort 
level using the commands SPEEDUP and SLOWDOWN.

them while they last."

abstract leaves and thick, smoothly curving lines in an ever-repeating pattern. 
Tall, thin spires, topped with wide bulbs and sharp needles, sit at regular 
intervals along the walls. To the north the trees push up against solid mountain
wall, while to the south they stretch as if to the horizon. The walkway runs 
east, where it begins a southward curve, and west, to meet the flat face of a 
large white building.
You see exits leading to the east and west.

A bend in the walkway.
The walkway is built of pearlescent white adobe, set between thick beams of 
silver metal. Short walls of the same adobe line the walkway, an ever-repeating 
design of swirling leaves and thick, bold lines covering their surface. Along 
the top of the wall are tall spires, topped in wide bulbs that thin to sharp 
needles. Trees, wide and green, cloak the ground beneath the walkway, growing 
north to meet the mountain wall, and stretching south toward the horizon. The 
walkway turns to the southeast here, and runs westward toward the distance wall 
of a large building.
You see exits leading to the southeast and west.

Before a flight of stairs.
Rising from the north side of the wide walkway are stairs, climbing toward a 
wide square building set back against the walkway&#39;s outer edge. The ground floor
of the building is wide open, supported by four thick corner beams and enclosed 
by a porous lattice of arabesque design. Flowers and plants of all shapes and 
colours seek to spill from the lattice, their rainbow petals pushing through. 
Thick metal beams form the edges of the walkway as it continues east toward a 
steep ramp, and northwest toward a bend. Trees carpet the earth beneath the 
walkway, stretching away toward the mountain wall to the north; south they stop 
only at the skyline. In the far eastern distance can be made out the tops of 
shimmering white buildings.
You see exits leading to the northwest and up.

A landing before a shop.
A ceiling of pearlescent white adobe, radiant in various rainbow hues, covers 
the landing at the top of the stairs. Wide pillars of the same adobe support the
ceiling, a repeating pattern of abstract leaf and thick, gentle strokes, curled 
and complex, carved into their surface. To the east stands a bare wall with 
sliding doors in its centre. Westward, the stairs descend to meet a wide walkway
of adobe, girded by silver metal.
You see exits leading to the east and down.

Elaran Training Shop.
Display cases of thick, translucent glass line the walls of this large, square 
room. Standing within the cases are weapons of various kinds, from rifles and 
handguns to more mundane blades. Dull white lights illuminate the cases. Set 
before the eastern wall of displays is a wide counter, stretching the entire 
length of the room. In the southern wall, set between the many display cases, 
are tall windows, round at their peaks. Centred in the western wall is a sliding
door.
You can view what this shop has for sale using WARES.
There is a single exit here to the west.

400/429H 350/429M - out
Outside the doctor's office.
This space is roughly triangular in shape, seeming more of a junction of the two
opposing hallways than a proper room. Short metal benches are bolted to the
metal floor, their grey exterior blending into the walls. Covering everything is
a film of dirt, brown and black. A door sits in the eastern wall, a poorly
attached slat of metal labelled "Doctor" hanging in its middle. The filth seems
to grow thicker as it nears the southwestern hall, a dimly lit passage of tight
walls. Northwest the surfaces have the vague impression of cleanliness, though
by comparison only.
A burly guard stands here. The ship captain stands here, demanding respect.
You see exits leading to the southwest, northwest and in.
400/429H 350/429M -
The guard says to the captain, "I understand sir, I'll bring this prisoner back
to the cells immediately."
400/429H 350/429M -
You step beside the guard, who turns toward the cramped hallway. Behind you
there is the earsplitting sound of metal being torn apart. The guard spins
about, weapon suddenly in hand. Turning back, you can make out, through the
thick smoke, a human in heavy armour.
400/429H 350/429M -
The heavily armoured human rushes toward you. You fall to the side, against the
wall, as a dagger flashes in the human's hand. The guard gives a grunt cut short
by a gurgle, blood flowing from a wide gash in his throat. The slaver captain
rushes into the sitting room from another hallway. The armoured human turns
toward the captain, dagger pointed straight for his heart.
400/429H 350/429M -
The Captain screams, "Help me and I will grant you your freedom."
As you ponder the captain's offer the warrior moves in to engage the captain.
400/429H 350/429M -
[HINT: At this time you may either assist the captain by typing ENGAGE WARRIOR
to engage the warrior in melee combat, or, if you do not wish to take the
captain's offer, instead attempting an escape on your own, simply sit back and
watch the captain die.]
400/429H 350/429M - engage warrior
You engage the warrior in melee combat.
400/429H 350/429M -

400/429H 350/429M -
You have recovered balance on all of your limbs.
400/429H 350/429M -
[HINT: To attack the warrior, you must either KICK WARRIOR or PUNCH WARRIOR.
Doing so will take your physical balance, which you will regain in a few
seconds. While you are off balance you cannot do another action such as kick or
punch.]

Outside the doctor's office.
The bloody corpse of a guard lies here, blood pooling on the floor. Having been
bested, a heavily armoured human lies on the ground. The Captain is here,
demanding respect.
You see exits leading to the southwest, northwest and in.
508/508H 508/508M - nw
A hallway in the ship.
Brown filth darkens the cold grey metal that composes every surface of this
hallway. The passage is wide enough to be comfortable, its ceiling high.
Yellowed lights cast a dim, steady glow about the hall. To the southeast it
opens to a wide room, benches against the walls. Westward begins a curve
southward, a door standing in the northern bend.
You see exits leading to the southeast and west.
508/508H 508/508M - w
You proceed to the hallway just before the Captain's quarters.
Outside the Captain's quarters.
A small red carpet, its edges frayed and its colours fading, lies on the floor
before a door in whose face is etched the word "Captain." Cold grey metal
comprises every visible surface, door included. Covering the metal is a thick
film of dirt and grime, browns and greens mixing to a black, the worst of the
filth growing in the corners. To the east is a hallway, turning southward. The
walls to the west bend south, where again they turn, westward.
You see exits leading to the north(closed door)(open door), east and southwest.

The Captain's quarters.
The floor here is covered in a plush carpet of a vibrant red, decorated in
swirls of gold and silver. On the walls are hung drapes of silk and tapestries
depicting quiet images of farming and animal husbandry. The room is spacious,
the ceiling high, an ornate chandelier of glimmering crystal hanging from its
centre. Against the western wall stands a tall bed, a lace-edged canopy hanging
above it. Thick blankets of silk cover the bed, a plethora of pillows at its
head. Across from the bed, standing some distance from the eastern wall, is a
desk of dark wood, lighter whorls patterned across its surface; a chair of
similar wood sits against the wall. Atop the desk is spread open a heavy book,
numbers and names scrawled neatly within it. Running along the northern wall is
a long cupboard of a lighter wood, dials on the left side of every door. A door,
revealing the cold grey metal of the rest of the ship, sits in the southern
wall.
A compact phaser lies here in danger of getting damaged.
There is a single exit here to the south(open door).
508/508H 508/508M - get phaser
You get a compact phaser.
508/508H 508/508M -

A hallway in the ship.
The hallway is a square tube of cold, grey metal. Patterns of brown filth and
black dirt cover every surface, clumping together in the corners. The light in
the ceiling above is dim and yellow, its glow dull. The hallway extends
northward, where lies a frayed red carpet before a single door, and west, to a
wide, circular space.
You see exits leading to the northeast and west.
508/508H 508/508M - w
You proceed to the hallway just before the bridge.
Between the Bridge and the Transport Room.
This space is wide, a polygon shaped by archways marking the entry into new
rooms north and south, and a hallway to the east. Metal, cold and grey, makes up
the many surfaces, coated with brownish filth. In the corners and along the
edges, the filth grows thickest, blacks and greens prevalent. The centre of the
floor is scuffed and scratched, evidence of much travel. The archways are
composed of straight lines and sharp angles, wider than they are tall. To the
northwest can be seen the Bridge, home to computers and chairs and a wide view
of the outside. Eastward is visible a hallway running away northeast. And, to
the south, stands the wide, flat platform of the Transporter.
You see exits leading to the east, southeast, south and northwest.
508/508H 508/508M - nw
You proceed onto the bridge.
The Bridge.
The entirety of the bridge's northwestern wall is an open view of the space
outside. Arrayed equally before that window, in a loose triangle, are three
consoles, each containing a myriad of buttons, lights, and computer screens.
Heavy chairs sit before those consoles. Set back, equidistant between the outer
chairs, and directly between the foremost chair and the archway to the hall
southeast, is a wider console, set atop a raised dais, containing many more
buttons, lights, and screens. Behind this console, too, is a heavy chair. The
walls surrounding the window are composed of the same grey metal as the floor
and ceiling.
The ship captain stands here, demanding respect.
There is a single exit here to the southeast.

The Captain says, "The Gemadak built the Trekat Empire after the confines of
their homeworld, Kantah, could no longer fulfill their need for growth and
expansion. Of course, being the weak things they are, the Gemadak could not
handle the hard labour of building new settlements, so they turned to my
favourite method, slavery. Those days are gone, for the most part. Now they
spend most of their time trying to stop their own greatest creation, the

The Bridge.
The entirety of the bridge's northwestern wall is an open view of the space
outside. Arrayed equally before that window, in a loose triangle, are three
consoles, each containing a myriad of buttons, lights, and computer screens.
Heavy chairs sit before those consoles. Set back, equidistant between the outer
chairs, and directly between the foremost chair and the archway to the hall
southeast, is a wider console, set atop a raised dais, containing many more
buttons, lights, and screens. Behind this console, too, is a heavy chair. The
walls surrounding the window are composed of the same grey metal as the floor
and ceiling.

Between the Bridge and the Transport Room.
This space is wide, a polygon shaped by archways marking the entry into new
rooms north and south, and a hallway to the east. Metal, cold and grey, makes up
the many surfaces, coated with brownish filth. In the corners and along the
edges, the filth grows thickest, blacks and greens prevalent. The centre of the
floor is scuffed and scratched, evidence of much travel. The archways are
composed of straight lines and sharp angles, wider than they are tall. To the
northwest can be seen the Bridge, home to computers and chairs and a wide view
of the outside. Eastward is visible a hallway running away northeast. And, to
the south, stands the wide, flat platform of the Transporter.

This bag is of a plain blue colour with large straps for carrying it on one's
back. The name "Aurulius" is carefully etched on the side.
It appears to have one hundred twenty months of usefulness left.
It is holding:
a compact phaser, a loose-sleeved white shirt, a pair of grey denim pants
750 E-units.
587/587H 587/587M -
Alkari says, "As you can see, we've given you a small amount of money - known as
Energy Units, or e-units for short - to get you started, a basic set of clothes
to wear and a phaser."
[HINT: Energy Units, or e-units for short, is a form of currency in Tears of
Polaris. They are solidified energy that can be later be converted back into
pure energy with very little loss.]
587/587H 587/587M -

587/587H 587/587M -
Alkari says, "On the side of your weapon is a selector switch which has three
settings blast, beam, and burst. In addition there is a setting for strength,
between 1 and 100."
587/587H 587/587M -
Alkari says, "You should select blast at 50 on your pistol for this stage of
your training."
587/587H 587/587M -
[HINT: To change the settings of a phaser-based weapon, you use SELECT
[BLAST|BEAM|BURST] &lt;strength level> ON &lt;weapon>. Each type of attack has its own
strengths and weaknesses, which you will learn more about during the course of
the game. The higher you set your weapon's strength, the more damage it will do
to your opponents, but the faster it will run out of power. At this stage in the
introduction, you should use SELECT BLAST 50 ON PISTOL to set your pistol to use
the blast ability at 50% strength.]

523/587H 587/587M -
[HINT: Firing your pistol at enemies is as simple as typing FIRE AT &lt;target>. As
you learn more about phaser weapons you will learn different techniques for more
effective targeting and killing of your enemies. To complete your training you
must defeat Alkari by using FIRE AT ALKARI until he is dead or surrenders.]
