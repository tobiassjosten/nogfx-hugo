Congratulations! Your new character has been created.

You begin your journey in Tears of Polaris today as a 27 year old male Human 
named Torensius.
- 
In a moment, you shall be placed in a brief interactive tutorial. Within this 
introduction you will learn basic commands and concepts that you will need to 
begin your adventures in Tears of Polaris.

[TIP: Remember, you can adjust the speed of the introduction to your comfort 
level using the commands SPEEDUP and SLOWDOWN.
- 
The introduction can be completed within 10 minutes. You will gain some 
equipment, levels, skill lessons, and money through completing it. You cannot 
skip the introduction. Once it begins, you can adjust the speed using the 
commands SPEEDUP and SLOWDOWN. You can turn off the hints with HINTS OFF. Enter 
HELP INTRO at any time if you require help, or for more information.
- 
You settle back in a soft chair of the commercial craft, preparing for the long 
flight ahead. As you relax, sleep overcoming your senses, the hypnotic hum of 
the vessel is disturbed by a loud grinding. Waking with a start, you look about 
hurriedly. Screams and yells erupt from the front of the vessel as a bright 
flash of light blinds you. Your vision returns slowly, just enough for you to 
make out the dark, looming shape of a body before a heavy blow to the head robs 
you of your consciousness.
- 
As your consciousness returns, you are acutely aware of a hard, unforgiving 
surface beneath you. Through the thick fog that clouds your mind, you can make 
out the heavy breathing of multiple people around you. The memory of events 
prior flood into your consciousness, causing your eyes to fly open. You have 
barely enough time to translate the haze you see before you when a voice 
penetrates your awareness...
- 
A male voice says, "Psst, you ok?"
- 
A male voice says, "Hey, can you see me? Look around."
- look

[HINT: Type LOOK to look at the room.]
- 
A dirty cell.
This cell is cramped, the ceiling low and the walls close. Every surface is 
composed of hard, cold grey metal, save the door. The door is a thick, 
transparent plastic. Filth and grime coat everything, brown and black smudges 
and splodges marring even the door. The corners, especially, are home to thick 
mounds of dirt. Through the door, stretching away to the north, is a tight 
hallway, dimly lit.
Two burly guards stand here. A man in ragged clothing lies here.
There is a single exit here to the north.
- 
A male voice says, "Don&#39;t be so obvious about it, quickly look around."
- 
[HINT: Type QL to look at the room quickly.]
- ql

A dirty cell.
Two burly guards stand here. A man in ragged clothing lies here.
There is a single exit here to the north.
- 
A male voice says, "I&#39;m Farlek, what&#39;s your name?"
- 
Farlek says, "What&#39;s the matter, you can&#39;t remember how to say your name?"
- say torensius

You say, "Torensius."
- 
A rough male voice says, "It looks like prisoner 169 is awake. Let&#39;s take it to 
get checked out.
- 
A rough male voice says to you, "You, 169, stand up."
- stand

[HINT: Type STAND to stand up.]
- 
You stand straight up.
- 
The guard opens the door to your cell.

A rough male voice says to you, "Follow me."
- 
[HINT: Type FOLLOW GUARD to follow the guard.]

[TIP: Remember, you can adjust the speed of the introduction to your comfort 
level using the commands SPEEDUP and SLOWDOWN.
- follow guard

You begin to follow the guard.
- 
You follow close behind the guard, barely able to see around him in the tight 
hallway. The floors are cold on your bare feet. You pass other cells, the 
prisoners inside destitute.

A tight passage.
The cold grey walls of this hallway crowd the floor, allowing passage but little
else. Dim lights far overhead try to light the passage with a futile, dull glow.
Despite the light, the dirt coating every surface is plainly visible, further 
darkening the hallway. A thick transparent door of hard plastic closes off a 
cramped cell to the south. To the north, the hall opens eastward into wider 
space.
A burly guard stands here.
You see exits leading to the northeast and south.
- 
Eventually, the guard stops and steps aside, presenting you before a plain door 
in a small sitting room. Bolted to the door is a simple panel labeled "Doctor".

Outside the doctor&#39;s office.
This space is roughly triangular in shape, seeming more of a junction of the two
opposing hallways than a proper room. Short metal benches are bolted to the 
metal floor, their grey exterior blending into the walls. Covering everything is
a film of dirt, brown and black. A door sits in the eastern wall, a poorly 
attached slat of metal labelled "Doctor" hanging in its middle. The filth seems 
to grow thicker as it nears the southwestern hall, a dimly lit passage of tight 
walls. Northwest the surfaces have the vague impression of cleanliness, though 
by comparison only.
A burly guard stands here.
You see exits leading to the southwest, northwest and in.
- 
The guard says to you, "Wait here until the medic calls you in."
- 
The doctor tells you, "Prisoner 169 report."
- 
The doctor tells you, "Your implant must have been damaged. Come in the office 
now."
- 
[HINT: To move from room to room, you must type the direction of the exit you 
want to take from each room. If you don&#39;t know the exits, type QL to see them, 
then type one of the available directions, such as NORTH or N to move north. In 
this case, you will want to type IN to enter the doctor&#39;s office.]
- 
(Chat): Gonixus says, "Japhis where are you?"
- 
[HINT: To move from room to room, you must type the direction of the exit you 
want to take from each room. If you don&#39;t know the exits, type QL to see them, 
then type one of the available directions, such as NORTH or N to move north. In 
this case, you will want to type IN to enter the doctor&#39;s office.]
- in

The doctor&#39;s office.
This room is wide, stretching north to south more than east to west. Lining the 
room are numerous shelves, holding implements and utensils of vaguely medical 
nature, though they could just as easily qualify as tools of torture. In the 
southern end of the room is a short cot, its state suggesting regular 
occupation. The northern end holds a high, flat table, various tall stands 
holding yet more implements of medicine around it. A large light hangs over 
them. A deep sink sits within a low counter in the northeastern corner of the 
room, sanitation supplies beside it. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all 
composed of the same grey metal, brownish filth growing in the corners of the 
room. A single door stands in the western wall.
A doctor stands here, clothed in blood-stained white robes.
There is a single exit here to the out.
- 
You enter the cramped office, your eyes focusing quickly on the myriad sharp 
implements of medical torture. A short, balding human in a dirty lab coat, a 
scanning device in his hands, ushers you over to a flat examining table. He 
flaps his hands at you, ordering you to lie flat. The scanning device comes to 
life, soft beeps coming from it as the doctor passes it over you.
- 
(Chat): Japhis says, "I know where you are."
- 
The doctor says, "That should do it, now concentrate and telepathically tell me 
hello."
- 
[HINT: Type TELL DOCTOR HELLO to test your ability to speak telepathically.]
- 
(Chat): Gonixus says, "Are you Alright is what I mean."
- 
(Chat): Balanar says, "Will we keep these chars for the release?"
- tell doctor hello

You tell the doctor, "Hello."
- 
The doctor says to you, "Good. Now that we know your implant is working, perhaps
you can get one of those nanoid masses, the health nanoid."
- 
[HINT: Type GET HEALTH or G HEALTH to pick up health nanoids. This command will 
only work on a group of nanoids containing health curing nanites. To get nanoids
of any type, you can use GET NANOID.]
- get health

You reach for a gelatinous mass of nanoids, but the doctor quickly smacks your 
hand away.
- 
The doctor says, "That one is a poison, don&#39;t you know anything? You need to use
your eyes to get information about your current location, in this case here, 
then get the other nanoid mass."
- 
[HINT: To gain detailed information about items in the room type INFOHERE or IH,
then use the item number for the specific item you wish to GET.  For example, 
GET 1234 would pick up the item numbered 1234.]
- infohere

then ask your question NEWBIE <question here> I or someone else will try and 
provide the best answers we can."
- 
(Chat): Gonixus says, "Nope, these will be deleted Monday september 19th 0:00 
GMT."

-
In a moment, you shall be placed in a brief interactive tutorial. Within this
introduction you will learn basic commands and concepts that you will need to
begin your adventures in Tears of Polaris.
[TIP: Remember, you can adjust the speed of the introduction to your comfort
level using the commands SPEEDUP and SLOWDOWN.
-
The introduction can be completed within 10 minutes. You will gain some
equipment, levels, skill lessons, and money through completing it. You cannot
skip the introduction. Once it begins, you can adjust the speed using the
commands SPEEDUP and SLOWDOWN. You can turn off the hints with HINTS OFF. Enter
HELP INTRO at any time if you require help, or for more information.
-
You settle back in a soft chair of the commercial craft, preparing for the long
flight ahead. As you relax, sleep overcoming your senses, the hypnotic hum of
the vessel is disturbed by a loud grinding. Waking with a start, you look about
hurriedly. Screams and yells erupt from the front of the vessel as a bright
flash of light blinds you. Your vision returns slowly, just enough for you to
make out the dark, looming shape of a body before a heavy blow to the head robs
you of your consciousness.
-
As your consciousness returns, you are acutely aware of a hard, unforgiving
surface beneath you. Through the thick fog that clouds your mind, you can make
out the heavy breathing of multiple people around you. The memory of events
prior flood into your consciousness, causing your eyes to fly open. You have
barely enough time to translate the haze you see before you when a voice
penetrates your awareness...
-
A male voice says, "Psst, you ok?"
-
A male voice says, "Hey, can you see me? Look around."
- look
[HINT: Type LOOK to look at the room.]
-
A dirty cell.
This cell is cramped, the ceiling low and the walls close. Every surface is
composed of hard, cold grey metal, save the door. The door is a thick,
transparent plastic. Filth and grime coat everything, brown and black smudges
and splodges marring even the door. The corners, especially, are home to thick
mounds of dirt. Through the door, stretching away to the north, is a tight
hallway, dimly lit.
Two burly guards stand here. A man in ragged clothing lies here.
There is a single exit here to the north.
-
A male voice says, "Don't be so obvious about it, quickly look around."
-
[HINT: Type QL to look at the room quickly.]
- ql
A dirty cell.
Two burly guards stand here. A man in ragged clothing lies here.
There is a single exit here to the north.
-
A male voice says, "I'm Farlek, what's your name?"
-
Farlek says, "What's the matter, you can't remember how to say your name?"
- say torensius
You say, "Torensius."
-
A rough male voice says, "It looks like prisoner 169 is awake. Let's take it to
get checked out.
-
A rough male voice says to you, "You, 169, stand up."
- stand
[HINT: Type STAND to stand up.]
-
You stand straight up.
-
The guard opens the door to your cell.
A rough male voice says to you, "Follow me."
-
[HINT: Type FOLLOW GUARD to follow the guard.]
[TIP: Remember, you can adjust the speed of the introduction to your comfort
level using the commands SPEEDUP and SLOWDOWN.
- follow guard
You begin to follow the guard.
-
You follow close behind the guard, barely able to see around him in the tight
hallway. The floors are cold on your bare feet. You pass other cells, the
prisoners inside destitute.
A tight passage.
The cold grey walls of this hallway crowd the floor, allowing passage but little
else. Dim lights far overhead try to light the passage with a futile, dull glow.
Despite the light, the dirt coating every surface is plainly visible, further
darkening the hallway. A thick transparent door of hard plastic closes off a
cramped cell to the south. To the north, the hall opens eastward into wider
space.
A burly guard stands here.
You see exits leading to the northeast and south.
-
Eventually, the guard stops and steps aside, presenting you before a plain door
in a small sitting room. Bolted to the door is a simple panel labeled "Doctor".
Outside the doctor's office.
This space is roughly triangular in shape, seeming more of a junction of the two
opposing hallways than a proper room. Short metal benches are bolted to the
metal floor, their grey exterior blending into the walls. Covering everything is
a film of dirt, brown and black. A door sits in the eastern wall, a poorly
attached slat of metal labelled "Doctor" hanging in its middle. The filth seems
to grow thicker as it nears the southwestern hall, a dimly lit passage of tight
walls. Northwest the surfaces have the vague impression of cleanliness, though
by comparison only.
A burly guard stands here.
You see exits leading to the southwest, northwest and in.
-
The guard says to you, "Wait here until the medic calls you in."
-
The doctor tells you, "Prisoner 169 report."
-
The doctor tells you, "Your implant must have been damaged. Come in the office
now."
-
[HINT: To move from room to room, you must type the direction of the exit you
want to take from each room. If you don't know the exits, type QL to see them,
then type one of the available directions, such as NORTH or N to move north. In
this case, you will want to type IN to enter the doctor's office.]
-
(Chat): Gonixus says, "Japhis where are you?"
-

- in
The doctor's office.
This room is wide, stretching north to south more than east to west. Lining the
room are numerous shelves, holding implements and utensils of vaguely medical
nature, though they could just as easily qualify as tools of torture. In the
southern end of the room is a short cot, its state suggesting regular
occupation. The northern end holds a high, flat table, various tall stands
holding yet more implements of medicine around it. A large light hangs over
them. A deep sink sits within a low counter in the northeastern corner of the
room, sanitation supplies beside it. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all
composed of the same grey metal, brownish filth growing in the corners of the
room. A single door stands in the western wall.
A doctor stands here, clothed in blood-stained white robes.
There is a single exit here to the out.
-
You enter the cramped office, your eyes focusing quickly on the myriad sharp
implements of medical torture. A short, balding human in a dirty lab coat, a
scanning device in his hands, ushers you over to a flat examining table. He
flaps his hands at you, ordering you to lie flat. The scanning device comes to
life, soft beeps coming from it as the doctor passes it over you.
-
(Chat): Japhis says, "I know where you are."
-
The doctor says, "That should do it, now concentrate and telepathically tell me
hello."
-
[HINT: Type TELL DOCTOR HELLO to test your ability to speak telepathically.]
-
(Chat): Gonixus says, "Are you Alright is what I mean."
-
(Chat): Balanar says, "Will we keep these chars for the release?"
- tell doctor hello
You tell the doctor, "Hello."
-
The doctor says to you, "Good. Now that we know your implant is working, perhaps
you can get one of those nanoid masses, the health nanoid."
-
[HINT: Type GET HEALTH or G HEALTH to pick up health nanoids. This command will
only work on a group of nanoids containing health curing nanites. To get nanoids
of any type, you can use GET NANOID.]
- get health
You reach for a gelatinous mass of nanoids, but the doctor quickly smacks your
hand away.
-
The doctor says, "That one is a poison, don't you know anything? You need to use
your eyes to get information about your current location, in this case here,
then get the other nanoid mass."
-
[HINT: To gain detailed information about items in the room type INFOHERE or IH,
then use the item number for the specific item you wish to GET. For example,
GET 1234 would pick up the item numbered 1234.]
- infohere

(Chat): Gonixus says, "For the most amount of Help you may want to use NEWBIEON
then ask your question NEWBIE &lt;question here> I or someone else will try and
provide the best answers we can."
-
(Chat): Gonixus says, "Nope, these will be deleted Monday september 19th 0:00
GMT."
-
(Chat): Balanar says, "I see."

people can mess up the game before we release the full thing so it doesn't
completely snafu like what happened in Midkemia Online."

done, Kunin says by the end of the year "I'm hoping that's for closed beta
though"."
