Havens of the Touched.
Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal&#39;s plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface. 
This area is badly burned.

A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy 
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the 
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of 
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted 
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here, 
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent 
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents 
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is 
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this 
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the

contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal&#39;s plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. Eighteen corpses of Orrun lie here haphazardly. Nine corpses of Neilan lie
here haphazardly. The corpse of Mallith lies here. Five corpses of Renthur lie 
here haphazardly. Two corpses of Krax lie here haphazardly. Four corpses of

You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.

North of a waterfall.
The tips of thick, green vines skim the azure-veined white marble of the 
walkway. The vines, upon which grow broad, flat leaves, have burst forth over 
the edge of a high wall bordering the walkway&#39;s eastern and western edges. The 
walls are a pure white stone, in which has been etched symmetrical, geometrical 
patterns of spirals and knots, and smoothly curving and sharply angled bands. 
The southern end of the walkway empties into a marble clearing, the centre of 
which is home to a large waterfall falling endlessly upward.
You see exits leading to the north and south.

Northern garden path.
Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western 
edges, the walkway widens to the north, curving smoothly outward. Upon the 
walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are 
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting 
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of 
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.
You see exits leading to the north and south.

Path around an elevated garden.
The northernmost edge of the outer ring stands open to the pale blue sky, held 
in check by nought but the clouds and the horizon. The walls buttressing its 
southern edges, where it runs southeast and northwest, split by a walkway 
leading directly south, are tall white stone, immaculate; carved within those 
walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting 
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling
down from the tops of the walls, attempt to mask the arabesque designs, broad 
leaves claiming further space.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.
Four green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the 
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves. 
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the 
north.
A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for safety. A
garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under the 
fallen leaves.
You see exits leading to the northeast, east and southeast.

Western garden path.
The white marble walkway, shot through with azure veins, runs straight east and 
west, where it widens in a gradual outward curve to meet the outer ring of the 
garden. Tall walls of immaculate white stone direct the walkway, following both 
the straight edges and curves. Carved within the walls, visible beneath thick 
tendrils of vegetation that spill over the top, are carved symmetrical patterns 
of complex spirals and curved bands, highlighted by the occasional sharp angle.
A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for safety. 
Three caterpillars squirm around the garden, looking for fresh foliage to eat.

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the 
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines, 
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of 
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny 
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into 
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the 
clouds.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for 
safety.
You see exits leading to the east and west.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. Eighteen corpses of Orrun lie here haphazardly. Nine corpses of Neilan lie
here haphazardly. The corpse of Mallith lies here. Five corpses of Renthur lie 
here haphazardly. Two corpses of Krax lie here haphazardly. Four corpses of 
Vandimer lie here haphazardly. The corpse of Japhis lies here. Nine corpses of 
Allos lie here haphazardly. A small pile of fifty-two live E-units have been 
left here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself 
for safety. A broken statue lies here, barely more than a pile of rocks. Two 
corpses of Aurulius lie here haphazardly. A caterpillar squirms around the 
ground, looking for fresh foliage to eat.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent.

deisease digitalis and then attempting to sip health. When the victim vomits the

Havens of the Touched.
Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete
access around it. The portal's plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.
This area is badly burned.

A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here,
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.
The corpse of Seuter lies here.

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the

contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete
access around it. The portal's plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides
here. Eighteen corpses of Orrun lie here haphazardly. Nine corpses of Neilan lie

North of a waterfall.
The tips of thick, green vines skim the azure-veined white marble of the
walkway. The vines, upon which grow broad, flat leaves, have burst forth over
the edge of a high wall bordering the walkway's eastern and western edges. The
walls are a pure white stone, in which has been etched symmetrical, geometrical
patterns of spirals and knots, and smoothly curving and sharply angled bands.

Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western
edges, the walkway widens to the north, curving smoothly outward. Upon the
walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.

The northernmost edge of the outer ring stands open to the pale blue sky, held
in check by nought but the clouds and the horizon. The walls buttressing its
southern edges, where it runs southeast and northwest, split by a walkway
leading directly south, are tall white stone, immaculate; carved within those
walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling
down from the tops of the walls, attempt to mask the arabesque designs, broad
leaves claiming further space.

in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira,
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.
Four green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for
safety. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself
under the fallen leaves.
You see exits leading to the northeast and southwest.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves.
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the
north.
A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for safety. A
garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under the
fallen leaves.

Western garden path.
The white marble walkway, shot through with azure veins, runs straight east and
west, where it widens in a gradual outward curve to meet the outer ring of the
garden. Tall walls of immaculate white stone direct the walkway, following both
the straight edges and curves. Carved within the walls, visible beneath thick
tendrils of vegetation that spill over the top, are carved symmetrical patterns
of complex spirals and curved bands, highlighted by the occasional sharp angle.
A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for safety.
Three caterpillars squirm around the garden, looking for fresh foliage to eat.

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines,
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the
clouds.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for
safety.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides
here. Eighteen corpses of Orrun lie here haphazardly. Nine corpses of Neilan lie
here haphazardly. The corpse of Mallith lies here. Five corpses of Renthur lie
here haphazardly. Two corpses of Krax lie here haphazardly. Four corpses of
Vandimer lie here haphazardly. The corpse of Japhis lies here. Nine corpses of

corpses of Aurulius lie here haphazardly. A caterpillar squirms around the
ground, looking for fresh foliage to eat.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent.
