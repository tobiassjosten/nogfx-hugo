746/746H 746/746M - w

A landing before a shop.
A ceiling of pearlescent white adobe, radiant in various rainbow hues, covers 
the landing at the top of the stairs. Wide pillars of the same adobe support the
ceiling, a repeating pattern of abstract leaf and thick, gentle strokes, curled 
and complex, carved into their surface. To the east stands a bare wall with 
sliding doors in its centre. Westward, the stairs descend to meet a wide walkway
of adobe, girded by silver metal.
You see exits leading to the east and down.
746/746H 746/746M - d

Before a flight of stairs.
Rising from the north side of the wide walkway are stairs, climbing toward a 
wide square building set back against the walkway&#39;s outer edge. The ground floor
of the building is wide open, supported by four thick corner beams and enclosed 
by a porous lattice of arabesque design. Flowers and plants of all shapes and 
colours seek to spill from the lattice, their rainbow petals pushing through. 
Thick metal beams form the edges of the walkway as it continues east toward a 
steep ramp, and northwest toward a bend. Trees carpet the earth beneath the 
walkway, stretching away toward the mountain wall to the north; south they stop 
only at the skyline. In the far eastern distance can be made out the tops of 
shimmering white buildings.
You see exits leading to the northwest and up.
746/746H 746/746M - nw

A bend in the walkway.
The walkway is built of pearlescent white adobe, set between thick beams of 
silver metal. Short walls of the same adobe line the walkway, an ever-repeating 
design of swirling leaves and thick, bold lines covering their surface. Along 
the top of the wall are tall spires, topped in wide bulbs that thin to sharp 
needles. Trees, wide and green, cloak the ground beneath the walkway, growing 
north to meet the mountain wall, and stretching south toward the horizon. The 
walkway turns to the southeast here, and runs westward toward the distance wall 
of a large building.
You see exits leading to the southeast and west.
746/746H 746/746M - w

On a walkway above the trees.
Thick metal beams, running between wide paths of shimmering, multi-hued white 
adobe, support the walkway as it spans the tops of wide, green trees below. 
Short walls of the same adobe gird the walkway, covered in scrolling designs of 
abstract leaves and thick, smoothly curving lines in an ever-repeating pattern. 
Tall, thin spires, topped with wide bulbs and sharp needles, sit at regular 
intervals along the walls. To the north the trees push up against solid mountain
wall, while to the south they stretch as if to the horizon. The walkway runs 
east, where it begins a southward curve, and west, to meet the flat face of a 
large white building.
You see exits leading to the east and west.
746/746H 746/746M - w

Before a warehouse.
To the northwest is the tall face of an otherwise nondescript building, composed
of the iridescent adobe, a shimmering white of myriad hues. Set high in the wall
are thin windows, their tops rounded. A sliding door sits in the center of the 
building&#39;s face. Below the walkway are the tops of wide, short trees, stretching
away in all directions. To the east the adobe walkway, supported by smooth beams
of silver metal, stretches above the tree line; southeast it winds its way 
beneath a tall canopy of similar adobe, ending before a squat, square building.
You see exits leading to the east, southeast and in.
746/746H 746/746M - 
(Newbie): Izarin says, "Aurulius, were you able to get your &#39;Stub characters&#39; 
past that point in the quest?"
746/746H 746/746M - newbie Yes, but I had to use IH Nanoid, like you said.

(Newbie): You say, "Yes, but I had to use IH Nanoid, like you said."
746/746H 746/746M - in

An enormous warehouse.
Disappearing into the recesses of the warehouse to the west are a multitude of 
tall scaffolds, composed of multiple shelves, each stuffed full of various 
supplies. The ceiling is visible only as muted lighting, seeming to converge on 
a single point in the far western horizon. Set a short distance in front of 
those shelves is a solitary desk, a chair behind it. The desk faces east, toward
the sliding doors standing within the vast outer wall.
There is a single exit here to the out.

A covered walkway.
A high ceiling shades this otherwise open walkway, suspended high above the tops
of wide, green trees. Made from the same adobe as the ceiling, shimmering a 
multi-faceted white, tall, square pillars line the edge of the path. An 
ever-repeating design of leaves and bold, thick lines, convoluted and complex, 
has been shaped into the sides of the pillars. To the northwest the walkway 
continues above the tree line, ending before the white face of a squat building.
Southwest, set within an otherwise nondescript wall, is a sliding door.
You see exits leading to the southwest and northwest.
746/746H 746/746M - sw

A transporter room.
A flat panel of translucent glass covers the top of the dais in the middle of 
the room. Beneath that glass is naught but smooth black. Computers, wires, and 
electronics of all kinds surround the glass dais, their lights ever lit. The 
surrounding room is composed of flat walls of pearlescent adobe, its white 
shimmering beneath a veneer of similar glass. The room is spacious, though the 
dais occupying its southwestern corner takes up much of its volume. Set in the 
northeastern wall is a sliding door.
There is a single exit here to the northeast.
746/746H 746/746M - beam up to havens

You concentrate on returning to the Havens.
Havens of the Touched.
Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal&#39;s plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.
Three corpses of Bryana lie here haphazardly. The corpse of Meldaire lies here. 
The corpse of Shardorn lies here. The corpse of Nerto lies here.
Talvan is here.
There are no exits here.
A portal to the meeting grounds floats here. (ENTER MEETING)

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for 
safety. Two caterpillars squirm around the garden, looking for fresh foliage to 
eat. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under 
the fallen leaves.
Mildena is here. Izarin is here.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent. 
(ENTER WATERFALL)
The Babyl Overseer says, "Welcome, Aurulius. I&#39;ve been expecting you. Give me a 
proper GREETing, and we&#39;ll begin with your learning."
746/746H 746/746M - greet overseer

You nod your head at the Babyl Overseer and say, "Greetings."
The Babyl Overseer says, "That&#39;s more like it, Aurulius. Now, let&#39;s get down to 
it. There are some basic things you can&#39;t get away with not knowing, so I&#39;m 
going to make sure you learn how to use that brain of yours."

and I&#39;ll try to open your eyes to the less obvious parts of the universe too."

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for 
safety. Two caterpillars squirm around the garden, looking for fresh foliage to 
eat. Two garden snakes slither along the ground, attempting to hide themselves 
under fallen leaves.
Japhis is here. Mildena is here. Izarin is here.

North of a waterfall.
The tips of thick, green vines skim the azure-veined white marble of the 
walkway. The vines, upon which grow broad, flat leaves, have burst forth over 
the edge of a high wall bordering the walkway&#39;s eastern and western edges. The 
walls are a pure white stone, in which has been etched symmetrical, geometrical 
patterns of spirals and knots, and smoothly curving and sharply angled bands. 
The southern end of the walkway empties into a marble clearing, the centre of 
which is home to a large waterfall falling endlessly upward.

Northern garden path.
Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western 
edges, the walkway widens to the north, curving smoothly outward. Upon the 
walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are 
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting 
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of 
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.

The northernmost edge of the outer ring stands open to the pale blue sky, held 
in check by nought but the clouds and the horizon. The walls buttressing its 
southern edges, where it runs southeast and northwest, split by a walkway 
leading directly south, are tall white stone, immaculate; carved within those 
walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting 
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling

Eastern garden wall.
A wide walkway of azure-marbled white stone forms the eastern edge of the ring 
around the garden, curving westward to both the north and south. Directly west 
the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white 
of clouds. Far above, through a screen of those same white clouds, can be made

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.

Behind a statue in a garden.
Heavy roots break through the soft soil of the ceiling of this dusky room. Save 
for the small patch of ceiling, little is left to remind one of the world 
outside the door. The floor is a solidified collection of images: mixed in is 
sky and earth, faces, clothing, buildings, and more images too small or too 
indistinct to make out. There are no visible walls, instead an endless expanse 
of cloudy shades of grey. To the northwest is a rectangle of immaculate white 
stone, engraved in which are glowing arabesque patterns: geometrical shapes 
composed of thick bands that at times curve gently, and other times take sharp 
turns, crossing and coalescing in perfect symmetry in infinitely changing, 
infinitely varied modes.
There is a single exit here to the northwest.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the 
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal&#39;s plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides

East of a waterfall.
Heavy green vines, overflowing the short white walls to the north and south, 
threaten to overtake the marbled stone, having already hidden the high white 
walls meant to contain them. Where the vines have not enshrouded the walls can 
be seen scroll-work patterns of interlocking spirals and knots, a mix of lazy 
curves and acute angles. Forced by the vine-laden walls, the white marble of the
walk runs east and west.

A wide walkway of azure-marbled white stone forms the eastern edge of the ring 
around the garden, curving westward to both the north and south. Directly west 
the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white 
of clouds. Far above, through a screen of those same white clouds, can be made 
out patches of brown and, to the northeast, gold.

Southern edge of a garden.
Nought but blue sky borders the southern edge of the wide outer ring of the 
garden. The outer ring is composed of broad seamless marble, white veined with 
azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another 
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner 
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer 
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy 
vines and broad green leaves, spilling out over the tops of the walls, obscures 
the complex arabesque patterns on the walls.

of curving lines, complex knots, and sharp angles are carved into the immaculate

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for 
safety. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself 
under the fallen leaves.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent.

Small and lightweight, this phaser can easily be wielded with a single hand. 
Metallic in colour, several buttons are conveniently placed to ensure the prompt
and safe changing of settings and quick firing. Resin grips don each side of the
pistol, easing the strain on the hand from constant grip as well as providing a 
barrier between the user and the heat generated from the firing of the gun. Open
sights are placed upon the gun and ensure accuracy when used properly, however 
they appear to be more of a cosmetic addition than placed for constant use.
It appears to have sixty months of usefulness left.
It currently holds 230/223 units of energy.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the 
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves. 
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the 
north.

A path around an isolated garden.
A tall wall of immaculate white stone girds the inner edge of the blue-veined 
marble walkway that is the outer ring of the garden. Carved in the wall are 
complex patterns of knots and spirals, save the very centre in which is 
displayed the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Thick vines, covered in broad, flat 
leaves of green, obscure the walls, masking the arabesque designs. The walkway 
curves away from the sigil northwest and southeast. The southwestern edge of the
outer ring is open to the horizon, revealing only blue sky below and, far above,
through a thin layer of clouds, smudges of brown and red.

Nought but blue sky borders the southern edge of the wide outer ring of the 
garden. The outer ring is composed of broad seamless marble, white veined with 
azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another 
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner 
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer 
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy 
vines and broad green leaves, spilling out over the tops of the walls, obscures 
the complex arabesque patterns on the walls.

Eastern garden wall.
A wide walkway of azure-marbled white stone forms the eastern edge of the ring 
around the garden, curving westward to both the north and south. Directly west 
the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white

the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the 
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines, 
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of 
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny 
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into 
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the

In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with

Southern edge of a garden.
Nought but blue sky borders the southern edge of the wide outer ring of the 
garden. The outer ring is composed of broad seamless marble, white veined with 
azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another 
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner 
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer 
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy 
vines and broad green leaves, spilling out over the tops of the walls, obscures 
the complex arabesque patterns on the walls.

encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the

Eastern garden wall.
A wide walkway of azure-marbled white stone forms the eastern edge of the ring 
around the garden, curving westward to both the north and south. Directly west 
the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white 
of clouds. Far above, through a screen of those same white clouds, can be made

A path around an isolated garden.
In the centre of the high wall, its curve southward along the inner rim of the 
white and azure marble of the wide walkway, peeking out from behind thick 
tendrils of leafy vines, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, proud Elaran 
features replicated in uncanny detail. The rest of the wall, stretching away 
both northeast and southwest, is a complex collection of crossing curved lines 
and sharp-angled knots. Opposite the wall, to the southwest, is only open

azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another 
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner 
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer 
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy 
vines and broad green leaves, spilling out over the tops of the walls, obscures 
the complex arabesque patterns on the walls.

A tall wall of immaculate white stone girds the inner edge of the blue-veined 
marble walkway that is the outer ring of the garden. Carved in the wall are 
complex patterns of knots and spirals, save the very centre in which is 
displayed the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Thick vines, covered in broad, flat 
leaves of green, obscure the walls, masking the arabesque designs. The walkway 
curves away from the sigil northwest and southeast. The southwestern edge of the

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the 
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines, 
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of 
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny 
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into 
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the 
clouds.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress

A wide walkway of azure-marbled white stone forms the eastern edge of the ring

the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty

A path around an isolated garden.
A tall wall of immaculate white stone girds the inner edge of the blue-veined 
marble walkway that is the outer ring of the garden. Carved in the wall are 
complex patterns of knots and spirals, save the very centre in which is 
displayed the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Thick vines, covered in broad, flat 
leaves of green, obscure the walls, masking the arabesque designs. The walkway 
curves away from the sigil northwest and southeast. The southwestern edge of the
outer ring is open to the horizon, revealing only blue sky below and, far above,

smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.

The northernmost edge of the outer ring stands open to the pale blue sky, held 
in check by nought but the clouds and the horizon. The walls buttressing its 
southern edges, where it runs southeast and northwest, split by a walkway 
leading directly south, are tall white stone, immaculate; carved within those 
walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting 
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling
down from the tops of the walls, attempt to mask the arabesque designs, broad

Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western

walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are 
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting 
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of 
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.

Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides

746/746H 746/746M - ask overseer about pills

You ask the Babyl Overseer, "About pills."
The Babyl Overseer says, "Ahh, so you&#39;re ready to learn about the pills we&#39;ve 
got, Aurulius? Well, first off, we have the laminin pill. This pill works great 
against paralysis."
746/746H 746/746M - 
The Babyl Overseer says, "Lurking inside of Babyl&#39;s forest, you&#39;ll find 
poisonous frogs hopping around. You shouldn&#39;t have trouble spotting them, 
because they don&#39;t even bother hiding. Their poison protects them well."
746/746H 746/746M - 
The Babyl Overseer says, "Here; take these. They&#39;re perfectly edible, just EAT 
PILL when necessary."
The Babyl Overseer hands you five laminin pills.
746/746H 746/746M - 
The Babyl Overseer says, "Use those pills to quickly cure yourself of their 
paralysis, and go out and kill enough to collect three frog toes. And when 
you&#39;re done, bring me the little toes as proof of your deed. If you lose your 
pills or run out, you can always CONCENTRATE ON BODY to cure yourself, but it 
takes some time."

North of a waterfall.
The tips of thick, green vines skim the azure-veined white marble of the 
walkway. The vines, upon which grow broad, flat leaves, have burst forth over 
the edge of a high wall bordering the walkway&#39;s eastern and western edges. The 
walls are a pure white stone, in which has been etched symmetrical, geometrical 
patterns of spirals and knots, and smoothly curving and sharply angled bands. 
The southern end of the walkway empties into a marble clearing, the centre of 
which is home to a large waterfall falling endlessly upward.
A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under the 
fallen leaves.

Northern garden path.
Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western 
edges, the walkway widens to the north, curving smoothly outward. Upon the 
walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are 
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting 
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of 
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.

Path around an elevated garden.
The northernmost edge of the outer ring stands open to the pale blue sky, held 
in check by nought but the clouds and the horizon. The walls buttressing its 
southern edges, where it runs southeast and northwest, split by a walkway 
leading directly south, are tall white stone, immaculate; carved within those 
walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting 
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling
down from the tops of the walls, attempt to mask the arabesque designs, broad 
leaves claiming further space.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the 
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves. 
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the 
north.

A tall wall of immaculate white stone girds the inner edge of the blue-veined 
marble walkway that is the outer ring of the garden. Carved in the wall are 
complex patterns of knots and spirals, save the very centre in which is 
displayed the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Thick vines, covered in broad, flat 
leaves of green, obscure the walls, masking the arabesque designs. The walkway 
curves away from the sigil northwest and southeast. The southwestern edge of the
outer ring is open to the horizon, revealing only blue sky below and, far above,
through a thin layer of clouds, smudges of brown and red.

Small and lightweight, this phaser can easily be wielded with a single hand. 
Metallic in colour, several buttons are conveniently placed to ensure the prompt
and safe changing of settings and quick firing. Resin grips don each side of the
pistol, easing the strain on the hand from constant grip as well as providing a 
barrier between the user and the heat generated from the firing of the gun. Open
sights are placed upon the gun and ensure accuracy when used properly, however 
they appear to be more of a cosmetic addition than placed for constant use.

Far above the northeastern edge of the outer ring, through a veil of wispy 
clouds, can be seen a giant golden smudge; below is nought but blue sky. A 
curved wall, its apex pointing toward open sky, of immaculate white stone girds 
the inner edge of the ring. Complex geometrical shapes, composed of curving 
bands and sharp angles in loose symmetry, cover the whole of the wall save its 
centre; upon its apex is engraved the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Tangled masses
of vines and flat leaves obscure the wall.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for

In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.
A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for safety. A
garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under the 
fallen leaves.

smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they

Path around an elevated garden.
The northernmost edge of the outer ring stands open to the pale blue sky, held 
in check by nought but the clouds and the horizon. The walls buttressing its 
southern edges, where it runs southeast and northwest, split by a walkway 
leading directly south, are tall white stone, immaculate; carved within those 
walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting 
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling
down from the tops of the walls, attempt to mask the arabesque designs, broad 
leaves claiming further space.

Northern garden path.
Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western 
edges, the walkway widens to the north, curving smoothly outward. Upon the 
walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are 
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting 
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of 
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.

North of a waterfall.
The tips of thick, green vines skim the azure-veined white marble of the 
walkway. The vines, upon which grow broad, flat leaves, have burst forth over 
the edge of a high wall bordering the walkway&#39;s eastern and western edges. The 
walls are a pure white stone, in which has been etched symmetrical, geometrical 
patterns of spirals and knots, and smoothly curving and sharply angled bands. 
The southern end of the walkway empties into a marble clearing, the centre of 
which is home to a large waterfall falling endlessly upward.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.

Southern edge of a garden.
Nought but blue sky borders the southern edge of the wide outer ring of the 
garden. The outer ring is composed of broad seamless marble, white veined with 
azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another 
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner 
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer 
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy 
vines and broad green leaves, spilling out over the tops of the walls, obscures 
the complex arabesque patterns on the walls.

white and azure marble of the wide walkway, peeking out from behind thick 
tendrils of leafy vines, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, proud Elaran 
features replicated in uncanny detail. The rest of the wall, stretching away 
both northeast and southwest, is a complex collection of crossing curved lines 
and sharp-angled knots. Opposite the wall, to the southwest, is only open 
horizon. Far above the garden walkways, through a layer of clouds, are the

the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white 
of clouds. Far above, through a screen of those same white clouds, can be made 
out patches of brown and, to the northeast, gold.

the inner edge of the ring. Complex geometrical shapes, composed of curving

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.

the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white

a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the

Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the

encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved

A path around an isolated garden.
In the centre of the high wall, its curve southward along the inner rim of the 
white and azure marble of the wide walkway, peeking out from behind thick 
tendrils of leafy vines, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, proud Elaran 
features replicated in uncanny detail. The rest of the wall, stretching away 
both northeast and southwest, is a complex collection of crossing curved lines 
and sharp-angled knots. Opposite the wall, to the southwest, is only open 
horizon. Far above the garden walkways, through a layer of clouds, are the

A wide walkway of azure-marbled white stone forms the eastern edge of the ring 
around the garden, curving westward to both the north and south. Directly west 
the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white

his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured

meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the

around the garden, curving westward to both the north and south. Directly west 
the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure 
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white 
of clouds. Far above, through a screen of those same white clouds, can be made 
out patches of brown and, to the northeast, gold.
Nomyar is here.
You see exits leading to the southwest, west and northwest.

Path around an elevated garden.
Far above the northeastern edge of the outer ring, through a veil of wispy 
clouds, can be seen a giant golden smudge; below is nought but blue sky. A 
curved wall, its apex pointing toward open sky, of immaculate white stone girds 
the inner edge of the ring. Complex geometrical shapes, composed of curving 
bands and sharp angles in loose symmetry, cover the whole of the wall save its 
centre; upon its apex is engraved the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Tangled masses
of vines and flat leaves obscure the wall.
A slimy pile of goo and fuzz is all that remains of a caterpillar.

Path around an elevated garden.
The northernmost edge of the outer ring stands open to the pale blue sky, held 
in check by nought but the clouds and the horizon. The walls buttressing its 
southern edges, where it runs southeast and northwest, split by a walkway 
leading directly south, are tall white stone, immaculate; carved within those 
walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting 
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling
down from the tops of the walls, attempt to mask the arabesque designs, broad 
leaves claiming further space.
A green recycler sits on a small wooden platform here.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.
A slimy pile of goo and fuzz is all that remains of a caterpillar.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the 
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves. 
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the 
north.
You see exits leading to the northeast, east and southeast.

A path around an isolated garden.
A tall wall of immaculate white stone girds the inner edge of the blue-veined 
marble walkway that is the outer ring of the garden. Carved in the wall are 
complex patterns of knots and spirals, save the very centre in which is 
displayed the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Thick vines, covered in broad, flat 
leaves of green, obscure the walls, masking the arabesque designs. The walkway 
curves away from the sigil northwest and southeast. The southwestern edge of the
outer ring is open to the horizon, revealing only blue sky below and, far above,
through a thin layer of clouds, smudges of brown and red.

713/825H 746/825M - probe phaser

Small and lightweight, this phaser can easily be wielded with a single hand. 
Metallic in colour, several buttons are conveniently placed to ensure the prompt
and safe changing of settings and quick firing. Resin grips don each side of the
pistol, easing the strain on the hand from constant grip as well as providing a 
barrier between the user and the heat generated from the firing of the gun. Open
sights are placed upon the gun and ensure accuracy when used properly, however 
they appear to be more of a cosmetic addition than placed for constant use.
It appears to have sixty months of usefulness left.
It currently holds 8/223 units of energy.
The power gauge glows a bright green.
It weighs about 170jm.
It is holding:
Nothing.

Havens of the Touched.
Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal&#39;s plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

The Arena Supply Store.
Wooden shelves line the walls of this great metallic building, their surfaces 
overflowing with phials of nanites and other assorted goods. A harsh overhead 
light illuminates the surroundings and casts sharp pitch shadows through the 
chamber.
Four corpses of Visaerisdos lie here haphazardly.

Arena Staging Grounds.
Light filters into this dark-lit room through the large iron gate on the north 
wall. Through the gate the entry way to the arena beyond can be seen.
A sturdy forge stands here, cold and dark.
There is a single exit here to the south.
A doorway leading to the diner is here. (ENTER DOOR)

The Diner at the Beginning of the Universe.
Chairs and tables have been arranged across the checkered floor of this retro 
diner. A chrome-plated self serve soda fountain sits on the counter against the 
west wall with vintage Slusho glasses sitting stacked to the side. A distinctive
jukebox sits in the northwestern corner of the room with real vinyl records and 
an archaic coin slot. A swinging door to the north bears the phrase, "Don&#39;t 
Panic" in bright, cheery letters.
You see exits leading to the east, west and down.
A doorway of blinding light stands upright in the middle of the room. (ENTER

An outdoor trading shop.
Carved out of a large sandstone rock formation, this trading post is small, 
providing just enough room for several patrons to enter and still be within the 
carving of the rock. A makeshift countertop has been carved out of the maroon 
coloured sandstone, proving a bit of separation from the patron and the merchant
and provides a small space to layout items to be reviewed for purchase. Due to 
the shallowness of the carving, this post provides almost no protection from the
weather. Behind the counter a small hole can be seen carved into the rock, with 
a wooden door covering it. The brass hinges of the door have been bolted into 
the rock in an attempt to keep it in place and protect whatever is behind it, be
it more wares or personal space.

Within a trading post.
A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy 
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the 
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of 
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted 
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here, 
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent 
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents 
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is 
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this 
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.

Within a trading post.
A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy 
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the 
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of 
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted 
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here, 
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent 
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents 
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is 
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this 
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.
You can view what this shop has for sale using WARES.

Havens of the Touched.
Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal&#39;s plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.

various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal&#39;s plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal&#39;s plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for 
safety. A caterpillar squirms around the ground, looking for fresh foliage to 
eat. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under 
the fallen leaves.
Krax is here.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent.

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the 
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines, 
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of 
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny 
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into 
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the 
clouds.

Western garden path.
The white marble walkway, shot through with azure veins, runs straight east and 
west, where it widens in a gradual outward curve to meet the outer ring of the 
garden. Tall walls of immaculate white stone direct the walkway, following both 
the straight edges and curves. Carved within the walls, visible beneath thick 
tendrils of vegetation that spill over the top, are carved symmetrical patterns 
of complex spirals and curved bands, highlighted by the occasional sharp angle.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the 
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves. 
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the

A path around an isolated garden.
A tall wall of immaculate white stone girds the inner edge of the blue-veined 
marble walkway that is the outer ring of the garden. Carved in the wall are 
complex patterns of knots and spirals, save the very centre in which is 
displayed the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Thick vines, covered in broad, flat 
leaves of green, obscure the walls, masking the arabesque designs. The walkway 
curves away from the sigil northwest and southeast. The southwestern edge of the
outer ring is open to the horizon, revealing only blue sky below and, far above,
through a thin layer of clouds, smudges of brown and red.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for

A path around an isolated garden.
A tall wall of immaculate white stone girds the inner edge of the blue-veined 
marble walkway that is the outer ring of the garden. Carved in the wall are 
complex patterns of knots and spirals, save the very centre in which is 
displayed the sigil of the Jezira Empire. Thick vines, covered in broad, flat 
leaves of green, obscure the walls, masking the arabesque designs. The walkway 
curves away from the sigil northwest and southeast. The southwestern edge of the
outer ring is open to the horizon, revealing only blue sky below and, far above,
through a thin layer of clouds, smudges of brown and red.
You see exits leading to the southeast and northwest.

Southern edge of a garden.
Nought but blue sky borders the southern edge of the wide outer ring of the 
garden. The outer ring is composed of broad seamless marble, white veined with 
azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another 
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner 
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer 
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy 
vines and broad green leaves, spilling out over the tops of the walls, obscures 
the complex arabesque patterns on the walls.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for 
safety. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself 
under the fallen leaves.
You see exits leading to the north, northeast and northwest.

579/904H 825/904M - probe phaser

Small and lightweight, this phaser can easily be wielded with a single hand. 
Metallic in colour, several buttons are conveniently placed to ensure the prompt
and safe changing of settings and quick firing. Resin grips don each side of the
pistol, easing the strain on the hand from constant grip as well as providing a 
barrier between the user and the heat generated from the firing of the gun. Open
sights are placed upon the gun and ensure accuracy when used properly, however 
they appear to be more of a cosmetic addition than placed for constant use.
It appears to have sixty months of usefulness left.
It currently holds 82/248 units of energy.
The power gauge glows a bright yellow.
It weighs about 175jm.

A wide walkway of azure-marbled white stone forms the eastern edge of the ring

white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A 
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty
horizon; beneath the garden is an endless expanse of blue, dotted by the white

in check by nought but the clouds and the horizon. The walls buttressing its 
southern edges, where it runs southeast and northwest, split by a walkway 
leading directly south, are tall white stone, immaculate; carved within those 
walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting 
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling
down from the tops of the walls, attempt to mask the arabesque designs, broad 
leaves claiming further space.

Northern garden path.
Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western 
edges, the walkway widens to the north, curving smoothly outward. Upon the 
walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are 
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting 
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of 
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.
A slimy pile of goo and fuzz is all that remains of a caterpillar.
You see exits leading to the north and south.

North of a waterfall.
The tips of thick, green vines skim the azure-veined white marble of the 
walkway. The vines, upon which grow broad, flat leaves, have burst forth over 
the edge of a high wall bordering the walkway&#39;s eastern and western edges. The 
walls are a pure white stone, in which has been etched symmetrical, geometrical 
patterns of spirals and knots, and smoothly curving and sharply angled bands. 
The southern end of the walkway empties into a marble clearing, the centre of 
which is home to a large waterfall falling endlessly upward.
A slimy pile of goo and fuzz is all that remains of a caterpillar.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for 
safety. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself 
under the fallen leaves.
Krax is here.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall&#39;s ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for 
safety.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent.

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the 
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines, 
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of 
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny 
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into 
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the 
clouds.
A caterpillar squirms around the ground, looking for fresh foliage to eat.
You see exits leading to the east and west.

Western garden path.
The white marble walkway, shot through with azure veins, runs straight east and 
west, where it widens in a gradual outward curve to meet the outer ring of the 
garden. Tall walls of immaculate white stone direct the walkway, following both 
the straight edges and curves. Carved within the walls, visible beneath thick 
tendrils of vegetation that spill over the top, are carved symmetrical patterns 
of complex spirals and curved bands, highlighted by the occasional sharp angle.
A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under the 
fallen leaves.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the 
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves. 
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the 
north.
A caterpillar squirms around the ground, looking for fresh foliage to eat.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.
Four green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete

A landing before a shop.
A ceiling of pearlescent white adobe, radiant in various rainbow hues, covers
the landing at the top of the stairs. Wide pillars of the same adobe support the
ceiling, a repeating pattern of abstract leaf and thick, gentle strokes, curled
and complex, carved into their surface. To the east stands a bare wall with
sliding doors in its centre. Westward, the stairs descend to meet a wide walkway
of adobe, girded by silver metal.
You see exits leading to the east and down.

Before a flight of stairs.
Rising from the north side of the wide walkway are stairs, climbing toward a
wide square building set back against the walkway's outer edge. The ground floor
of the building is wide open, supported by four thick corner beams and enclosed
by a porous lattice of arabesque design. Flowers and plants of all shapes and
colours seek to spill from the lattice, their rainbow petals pushing through.
Thick metal beams form the edges of the walkway as it continues east toward a
steep ramp, and northwest toward a bend. Trees carpet the earth beneath the
walkway, stretching away toward the mountain wall to the north; south they stop
only at the skyline. In the far eastern distance can be made out the tops of
shimmering white buildings.
You see exits leading to the northwest and up.
746/746H 746/746M - nw
A bend in the walkway.
The walkway is built of pearlescent white adobe, set between thick beams of
silver metal. Short walls of the same adobe line the walkway, an ever-repeating
design of swirling leaves and thick, bold lines covering their surface. Along
the top of the wall are tall spires, topped in wide bulbs that thin to sharp
needles. Trees, wide and green, cloak the ground beneath the walkway, growing
north to meet the mountain wall, and stretching south toward the horizon. The
walkway turns to the southeast here, and runs westward toward the distance wall
of a large building.
You see exits leading to the southeast and west.

On a walkway above the trees.
Thick metal beams, running between wide paths of shimmering, multi-hued white
adobe, support the walkway as it spans the tops of wide, green trees below.
Short walls of the same adobe gird the walkway, covered in scrolling designs of
abstract leaves and thick, smoothly curving lines in an ever-repeating pattern.
Tall, thin spires, topped with wide bulbs and sharp needles, sit at regular
intervals along the walls. To the north the trees push up against solid mountain
wall, while to the south they stretch as if to the horizon. The walkway runs
east, where it begins a southward curve, and west, to meet the flat face of a
large white building.
You see exits leading to the east and west.

Before a warehouse.
To the northwest is the tall face of an otherwise nondescript building, composed
of the iridescent adobe, a shimmering white of myriad hues. Set high in the wall
are thin windows, their tops rounded. A sliding door sits in the center of the
building's face. Below the walkway are the tops of wide, short trees, stretching
away in all directions. To the east the adobe walkway, supported by smooth beams
of silver metal, stretches above the tree line; southeast it winds its way
beneath a tall canopy of similar adobe, ending before a squat, square building.

Disappearing into the recesses of the warehouse to the west are a multitude of
tall scaffolds, composed of multiple shelves, each stuffed full of various
supplies. The ceiling is visible only as muted lighting, seeming to converge on
a single point in the far western horizon. Set a short distance in front of
those shelves is a solitary desk, a chair behind it. The desk faces east, toward

A covered walkway.
A high ceiling shades this otherwise open walkway, suspended high above the tops
of wide, green trees. Made from the same adobe as the ceiling, shimmering a
multi-faceted white, tall, square pillars line the edge of the path. An
ever-repeating design of leaves and bold, thick lines, convoluted and complex,
has been shaped into the sides of the pillars. To the northwest the walkway

A flat panel of translucent glass covers the top of the dais in the middle of

electronics of all kinds surround the glass dais, their lights ever lit. The
surrounding room is composed of flat walls of pearlescent adobe, its white
shimmering beneath a veneer of similar glass. The room is spacious, though the
dais occupying its southwestern corner takes up much of its volume. Set in the

Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides

Heavy roots break through the soft soil of the ceiling of this dusky room. Save
for the small patch of ceiling, little is left to remind one of the world
outside the door. The floor is a solidified collection of images: mixed in is
sky and earth, faces, clothing, buildings, and more images too small or too
indistinct to make out. There are no visible walls, instead an endless expanse
of cloudy shades of grey. To the northwest is a rectangle of immaculate white
stone, engraved in which are glowing arabesque patterns: geometrical shapes
composed of thick bands that at times curve gently, and other times take sharp
turns, crossing and coalescing in perfect symmetry in infinitely changing,
infinitely varied modes.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.

A path around an isolated garden.
In the centre of the high wall, its curve southward along the inner rim of the
white and azure marble of the wide walkway, peeking out from behind thick
tendrils of leafy vines, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, proud Elaran
features replicated in uncanny detail. The rest of the wall, stretching away
both northeast and southwest, is a complex collection of crossing curved lines
and sharp-angled knots. Opposite the wall, to the southwest, is only open
horizon. Far above the garden walkways, through a layer of clouds, are the
blurred impressions of various shades of brown.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for
safety. An orchid bulb lies abandoned here. A garden snake slithers along the
ground, attempting to hide itself under the fallen leaves.
You see exits leading to the northeast and southwest.

Southern edge of a garden.
Nought but blue sky borders the southern edge of the wide outer ring of the
garden. The outer ring is composed of broad seamless marble, white veined with
azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy
vines and broad green leaves, spilling out over the tops of the walls, obscures
the complex arabesque patterns on the walls.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for

Southern garden path.
Southward the blue-veined marble walkway widens in smooth curves, meeting a
broad outer ring of the same stone. In a similar manner the high walls
buttressing the walk curve smoothly away, as if opening to the vast horizon.
Half hidden behind the thick vines that spill over the top, intricate patterns
of curving lines, complex knots, and sharp angles are carved into the immaculate
white stone of the wall. The marble walkway runs straight north in addition to
its southward broadening.

High walls of a pure white stone line the walkway as it runs north and south.
Cascading green, thick vines and wide, flat leaves mask the arabesque spirals
and knots carved into the walls. The walkway itself is composed of azure-veined
white stone, one seamless piece. To the north can be seen a large waterfall,
surrounded by a walkable ring of that same marble, its waters flowing steadily
upward.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for
safety. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself
under the fallen leaves.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent.

Small and lightweight, this phaser can easily be wielded with a single hand.
Metallic in colour, several buttons are conveniently placed to ensure the prompt
and safe changing of settings and quick firing. Resin grips don each side of the
pistol, easing the strain on the hand from constant grip as well as providing a
barrier between the user and the heat generated from the firing of the gun. Open
sights are placed upon the gun and ensure accuracy when used properly, however
they appear to be more of a cosmetic addition than placed for constant use.

his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high

Southern edge of a garden.
Nought but blue sky borders the southern edge of the wide outer ring of the
garden. The outer ring is composed of broad seamless marble, white veined with
azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy

Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.

controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved

Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress

Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides

North of a waterfall.
The tips of thick, green vines skim the azure-veined white marble of the
walkway. The vines, upon which grow broad, flat leaves, have burst forth over
the edge of a high wall bordering the walkway's eastern and western edges. The
walls are a pure white stone, in which has been etched symmetrical, geometrical
patterns of spirals and knots, and smoothly curving and sharply angled bands.
The southern end of the walkway empties into a marble clearing, the centre of
which is home to a large waterfall falling endlessly upward.
A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under the

Northern garden path.
Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western
edges, the walkway widens to the north, curving smoothly outward. Upon the
walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira,
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high

smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of

Small and lightweight, this phaser can easily be wielded with a single hand.
Metallic in colour, several buttons are conveniently placed to ensure the prompt
and safe changing of settings and quick firing. Resin grips don each side of the
pistol, easing the strain on the hand from constant grip as well as providing a
barrier between the user and the heat generated from the firing of the gun. Open
sights are placed upon the gun and ensure accuracy when used properly, however
they appear to be more of a cosmetic addition than placed for constant use.

In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira,
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.

Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.

East of a waterfall.
Heavy green vines, overflowing the short white walls to the north and south,
threaten to overtake the marbled stone, having already hidden the high white
walls meant to contain them. Where the vines have not enshrouded the walls can
be seen scroll-work patterns of interlocking spirals and knots, a mix of lazy
curves and acute angles. Forced by the vine-laden walls, the white marble of the

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.

Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.

Heavy green vines, overflowing the short white walls to the north and south,

A wide walkway of azure-marbled white stone forms the eastern edge of the ring
around the garden, curving westward to both the north and south. Directly west
the walk is drawn by inward-facing curves, marked by border high walls of pure
white stone. Complex whorls and knots are carved into the faces of the walls. A
thick tangle of green vines and flat leaves bursts forth above the wall, masking
in places the intricate designs. Beyond the edge of the ring is nought but empty

The Arena Supply Store.
Wooden shelves line the walls of this great metallic building, their surfaces
overflowing with phials of nanites and other assorted goods. A harsh overhead
light illuminates the surroundings and casts sharp pitch shadows through the
chamber.
Four corpses of Visaerisdos lie here haphazardly.

Chairs and tables have been arranged across the checkered floor of this retro

west wall with vintage Slusho glasses sitting stacked to the side. A distinctive
jukebox sits in the northwestern corner of the room with real vinyl records and
an archaic coin slot. A swinging door to the north bears the phrase, "Don't

An outdoor trading shop.
Carved out of a large sandstone rock formation, this trading post is small,
providing just enough room for several patrons to enter and still be within the
carving of the rock. A makeshift countertop has been carved out of the maroon
coloured sandstone, proving a bit of separation from the patron and the merchant
and provides a small space to layout items to be reviewed for purchase. Due to
the shallowness of the carving, this post provides almost no protection from the
weather. Behind the counter a small hole can be seen carved into the rock, with
a wooden door covering it. The brass hinges of the door have been bolted into
the rock in an attempt to keep it in place and protect whatever is behind it, be
it more wares or personal space.

Within a trading post.
A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here,
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.

A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here,
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides

clouds, can be seen a giant golden smudge; below is nought but blue sky. A
curved wall, its apex pointing toward open sky, of immaculate white stone girds
the inner edge of the ring. Complex geometrical shapes, composed of curving

walls are intricate patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, suggesting
various geometric figures as they cross and where they coalesce. Vines, crawling
down from the tops of the walls, attempt to mask the arabesque designs, broad
leaves claiming further space.

his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured

stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently

Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular

a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the

contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this

pistol, easing the strain on the hand from constant grip as well as providing a
barrier between the user and the heat generated from the firing of the gun. Open

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete
access around it. The portal's plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for
safety. A caterpillar squirms around the ground, looking for fresh foliage to
eat. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself under
the fallen leaves.

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the

variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the

The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is

579/904H 825/904M - probe phaser
Small and lightweight, this phaser can easily be wielded with a single hand.
Metallic in colour, several buttons are conveniently placed to ensure the prompt
and safe changing of settings and quick firing. Resin grips don each side of the
pistol, easing the strain on the hand from constant grip as well as providing a
barrier between the user and the heat generated from the firing of the gun. Open
sights are placed upon the gun and ensure accuracy when used properly, however
they appear to be more of a cosmetic addition than placed for constant use.
It appears to have sixty months of usefulness left.
It currently holds 82/248 units of energy.
The power gauge glows a bright yellow.
It weighs about 175jm.

Southern edge of a garden.
Nought but blue sky borders the southern edge of the wide outer ring of the
garden. The outer ring is composed of broad seamless marble, white veined with
azure, curving northward to both the east and west. Directly north is another
marble walkway, encompassed by the same high white walls that border the inner
edge of the ring. The entrance to the northern walk seems drawn from the outer
ring, a smooth inward curve of the walls gradually straitening. A mass of heavy
vines and broad green leaves, spilling out over the tops of the walls, obscures
the complex arabesque patterns on the walls.
You see exits leading to the north, northeast and northwest.

A path around an isolated garden.
In the centre of the high wall, its curve southward along the inner rim of the
white and azure marble of the wide walkway, peeking out from behind thick
tendrils of leafy vines, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, proud Elaran
features replicated in uncanny detail. The rest of the wall, stretching away
both northeast and southwest, is a complex collection of crossing curved lines
and sharp-angled knots. Opposite the wall, to the southwest, is only open
horizon. Far above the garden walkways, through a layer of clouds, are the
blurred impressions of various shades of brown.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for

Northern garden path.
Following the parallels walls of white stone bordering its eastern and western
edges, the walkway widens to the north, curving smoothly outward. Upon the
walls, growing over their tops, are sweeping tendrils of heavy green vines, from
which sprout wide leaves. Beneath those vines, carved into the walls, are
symmetrical patterns of spiraling whorls and sharp angled bands, suggesting
various geometrical shapes in all varieties. The walkway itself is made of
smooth marble, azure veins throughout its white mass.
A slimy pile of goo and fuzz is all that remains of a caterpillar.
You see exits leading to the north and south.

North of a waterfall.
The tips of thick, green vines skim the azure-veined white marble of the
walkway. The vines, upon which grow broad, flat leaves, have burst forth over
the edge of a high wall bordering the walkway's eastern and western edges. The
walls are a pure white stone, in which has been etched symmetrical, geometrical
patterns of spirals and knots, and smoothly curving and sharply angled bands.
The southern end of the walkway empties into a marble clearing, the centre of
which is home to a large waterfall falling endlessly upward.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides
here. A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for
safety. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself
under the fallen leaves.
Krax is here.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
A shimmering waterfall of translucent blue falls upward in a steady torrent.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide,
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines,
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the
clouds.

Western garden path.
The white marble walkway, shot through with azure veins, runs straight east and
west, where it widens in a gradual outward curve to meet the outer ring of the
garden. Tall walls of immaculate white stone direct the walkway, following both
the straight edges and curves. Carved within the walls, visible beneath thick
tendrils of vegetation that spill over the top, are carved symmetrical patterns
of complex spirals and curved bands, highlighted by the occasional sharp angle.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves.
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the
north.

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira,
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.
Four green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for

Havens of the Touched.
Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete
access around it. The portal's plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.
