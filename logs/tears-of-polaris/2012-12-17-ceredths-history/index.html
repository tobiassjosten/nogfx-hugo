I lived with my sister, Ilectra, and 
the other siblings of our family. She was to be wed to a man who disgraced our 
family. As the wedding approached, my life changed for the worse.  I awoke to 
find both my cherished parents, drowned in their own pool of blood. My sisters 
found an unhappy death at the envenoming of their assassins. All except for one;
Ilectra.


Ilectra was not killed, although perceptions can be deceptive. Hers was the 
only body missing. That night I made it my quest to follow her footsteps, and 
somehow find my beloved sister once again. My feet rushed me to the stable as 
quickly as they could. I approached, only to find our fastest horse missing. 
Suddenly, I was filled with a glimmer of hope, that she survived by some mere 
chance. I followed along the tracks until after years of blistering walking and 
exhausted nights. I came upon the inn which changed my life.


They said she had traveled farther down the road to a town named Gahlen, a town
of new beginnings and new dreams. I knew I must stay in the inn, at least until 
my feet were healed. By this time, my feet had charred flesh; the skin had been 
broken and scarred over from many tiring nights. I waited in this inn, drawing 
pictures of how life used to be and how happy we all once were. It was then when 
I realized by talent for craft.


After a few weeks in the tavern, I continued down the path until I stood at the 
gates of Gahlen. I’m sure that you could hear my heartbeat from miles away. I 
was excited; this could be the chance to reunite all that was left of our broken 
family. The ambassador greeted me, and I swore my fealty (A choice a will never 
regret). Soon, I found my way to the merchants, knowing that the life of an 
artist runs deep within our family blood.


There she was, my beautiful sister Ilectra. My life’s quest had been fulfilled. 
As for the rest of my destiny; hopefully the merchants will accept me as one of
their own. I hope my potential can provide a new sense of unity throughout our 
beloved town, and somehow my work can improve Gahlen for the better.">My life starts when I was only a child. I lived with my sister, Ilectra, and
