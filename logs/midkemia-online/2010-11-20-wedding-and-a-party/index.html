The ominous power of the Dark Path sings out to your soul in this forsaken place. There are 4 Moredhel bladedancers here. A dark shrine to the Deceiver is here, made from black smoke which undulates and shifts as it takes the form of a man in many poses. An old hunchbacked woman shuffles about here. An obsidian obelisk stands here, tip just barely touching the ceiling. Olga, the gypsy fortune teller is here, her silver eyes glittering with supressed mirth. Conquest Overlord, Roma, War Troll is here. He wields a war maul in both hands.
You see exits leading down, northwest, southwest, southeast, and northeast.

Radakail arrives from the southeast.
Sappho follows Radakail from the southeast.
Christoff follows Sappho from the southeast.
Murkistad follows Sappho from the southeast.
Zylo follows Sappho from the southeast.

You examine Olga, the fortune teller in the room:
Dressed in a long flowing skirt and a brightly embroidered blouse, Olga is an old lady of indeterminable race, her long hair silver streaked with white. As she moves, a musical sound surrounds her, emitting from the hundreds of silver bells that hem her clothing. The faint scent of lavender and freesias linger around her person, a delicate smell that wafts gently on the breeze around her. Each of her fingers is decorated with a golden ring, several of them with splendid gems that glisten and shine as her hands move. More jewellery rests at her wrists and throat, chains and bangles that gleam and draw the eye. She wears a long coat made from pure white polar-bear fur, the cuffs decorated with silver thread that loops and whirls in a stunning pattern, adding to the rich, though eclectic look she is sporting. Her silver eyes hold a mirthful light as she watches the world move past her.
Olga, the fortune teller appears to be extraordinarily strong.

Look me
She is an alien Valheru and is tall, standing at a few inches over six feet.  Her gracefully lean body is toned and strong, with modest feminine curves. Her smooth skin is an ivory shade, cold but somehow radiant with vitality. A narrow nose is flanked by high, sharp cheekbones, painted in a pale pink flush. Soft lips of a deep rose hue sit above a slightly pointed chin. Large, grey eyes flash eerily, rimmed with long lashes under a delicate brow. Her silky black tresses have been intricately braided about her head, and adorned with glinting obsidian beads. Her elongated, pointed ears have been pierced at the lobes, and she is wearing long, dangling earrings of obsidian and small raven feathers. She is wearing a stunning dress of black silk, an elegantly veiled cap, adorned with feathers, delicate shoes, and a delicate star shaped silver pendant.

Look Radakail
He is a deadly Moredhel elf and is is young for his race, maintaining a youthful exuberance about him and a grin permanently etched into the pale, delicate twist of his lips, sending the smallest of dimples into his thin, hollowed cheeks. The tender flesh of his lips is a deep crimson, starkly contrasting the colouration, or lack thereof, of his gravestone-white cheeks. Long brown hair, normally unkempt and damped from the sweat of activity, has been messily braided to hang about his hears and the sides of his face, several of the longer braids dangling past his angular jaw-line, colourful strips of cloth used to bind the ends in a decorative clash of colour. Small beads of glass clink back and forth as he moves, occasionally announcing his presence with the softest tinkling of glass, often a distraction from his fidgeting digits as they twitch constantly, as if incapable of being still. He is wearing a nightmarish breastplate, wicked, dragon-taloned sabatons, wicked, dragon-mawed greaves, majestic gauntlets of midnight-blue scales, scaled, midnight-blue vambraces, a black half-mask, a snowy bearskin pouch, a dark sable cloak trimmed in snow leopard fur, and a black leather belt.

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Gravis has come over all odd, I have decided to take her place.\"

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"I say come over all odd, but lets face it, she\&#39;s never been all there.\"

You smile softly.

The corners of Tora\&#39;s mouth turn upwards as he smiles sunnily.

Someone smirks, slipping out of the shadows and into the torchlight.

Staring absently at Tiaen, Radakail ponders something.

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Are we all here?\"

(Sar-Sargoth): Radakail says, \"For those who intend to attend, you would do well to join us at Gravis.\"

Zorn fidgets in eagerness.

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"I believe a few more are slow in their attendance.\"

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"Just a few too many hits to the head.\"

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"I understand. Every race has a few defective members.\"

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"With a warhammer..\"

Sappho hugs a blackened warhammer bearing fangs with obvious affection.

The Obelisk of the Dark Tide. (Sar-Sargoth.)
The ominous power of the Dark Path sings out to your soul in this forsaken place. Dark smooth walls glow and undulate from the power of this sacred site deep within the citadel of Sar-Sargoth. A glowing miasma swirls slowly around the room, a dark purple transparent mist that clings to the walls and is slowly drawn towards the tip of the mighty obelisk that stands within the center of the room. On the walls iron sconces hold large flickering torches of an ominous blue color which give off no smoke. There are 4 Moredhel bladedancers here. A dark shrine to the Deceiver is here, made from black smoke which undulates and shifts as it takes the form of a man in many poses. An old hunchbacked woman shuffles about here. An obsidian obelisk stands here, tip just barely touching the ceiling. Olga, the gypsy fortune teller is here, her silver eyes glittering with supressed mirth. Fledgling Imma is here. Tora is here, surrounded by a golden nimbus of light. He wields a repair hammer in his left hand. Dragon Champion Iphimedia Serpentis, The Iron Tongue is here.

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"This it?\"

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"So it would seem.\"

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Then all of you, shush, and we shall begin.\"

Sappho listens intently.

Clenching the hilt of his cruel blade, a Moredhel Bladedancer departs northeast.

The lights dim, the room becoming darker, the shadows deeper.

Clenching the hilt of his cruel blade, a Moredhel Bladedancer departs northeast.

Sappho recites a fiery liturgy praising the divine glories of Prandur, God of Fire, her eyes burning with conviction.

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"We are here today, to celebrate the joining of two leaders of the Moredhel.\"

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Will the couple step forwards, and present your credentials?\"

Olga, the fortune teller points her finger at Radakail.

Zorn blinks.

Radakail takes several steps forward, separating himself from the crowd, a dark, draconic helm underneath his arm.

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"I am the Witch-King of the Northlands, Radakail.\"

Olga, the fortune teller points directly at you.

Rhiarinn walks quietly forward to stand beside Radakail, saying, \"I am Grand Chieftain of Raven, and Praetor of Sar-Sargoth, Rhiarinn.\"

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"There are few as powerful as these two, and with their marriage, a clan grows stronger, a people greater, links of power, interwoven.\"

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Radakail, what do you offer Rhiarinn in this marriage?\"

Radakail turns his head to Rhiarinn, gazing at her quietly for a long moment before looking back to Olga, the fortune teller.

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"I offer her security, and power. Where she once stood alone, she now stands beside me. I have given her much, and taught her to take even more.\"

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Rhiarinn, what do you give Radakail in this marriage?\"

Rhiarinn returns the gaze to Radakail before replying, towards Olga, \"I give him my complete devotion, my word of honor, to support his throne and the People.\"

Jumping out from the shadows, a cellar goblin snatches up a rat, stuffing the still squirming creature into his mouth before running away to hunt more.

Murkistad blinks.

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Then let this day see power delivered to the people, to the city and to the clans. What today I join, let none tear assunder.\"

Zorn nods his head emphatically.

A howling echoes around the city of Sar-Sargoth, a pained sound that lingers.

Zorn looks around listening.

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"It is done.\"

Iphimedia speaks a single Word of Blessing to Radakail, who suddenly appears more impressive.

An angry red glow briefly fills Radakail\&#39;s eyes.

Zorn dances happily.

You draw deeply upon the lingering power of the Valheru Dragon Lords, filling your mind with a rush of elation and chaotic images of destruction and death.

Christoff Tharakan, Cardinal of Fire says, \"All hail Rhiarinn. All hail the Witch-King.\"

Murkistad smiles softly at the new couple.

Sappho cheers wildly!

Mallaidh says, \"Congratulations! Radakail and Rhiarinn!\"

You see Zorn the Thorn yell, \"All hail the royal couple!\"

Tora smiles and says, \"Congratulations!\"

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"My thanks to each of you. This day, we see not only Clan Raven grow stronger, but the People. With many of you at my side, I have bested beast and army.\"
A loud bellow of rage echoes around the city.

Zorn nods his head emphatically.

You see Sappho\&#39;s ears perk up suddenly as they look interested once again.

An ancient red dragon shouts, \"This cannot be!\"

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"I have taken fortress and I have slain dragons. We have triumphed, where greater numbers have failed.\"

Zorn shivers suddenly.

Tora blinks.

Roma wields a war maul in both hands.

Vahir cheers wildly!

Zorn wields a wire-hilted rapier in his left hand.

Sappho looks absent, apparently pondering something.

Tora\&#39;s eyes shift from side to side suspiciously.

Zorn the Thorn says in Eledhel, \"Hahah.\"

Radakail draws his lips thin, his gaze shifting upwards towards the ceiling.

Zorn twirls a dagger in anticipation.

An ancient red dragon yells, \"I have come.\"

Zorn the Thorn says in Eledhel, \"Here we go!\"

Zorn jumps into the air.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says in Eledhel, \"Wait.\"

Rhiarinn tilts her head, then looks back to Radakail, dropping into a graceful kneel, the Runeblade held before her.

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"And so it draws close.\"

Mallaidh says, \"Why does it?\"

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"Seems little.. civil for the red-dragon.\"

Zorn falls into the ground face first.

Radakail turns to Rhiarinn, nodding slowly.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"Might I offer to go and.. talk to it? I might be stupid..\"

You say, \"My liege, True King of the lands, my wedding gift to you.\"

Radakail reaches out his hand, grasping the Runeblade by its hilt. \"I accept this, willingly.\"

You give an ancient, ivory-and-gold hilted runeblade to Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North.

Radakail wields an ancient, ivory-and-gold hilted runeblade in both hands.

Radakail smiles thinly down at Rhiarinn, gesturing with one hand for her to stand.

Radakail unwields an ancient, ivory-and-gold hilted runeblade.

Radakail wields a blackened, nightmarish war maul in both hands.

Rhiarinn rises to her feet, face calm.

Atlas Zuhayir, Falcon of Kesh says, \"In the hall, just south of here.\"

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"For this fight, I shall fight with my maul.\"

Radakail chuckles heartily.

With a flap of powerful wings, an ancient red dragon flies in and lands heavily on the ground.

<insert lots of fighting of the dragon>

Stepping forward, Atlas uncoils his body, thrusting a forward-curving Keshian saber into an ancient red dragon\&#39;s chest.
An ancient red dragon gasps in pain as the blade pierces her heart.
An ancient red dragon has been slain by Atlas.
A bellow echoes from the top of the world as an ancient red wyrm meets her demise.
A large pile of glittering coins spill from the corpse.


The corners of Atlas\&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

Sappho pants like a dog.

Radakail smirks with satisfaction.

Christoff pats Sappho, a look of mock concern on his face.

Zorn the Thorn says in Eledhel, \"What happened.\"

Tora says, \"Is it dead?\"

Christoff points his finger at the corpse of an ancient red dragon.

Sappho nods her head emphatically.

You say, \"It is.\"

Dragon Champion Iphimedia Serpentis, The Iron Tongue says, \"It is.\"

The corners of Tora\&#39;s mouth turn upwards as he smiles sunnily.

You say, \"Zuhayir struck the final blow.\"

Comprehension flashes across Tora\&#39;s face.

Atlas bows his head respectfully.

Zorn the Thorn says in Eledhel, \"Good.\"

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Valheru, \"Mmm...\"

Lims-Kragma, the Mistress of Death has bestowed Her divine truefavor upon you. It will last for 3 days.

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Valheru, \"Dragon\&#39;s blood.\"

Radakail breaks into hearty laughter.

Zorn shivers suddenly.

Look Radakail
He is an alien Valheru and is wholly lacking in either the desire or ability to control the slight twist of disgust set into his features. Warmth is absent in his tall, powerful form, pale, the delicately twisted lips set between hollowed cheeks, beneath eyes feverishly burn with a perverse sense of amusement. The tender flesh of his lips is an almost corpse-blue color, set against the rich, browned tone of his deeply tanned skin. Long locks of dark brown hair, silky smooth and flowing, frame his facial features as they rest upon his shoulders and back. His angular jaw-line, set hard as though he were enduring some foul-tasting substance set against his tongue. Powerful limbs frame an equally powerful body, one that is often found in a state of unrest - fidgets, slight tics, a tendency to pace and habitual fixations all pushing him into a constant display of action. He is wearing a nightmarish breastplate, wicked, dragon-taloned sabatons, wicked, dragon-mawed greaves, majestic gauntlets of midnight-blue scales, scaled, midnight-blue vambraces, a black half-mask, a dark sable cloak trimmed in snow leopard fur, a black leather belt, and a snowy bearskin pouch. He walks with the truefavor of Lims-Kragma.

Atlas Zuhayir, Falcon of Kesh says to Christoff, \"The Dragon, Christoff.\"

Sappho looks absent, apparently pondering something.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"One sec.\"

Sappho pokes Christoff.

Christoff Tharakan, Cardinal of Fire says to Atlas, \"Huh?\"

Zorn looks at the corpse of an ancient red dragon in the arms of Christoff.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says to Christoff, \"Give Atlas his dragon?\"

Sappho smiles wryly, clearly quite amused.

Christoff drops the corpse of an ancient red dragon.

(Sar-Sargoth): Radakail says, \"Well done, to each of you.\"

Dragon Champion Iphimedia Serpentis, The Iron Tongue says, \"I would not say it is his.\"

Mallaidh says, \"Indeed.\"

\&#39;Oops!\&#39;, Christoff exclaims.

\"Haha!\" Christoff laughs.

You nod your head slowly.

Mallaidh says, \"I would.\"

(Novices): Errunx says, \"I didn\&#39;t want to interrupt but if I see a dragon passing the gates should I tell someone?\"

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"And up it on display?\"

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"Just give him the corpse of the beast and call it a day.\"

Radakail breaks into hearty laughter.

Iphimedia dusts herself off.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"Put, sorry.\"

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"It will rot soon enough.\"

Christoff snickers softly.

Iphimedia points her finger at the corpse of an ancient red dragon.

Sappho picks up the corpse of an ancient red dragon.

\"Haha!\" Christoff laughs at Sappho.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"Atlas?\"

Atlas pokes Sappho.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"Want your dragon?\"

You say, \"Perhaps we can have it roasted.\"

Radakail chuckles heartily.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"Come out of the shadows?\"

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom gives the corpse of an ancient red dragon to Atlas Zuhayir, Falcon of Kesh.

Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"And dragon steaks made?\"

Zorn the Thorn says, \"Dragon steaks.\"

Sappho smiles wryly, clearly quite amused.

Christoff snickers at you.

You nod toward Radakail.

Sappho gapes in amazement.

Radakail chuckles heartily.

Herald Sappho, The Flaming Crusader of Doom says, \"Red, dragon-skin robes?\"

Dragon Champion Iphimedia Serpentis, The Iron Tongue says, \"I do like steaks.\"

Apprentice Adept, Murkistad, Initiate of Mysteries says to you, \"May I give you a gift?\"

You say to Murkistad, \"You may.\"

You show off a silver mask:
Filigreed silver wire has been used to form this delicate mask. The wire arches daintily from the temples, above the brow-line and down the sides of the wearers nose, forming a beautiful nose-guard effect. More silver is used to form the outline of the mask, sweeping just below the cheekbones and nearly joining itself at the temples before curving downwards and swirling in on itself. Delicate vines and leaves fill the empty space within the mask, leaving perfect almond shaped openings to frame the wearer\&#39;s eyes. Placed just above these openings are exquisitely formed moonstones. Additional moonstones cut to the shape of simple flowers and holding small diamond chips line the outermost edges of the mask, while a string of small diamonds wind their way up the arch of the nose, ending in one large upside-down tear-shaped diamond.

Suzie, the curvaceous bar wench takes a cloth and begins to wipe down tables.
Fledgling Neefa says, \"Some of dem are in da mead, too.\"

Neefa shows off a battered mug of rat mead:
A thick tankard, made of tarnished and battered tin has been filled with a noxious brew. The faint scent of honey lingers in the golden liquid, but the overtone of dead rat conceals the more pleasing odor. A thin tail has been left hanging out of the mug, allowing the drinker to have a little nibble. Stamped into the side of the mug is the symbol of the Goblin and the Maiden.

The ominous power of the Dark Path sings out to your soul in this forsaken place. There are 4 Moredhel bladedancers here. A dark shrine to the Deceiver is here, made from black smoke which undulates and shifts as it takes the form of a man in many poses. An old hunchbacked woman shuffles about here. An obsidian obelisk stands here, tip just barely touching the ceiling. Olga, the gypsy fortune teller is here, her silver eyes glittering with supressed mirth. Conquest Overlord, Roma, War Troll is here. He wields a war maul in both hands.

Zylo follows Sappho from the southeast.
You examine Olga, the fortune teller in the room:
Dressed in a long flowing skirt and a brightly embroidered blouse, Olga is an old lady of indeterminable race, her long hair silver streaked with white. As she moves, a musical sound surrounds her, emitting from the hundreds of silver bells that hem her clothing. The faint scent of lavender and freesias linger around her person, a delicate smell that wafts gently on the breeze around her. Each of her fingers is decorated with a golden ring, several of them with splendid gems that glisten and shine as her hands move. More jewellery rests at her wrists and throat, chains and bangles that gleam and draw the eye. She wears a long coat made from pure white polar-bear fur, the cuffs decorated with silver thread that loops and whirls in a stunning pattern, adding to the rich, though eclectic look she is sporting. Her silver eyes hold a mirthful light as she watches the world move past her.
Olga, the fortune teller appears to be extraordinarily strong.
Look me
She is an alien Valheru and is tall, standing at a few inches over six feet. Her gracefully lean body is toned and strong, with modest feminine curves. Her smooth skin is an ivory shade, cold but somehow radiant with vitality. A narrow nose is flanked by high, sharp cheekbones, painted in a pale pink flush. Soft lips of a deep rose hue sit above a slightly pointed chin. Large, grey eyes flash eerily, rimmed with long lashes under a delicate brow. Her silky black tresses have been intricately braided about her head, and adorned with glinting obsidian beads. Her elongated, pointed ears have been pierced at the lobes, and she is wearing long, dangling earrings of obsidian and small raven feathers. She is wearing a stunning dress of black silk, an elegantly veiled cap, adorned with feathers, delicate shoes, and a delicate star shaped silver pendant.
Look Radakail
He is a deadly Moredhel elf and is is young for his race, maintaining a youthful exuberance about him and a grin permanently etched into the pale, delicate twist of his lips, sending the smallest of dimples into his thin, hollowed cheeks. The tender flesh of his lips is a deep crimson, starkly contrasting the colouration, or lack thereof, of his gravestone-white cheeks. Long brown hair, normally unkempt and damped from the sweat of activity, has been messily braided to hang about his hears and the sides of his face, several of the longer braids dangling past his angular jaw-line, colourful strips of cloth used to bind the ends in a decorative clash of colour. Small beads of glass clink back and forth as he moves, occasionally announcing his presence with the softest tinkling of glass, often a distraction from his fidgeting digits as they twitch constantly, as if incapable of being still. He is wearing a nightmarish breastplate, wicked, dragon-taloned sabatons, wicked, dragon-mawed greaves, majestic gauntlets of midnight-blue scales, scaled, midnight-blue vambraces, a black half-mask, a snowy bearskin pouch, a dark sable cloak trimmed in snow leopard fur, and a black leather belt.

The Obelisk of the Dark Tide. (Sar-Sargoth.)
The ominous power of the Dark Path sings out to your soul in this forsaken place. Dark smooth walls glow and undulate from the power of this sacred site deep within the citadel of Sar-Sargoth. A glowing miasma swirls slowly around the room, a dark purple transparent mist that clings to the walls and is slowly drawn towards the tip of the mighty obelisk that stands within the center of the room. On the walls iron sconces hold large flickering torches of an ominous blue color which give off no smoke. There are 4 Moredhel bladedancers here.

Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"There are few as powerful as these two, and with their marriage, a clan grows stronger, a people greater, links of power, interwoven.\"
Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Radakail, what do you offer Rhiarinn in this marriage?\"
Radakail turns his head to Rhiarinn, gazing at her quietly for a long moment before looking back to Olga, the fortune teller.
Lord Radakail, Witch-King of the North says, \"I offer her security, and power. Where she once stood alone, she now stands beside me. I have given her much, and taught her to take even more.\"
Olga, the fortune teller says in Common, \"Rhiarinn, what do you give Radakail in this marriage?\"
Rhiarinn returns the gaze to Radakail before replying, towards Olga, \"I give him my complete devotion, my word of honor, to support his throne and the People.\"

Radakail breaks into hearty laughter.
Zorn shivers suddenly.
Look Radakail
He is an alien Valheru and is wholly lacking in either the desire or ability to control the slight twist of disgust set into his features. Warmth is absent in his tall, powerful form, pale, the delicately twisted lips set between hollowed cheeks, beneath eyes feverishly burn with a perverse sense of amusement. The tender flesh of his lips is an almost corpse-blue color, set against the rich, browned tone of his deeply tanned skin. Long locks of dark brown hair, silky smooth and flowing, frame his facial features as they rest upon his shoulders and back. His angular jaw-line, set hard as though he were enduring some foul-tasting substance set against his tongue. Powerful limbs frame an equally powerful body, one that is often found in a state of unrest - fidgets, slight tics, a tendency to pace and habitual fixations all pushing him into a constant display of action. He is wearing a nightmarish breastplate, wicked, dragon-taloned sabatons, wicked, dragon-mawed greaves, majestic gauntlets of midnight-blue scales, scaled, midnight-blue vambraces, a black half-mask, a dark sable cloak trimmed in snow leopard fur, a black leather belt, and a snowy bearskin pouch. He walks with the truefavor of Lims-Kragma.
