You greet Rob the fisherman with a warm smile.
Rob the fisherman says, "This can be a dangerous place, but a great location to fish. Would be 
better if I had fresh bait."

You say to Rob the fisherman, "Bait?"

You say, "I have bait."

You say, "Do you like to fish?"

You pat Rob the fisherman, a look of mock concern on your face.

You say to Rob the fisherman, "It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m usually quiet, myself."

Rob the fisherman places a piece of bait on his rod before casting it into the nearby river.

You grin mischievously at Rob the fisherman.

You say to Rob the fisherman, "Maybe your wife is just expecting you to bring food home, or else, 
you&#39;ll get beaten..."

You say to Rob the fisherman, "I understand you don&#39;t want to talk about it... You&#39;re afraid.
"

You nod your head slowly.

Rob the fisherman places a piece of bait on his rod before casting it into the nearby river.

You say to Rob the fisherman, "Should I feel bad for stealing your fish?"

You purse your lips in contemplation.

Dressed in plain and hard wearing clothing, Rob ignores the world around him as he fishes. At his 
belt is a collection of feathers, sparkling objects and small hooks. His face is weatherworn and 
leathery, but a content smile curves his lips, showing uneven teeth.
Rob the fisherman is quite powerful.
He weighs about 187 pounds.

You say to Rob the fisherman, "It&#39;s okay. Even though I get some of your fish, I&#39;ll pay you a visit 
once in a while! what do you say?"

You frown and say to Rob the fisherman, "No? Oh, okay... I understand, your wife and such... 
Wouldn&#39;t be appropriate."

You nod your head slowly.

Rob the fisherman places a piece of bait on his rod before casting it into the nearby river.

You quickly reel in a common carp-fish, landing it with ease! It looks to weigh 31 pounds.

You say to Rob the fisherman, "It&#39;s just that I feel lonely sometimes... We could be each other&#39;s 
company! Your wife won&#39;t know, I promise!"

You tug on Rob the fisherman.

Making no sudden movements, Rob the fisherman backs away from you slowly.

You crease your brow and frown.

Rob the fisherman says, "Woah there, little elf lass! My wife&#39;d not be pleased to hear those 
words!"

You say to Rob the fisherman, "Oh, fisherman, but...! Your wife won&#39;t be pleased because she won&#39;t 
even know about it!"

Rob the fisherman looks absent, apparently pondering something.

Rob the fisherman says, "But... but... I&#39;m a faithful man, young lady!"

Rob the fisherman gulps nervously.

You look at Rob the fisherman with pursed lips, contemplating your reason for being here.

You say to Rob the fisherman, "But... Don&#39;t you feel lonely sometimes?"

You reel the fishing line in completely.

Rob the fisherman says, "Well, well, a man can get lonely fishing by himself, but that doesn&#39;t mean 
he&#39;s not honorable!"

Rob the fisherman looks around nervously to see if anyone is listening.

You nod your head slowly at Rob the fisherman.

Rob the fisherman says, "Though you are such a fine young lass!"

You frown and say, "I understand... At least tell me your name?"

Rob the fisherman says, "Oh, gods help this poor fool!"

Rob the fisherman says, "Rob, my lady, the name&#39;s Rob."

You say to Rob the fisherman, "Pleased to meet you Rob! I am Abijah."

Rob the fisherman looks a little worried and gulps.

Rob the fisherman says, "P-p-pleased to meet you, Abijah."

You smile and say, "For an instant I thought you had no interest in me... But I see now it is just a 
matter of honor!"

Rob the fisherman says, "I- I suppose there&#39;s no harm in keeping a lovely young lady company ...is 
there?"

Rob the fisherman rubs his brow, dabbing away beads of sweat.

You say to Rob the fisherman, "I guess there isn&#39;t!"

You giggle with delight.

Rob the fisherman says, "I, ahh, I..."

You tilt your head towards Rob the fisherman, listening intently.

Rob the fisherman looks bashfully down at his shoes.

You urge Rob the fisherman onwards.

You say, "Go on, tell me!"

Rob the fisherman says, "I know a quiet place where I might keep a lovely young lady such as 
yourself ...company ...if you were interested."

Rob the fisherman looks a little worried and gulps.

You say, "Oh?"

Rob the fisherman says, "Y-y-yes, my lady! It&#39;s a quiet nook just to the northwest where I often 
relax."

Rob the fisherman places a piece of bait on his rod before casting it into the nearby river.


You flash a smile at Rob the fisherman.

You say, "I&#39;d like to meet that place..."

Rob the fisherman flashes a smile at you.

Rob the fisherman says, "I&#39;d like that too, m-m-my lady! Let me pack up my bags, and I&#39;ll meet you 
right there!"

Rob the fisherman reels in his line and begins packing his belongings.

You nod your head emphatically.


You hear a rustling from the quiet glade to the north.

A painted pony follows you north.

A quiet nook.
The bright sun shines down upon you, filling you with its life-giving warmth. A furious fisherman&#39;s 
wife stands here, hands planted firmly on her hips, and a rolling pin in one hand. Tossing its multi-
colored mane, a painted pony frolics here.
You see a single exit leading south.

"Eep!" you scream in fright.

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "Do you take me for a fool, you hussy?!"

You say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife, "Pardon, Lady! I didn&#39;t mean to disturb you!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "I thought you elves had honor, I did!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "But tryin&#39; to seduce a married woman&#39;s man, that don&#39;t seem so 
honorable to me!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "Especially while he&#39;s laborin&#39; to feed his family!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife glares angrily at you.

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "&#39;ol Rob, he thought he could pull a sly one on me, did he? Oh no, 
I&#39;m no fool, I&#39;m not!"

You say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife, "Oh! Hrm...! My appologies, lady! I was just lonely...
"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "Aye, go an&#39; be lonely with one &#39;o your people, ya 
harridan!"

You say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife, "It&#39;s all my fault! Rob has no guilt in that...
"
A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "That Rob will rue the day he even so much as took a look at ya, he 
will!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife frowns and shakes her fist angrily.

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "We&#39;ll see about that, we will!"

"Hmph!" a furious fisherman&#39;s wife snorts indignantly at you.

You say, "Please! Don&#39;t put Rob in it... I was the one approaching him..."

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "Hmph, an&#39; pigs can fly!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "Now off with ye, b&#39;fore I lose my temper!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife waves her rolling pin threateningly in the air.

You crease your brow and frown.

A painted pony follows you south.

You hear a loud thump and an "Owww!" from the river bank just south of here.

A painted pony follows you east.

You say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife, "Please Lady... What can I do to amend my 
acts?"

You frown and say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife, "Don&#39;t beat him..."

You say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife, "I have plenty of fish! I am sure I could spare some to feed 
your family for some time..."

Dressed in a simple homespun skirt and blouse, this middle aged woman looks healthy, and large. Her 
simple homespun outfit is clean and well tended with no patches or wear marks. Her long hair is tied 
up in a bun, covered in a netting. Around her waist she wears a white apron, stained with blood and 
dirt from cooking and cleaning.
A furious fisherman&#39;s wife is not one to be trifled with.
She weighs about 150 pounds.

You say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife, "Please, kind woman... I feel really sorry for having
