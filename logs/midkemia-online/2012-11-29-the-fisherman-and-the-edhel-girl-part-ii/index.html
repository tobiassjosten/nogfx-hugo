Sheriff Nemi says in the Kingdom Tongue, "I&#39;ll see you around!"

Nemi steps backwards into the shadows and vanishes.

You nod your head emphatically.

You smile and say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "Well, that&#39;s my life."

You shrug helplessly.

You look undecided and say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "How are you, 
anyway? Uh... Do you happen to know Rob?"

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "I may have heard of him, possibly."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Why?"

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "He&#39;s having a hard time with his 
wife because of me..."

You furrow your brow.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Ah, poor ol&#39; Rob."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman snickers softly.

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Just wondering if I can turn it back... I&#39;ve been offering his wife 
some fishes for them."

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "But she&#39;s still mad."

You crease your brow and frown.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "With you or with Rob?"

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "I guess it&#39;s with both, actually."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman smiles and says, "That makes sense, doesn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t think a couple 
of fishes will make up for what you broke sweetheart."

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "It&#39;s been like that for almost a year..."

You let out a deep sigh.

Murkistad arrives from the northwest.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman takes some fish from Murkistad before handing over some coins and a 
receipt in return.
Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Let&#39;s see, 2 bluefin tunas and 6 speckled goliath groupers is 
it? Alright, there&#39;s your receipt and coins, run along now, I&#39;ve got some fish to gut."

Murkistad puts some kingdom coins in a simple backpack.

Murkistad places a hand on forehead and heart.

You bow respectfully to Murkistad.

The corners of Herman Pequod, the Fisherman&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

Murkistad asks, "Rift home..?"

Murkistad says, "Or anywhere else for that matter."

Murkistad blinks.

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "Then what should I 
do?"

Murkistad says to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman, "Greetings, Herman."

You say to Murkistad in the Kingdom Tongue, "I am well, thank you!"

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "You fancy people with your fancy rifts. Why not walk for a 
bit?"

Rather uncertainly, Murkistad utters "uh...".

You giggle with delight.

Murkistad looks down at his legs.

Murkistad says, "I&#39;m not as lithe as I used to be."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says to you, "I don&#39;t know, you should have left him alone in the first 
place I suppose!"

Murkistad pats his belly.

You say to Murkistad in the Kingdom Tongue, "He&#39;s right at a certain point."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says to you, "So tell me, you seduced him yeah?"

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "It was a child thing! Very girlish 
and stupid... I want to amend it."

Murkistad walks over toward the lake and pretends to be paying attention to something in the water, 
but his left ear perks up a bit as he listens on.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says to you, "How exactly did you manage to do that? Most men I know 
aren&#39;t that bold to go walk of with the first girl with a pretty face."

You gasp in surprise at Herman Pequod, the Fisherman.

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Well... I have my... gifts!"

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "And Rob&#39;s just... a fisherman."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Yes love, you do. I can see both of them very clearly. But the 
point is ... fishermen wives are a pain to handle once you got them upset."

You have emoted: Abijah shifts her gaze, awkwardly.

You nod your head slowly at Herman Pequod, the Fisherman.

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "I can see that now..."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Which is the precise reason why most fishermen will stay put 
when tempted by a .. better offer than they currently have sitting at home."

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "I guess you know their wifes better 
than me, that&#39;s why I am asking for advice..."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Right, advice. Pay attention &#39;cause this&#39;d be the best advice I 
can give you."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "When you meat a fisherman, steer clear of his wife. Make sure 
she doesn&#39;t catch you."

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "It is not that I wanted something grand from Rob, I just felt like 
having a giggle out of him. I know it is wrong now..."

You crease your brow and frown.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Advice number 2, to accomplish advice number one, steer clear of 
fisherman."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "That clear?"

You nod your head slowly at Herman Pequod, the Fisherman.

Murkistad rubs his chin thoughtfully.

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "I won&#39;t mess with fishermen anymore..
. But what about amending my acts with that woman? Any possibility?"

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Hmm. That&#39;s a tough nut to crack sweety."

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "I can say so, myself!"

You purse your lips in contemplation.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Let&#39;s see, what would you do if your husband would be snatched 
by a way younger-and-better-looking girl? Would you forgive her because she brings you a couple of 
fishes?"

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "Is there anything that fishermen 
wives love more than anything else?"

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman rubs his chin thoughtfully.

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "Uuuh... I guess I wouldn&#39;t... You 
are right."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Well, given the fact that her husband is a fisherman, I think 
she has plenty of fish already."

Expressing the full depth of your uncertainty, you utter "uh...".

You place your face in your palm and shake your head in utter frustration.

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Intelligence is not one of my best virtues."

Murkistad smiles impishly and says, "Maybe we can give her the sweet release of 
death?"

Murkistad smirks with satisfaction.

You suspiciously eye Murkistad.

Murkistad says, "Only joking, of course."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Look, I don&#39;t think I am the right person to ask this in the 
first place. I cannot seem to please my wife, let alone help you with this situation. Which you 
created all by yourself in the first place."

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "Hrm... Do you happen to know anyone 
better to help me?"

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "You don&#39;t really know much about fishermen and their wifes, do 
you?"

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "Of course I&#39;d owe said person, it is 
not that I go around and ask for free advice."

Murkistad whispers, "Excuse me.. I&#39;m sorry to have.. interjected."

You nod your head sagely.

Murkistad weaves his hands and chants as ethereal gray mists swirl in the air.

Murkistad makes a splitting motion and a shimmering Rift suddenly forms in the air, surrounded by 
swirling gray fog.

Murkistad&#39;s hands glow blue as he draws on wild, cosmic magic.

Murkistad places a hand on forehead and heart.

Murkistad steps through a shimmering Rift.

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "No, not really... Fisherman is not 
my strong, as you can say."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Well, your a missy yourself, aren&#39;t you? What cheers you 
up?"

A shimmering Rift swirls and collapses inward.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "What mighty gift would make YOU forgive the aforementioned 
better-looking girl?"

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Flowers... Hmm, plushies... But I am far more younger than 
her!"

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "That&#39;s it? flowers and plushies?"

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "What would make me forget... I&#39;d probably wanted a gift from my 
husband instead of said girl..."

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Maybe I am doing it wrongly... Maybe I should help Rob with his 
forgiveness, instead of mine... But she never leaves his sight anymore."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Exactly, but as I understand, poor Rob is currently having his 
ways checked pretty badly, right?"

You nod your head emphatically.

You crease your brow and frown.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Anyway, been good talking to you. Need to attend my business 
again!"

You nod your head emphatically.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "Best advice I can give you though, you do what we do, ignore her.
"

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman winks at you.

You say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "Apologies for taking your time... 
And you&#39;ve been doing a great job!"

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman flashes a smile at you.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "That&#39;s one sexy hammer, I might add."

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman nods his head sagely.

You giggle with delight.

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Thank you!"

You curtsey respectfully before Herman Pequod, the Fisherman.

Herman Pequod, the Fisherman doffs his hat cordially.

You peer suspiciously at a silver Hammer of War.

Completely made of blessed silver, this warhammer emits a faint glow from within itself. The handle 
of the hammer is inlaid with yellow gold runes, which emphasizes the mystical nature of the weapon. 
The blunt part of the head is engraved with the distinctive marks of Tith-Onanka, the God of War and 
the Sect of Triumph.
It has 993 Midkemian days of usefulness left.
It weighs about 15 pounds.
It is in pristine condition.

You wield a silver Hammer of War in both hands.

Abijah looks up at the sky, murmuring "Thank you, Joyful Warrior!" 

A voice booms in your head "You are welcome, Abijah".'>You hug Nemi affectionately.
Sheriff Nemi says in the Kingdom Tongue, "I'll see you around!"
Nemi steps backwards into the shadows and vanishes.
You nod your head emphatically.
You smile and say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "Well, that's my life."
You shrug helplessly.
You look undecided and say to Herman Pequod, the Fisherman in the Kingdom Tongue, "How are you,
anyway? Uh... Do you happen to know Rob?"
Herman Pequod, the Fisherman says, "I may have heard of him, possibly."
