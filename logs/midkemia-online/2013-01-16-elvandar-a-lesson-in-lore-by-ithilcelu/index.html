The pungent smell of tabac mixes graciously with the sweet smell of mead and ale in this cramped alehouse. The walls are crafted from thickly hewed logs lashed together with a strong rope, and the occasional gust of wind intrudes through the small gaps in the wood and washes the sometimes stale odors out. A low counter hosts an array of bottles and heavy casks of ale are semi-hidden behind the makeshift bar. One large window in the southern wall allows a restricted view of the city outside, although a large bush 
obscures all bar the largest of trees in the distance. A heavy burgundy curtain rests on a wooden rail, separating this small bar from another room to the east. Moving silently about behind the bar, Baklav the barman is here. There is a simple doorway here, tiny silver fragments glinting and catching your eye. There are 3 wooden stools here. Lips pursed as she surveys the area, Vashnim the Busybody listens to all as she casually knits in the corner. There is a fireplace here. Hanging here are festive green and gold streamers. Sir Arke Len&#39;Rathi, Paladin of the Oak is sitting on a wooden stool. He wields a simple forestal ax in his right hand. Ithilcelu is here, surrounded by a golden nimbus of light. She wields a gilded design book in her left hand. Zacc is here, surrounded by a golden nimbus of light. He wields a sinuous kris inscribed with runic script in his left hand. You see a sign instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading west (open door) and southeast.


Ithilcelu closes her eyes and centers herself, thinking back through the stories of the People before she begins in a soft, yet carrying voice "When the world was young and filled with only the People, and the Dragons we were one." As she speaks, her words bring forth a picture of a land untouched, images of edhel traveling through forest and desert alike. "Then, the peace of our lands was broken, mighty beings came to our home and took it for their own." 

Port Natal has been captured by the Forest of Elvandar!

A fireplace continues to burn brightly, bathing the area in a warm glow.

The ribald melody of the Maiden&#39;s Caress ends with a flourish.

Ithilcelu lifts her face, her eyes opening to reveal a soft sadness within them. "The Valheru took the land by force, and shackled us as surely as if they had placed metal bands upon our limbs. Sorting through us, they took those who had the most skill with magic as their lorekeepers, and split the rest of us into two groups, the houseslaves and the tenders of the wild." 

Ithilcelu&#39;s voice drops carrying with it the pain of a people enslaved and split apart, "Over time, they bred us to fit their needs more perfectly and as ages past by we who are now the Eledhel grew closer to the land than ever we had been before. Our souls as intermingled with the heartbeat of life as they are with our true mates." Lifting her hand she casts an illusion of an underground palace, "and those who we now call our cousins grew close to the Valheru, as houseslaves they were pulled from the natural rythms." 

Ithilcelu says, "Creation and destruction, the first gods, faded from view and as the threads they wove fell, the gods that the humans worship grew into being. The Valheru, feeling the touch of a power that could rival their own filled with joy of battle and bloodlust, rushing off to kill those who could challenge their claim."

A fireplace continues to burn brightly, bathing the area in a warm glow.

Ithilcelu&#39;s words are hushed as she continues, "The world was turned upside down, where once there had been land, there was now water, once air, fire." The illusion shifts once more, innumerable edhel rushing together towards a patch of forest "The eldar, the magical lorekeepers joined together with the strongest of magic users among the gardeners and cast the most powerful warding spells they could to protect the people."

Zacc listens intently.

Arianai&#39;s eyes narrow a little, pushing her bangs behind her ear, squeezing a long and gracefully thin swan-lyre to her chest. 

Ithilcelu shifts the illusion once more, the view pulling back to show a glimps of the calm within Elvandar before rushing further outwards to show the chaos that fills the rest of the land. "Most of our people gathered together in the security of our home, but a few stayed behind and their minds and natures were affected by the changes around them. This was the first true split within the People. The glamredhel had come into being. The Chaos war had stripped them of their connection to the natural flow of magic within the land." 

Ithilcelu says, "As the war raged on between the titans, we the People remained safe within Elvandar, however the eldar upon finishing their work left our home. Their reasons can be guessed at, either from inbred loyalty to the Valheru or a desire to find a way to heal Midkemia we are not certain."

A fireplace crackles and hisses, consuming wood as the flames continue to burn.

Ithilcelu says, "Eventually, the raging magic caused by the clash dimmed and the lord of the Eagles came to us upon the back of his golden Dragon. He bid the people to be free, and to make our way in the world unchained by his brethren. His final words commanded us and set us apart from command all at once. This was the beginning of the second split within the People, those we now call our cousins feeling that with this freedom came ownership of Midkemia and we the gardeners feeling a desire to stay close to our new home."

Ithilcelu says, "In time, the glamredhel, filled with rage and madness, began to strike out, attacking those they found traveling and edging their warlike ways towards the forest. We cautioned healing, and outreach. Our to be cousins cautioned death to all who had been affected by the chaos, lest they destroy us as we reached out to them."

Ithilcelu&#39;s voice carries a pain known to nearly all eledhel as she continues sadly, "Our to be cousins set out against the wishes of the royal line, their purpose to eradicate those of our people who had been maddened and for many years, we believed them to have succeeded in their task. This was the rift that came between us. Banished from the forest 
for their genocide, they became the moredhel." 

Arianai sighs lightly, lips tight and she shifts uncomfortably, moving to a wooden stool with eyes on Ithilcelu.

Ithilcelu whispers, "Our Cousins sneared at what they perceived as weakness within us, vowing to gain the strength of the Valheru and gain power over all who now resided in the lands, and many strange new creatures there were to enslave, for as the war had raged rips formed within the fabric of time and space to other lands and the peoples of those lands came flooding through. This is how trolls, goblins, and even humans gained a life 
here."

Ithilcelu turns her eyes to Arianai and says softly, "This is how our people came to war among themselves, a war that carries on to this day, though we continue to reach out to our Cousins and attempt to bring their hearts peace so they may Return to us." 

Ithilcelu lifts her hand once more, dispelling the illusion that had carried pictures of her words.'>Elven Ale.
