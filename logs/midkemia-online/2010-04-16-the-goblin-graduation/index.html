Subj: Allies, Returned, Citizenship, and War

I wish to remind everyone of Sar-Sargoth&#39;s policies on these various topics:

Allies
======

With us or against us.

Returned

Citizenship
===========

Send a letter to the Witch-King. I might consider it. Gold sovereigns included 
in said letter may or may not grant extra consideration (it will).

War
===

Krondor: You stole our lands, pillaged them and then erected your pathetic, 
disgusting kingdom upon it. I intend to ensure not a stone remains of it - there
shall be no testament to your disgusting and vile &#39;society&#39;, you barbaric filth.


Also, I intend to steal your sewer-kitten for Praetor Ashurmannus, and make a 
set of gloves just for him from them.

Feel free to enter Sar-Sargoth and shop at our locales, so long as you are not

These are my territories. If you are an enemy to my people and we find you 
within them, we shall slit your throat, remove your head, scoop out whatever 
pathetic excuse for a brain exists within it, and give it to the cellar goblins 
for their personal enjoyments.

Subj: Weapons

Salutations, Sar-Sargoth.

  At the mercy of our patron Lady, I have been able to put a number of weapons 
up for sale in my shop at a very low price - a single silver coin.

  There are five sabers, three warhammers and two claymores available.

  I have used one of my designs, so if I find them showing up in other shops for
sale at a high price, I will be very, very wroth.

  These are intended for our young who have had their weapons decay, but they

PREAMBLE:
--------
Sar-Sargoth is the city of the Moredhel. It is inhabited pre-dominantly, and 
ruled by the Moredhel and the clans that they belong to. As a city forged and 
protected by the Clans, Sar-Sargoth extends rights and priviliges to the Greater
Clans within Sar-Sargoth. As a city of the Moredhel, Sar-Sargoth upholds the 
ever pursuit of the Dark Path and its relics, the greater pursuit for strength 
and power, the banishment of the invaders from the lands the Moredhel inherited 
from the Valehru, and the supremacy of the Moredhel race and its allies.

The goals of Sar-Sargoth are the following:

Ornate sconces have been carved directly into this chamber&#39;s thick obsidian 
walls, their backplates carefully sculpted into the shape of fierce dragons 
whose outstretched claws serve as bobeches for flickering candles. The candle&#39;s 
flames refract visibly within the topmost layers of the obsidian, giving the 
walls a slight blue tinge. An elaborate narrative relief featuring highly 
detailed carvings of Valheru, ancient dragons, and powerful warriors covers both
the east and west walls, while a faded antique triptych flanks the back wall. 
Tiered, circular pieces of hard-edged obsidian form a platform in the middle of

The Dragon Throne.
Ornate sconces have been carved directly into this chamber&#39;s thick obsidian 
walls, their backplates carefully sculpted into the shape of fierce dragons 
whose outstretched claws serve as bobeches for flickering candles. The candle&#39;s 
flames refract visibly within the topmost layers of the obsidian, giving the 
walls a slight blue tinge. An elaborate narrative relief featuring highly 
detailed carvings of Valheru, ancient dragons, and powerful warriors covers both
the east and west walls, while a faded antique triptych flanks the back wall. 
Tiered, circular pieces of hard-edged obsidian form a platform in the middle of 
the room, resting directly on wooden floors that have been immaculately 
maintained in this area despite their apparent age. The immense Dragon Throne 
towers here, dominating the room with it&#39;s malevolent presence. Raki Blackfyre 
is here. He wields a heavy draconic claymore in both hands. Jekjek is here. He

PRELUDE:

The Progression Sytem of the Clan of the Dragon is aimed in harnessing the 
different strengths of each of its Clan Members while ensuring a certain level 
of combat prowess and survivability within the Clan. As a clan ruled by rank and
its associated pecking order, each clansman of the Dragon is encouraged to 
progress further within the Clan. Each rank has its corresponding priviliges, 
with the highest rank being in the Dragon Council, the advisors of the Dragon 
Chieftain.

THE EDICTS OF SAR-SARGOTH

PREAMBLE:

Sar-Sargoth is the city of the Moredhel. It is inhabited pre-dominantly, and
ruled by the Moredhel and the clans that they belong to. As a city forged and
protected by the Clans, Sar-Sargoth extends rights and priviliges to the Greater
Clans within Sar-Sargoth. As a city of the Moredhel, Sar-Sargoth upholds the
ever pursuit of the Dark Path and its relics, the greater pursuit for strength
and power, the banishment of the invaders from the lands the Moredhel inherited
from the Valehru, and the supremacy of the Moredhel race and its allies.
The goals of Sar-Sargoth are the following:

The Dragon Throne.
Ornate sconces have been carved directly into this chamber's thick obsidian
walls, their backplates carefully sculpted into the shape of fierce dragons
whose outstretched claws serve as bobeches for flickering candles. The candle's
flames refract visibly within the topmost layers of the obsidian, giving the
walls a slight blue tinge. An elaborate narrative relief featuring highly
detailed carvings of Valheru, ancient dragons, and powerful warriors covers both
the east and west walls, while a faded antique triptych flanks the back wall.
Tiered, circular pieces of hard-edged obsidian form a platform in the middle of
the room, resting directly on wooden floors that have been immaculately
maintained in this area despite their apparent age. The immense Dragon Throne
towers here, dominating the room with it's malevolent presence. Raki Blackfyre

OATH OF THE DRAGON

I, __________ , swear fealty to the Dragon Clan and to the Dragon Chieftain. I
solemnly swear mine honour shall be one with the honour of my Clan, and my
blood, my breath and the strength of my arm shall fight tirelessly for the glory
of my Clan. Without cease, I shall hunt those who oppose the rule of the Dragon,
and without remorse they shall be slain. I shall drive before me all those who
oppose the Dark Path, and seize for my Clan the mantles of the Valheru. This I
give as my blood oath before the Dragon Throne. With loyalty, cunning and might,
I swear to serve, my will I submit, my life forfeit. Glory to the Dragon!

OATH OF THE DRAGON
------------------
I, __________ , swear fealty to the Dragon Clan and to the Dragon Chieftain. I
solemnly swear mine honour shall be one with the honour of my Clan, and my

oppose the Dark Path, and seize for my Clan the mantles of the Valheru. This I
give as my blood oath before the Dragon Throne. With loyalty, cunning and might,

The Dragon Throne.
Ornate sconces have been carved directly into this chamber's thick obsidian
walls, their backplates carefully sculpted into the shape of fierce dragons
whose outstretched claws serve as bobeches for flickering candles. The candle's
flames refract visibly within the topmost layers of the obsidian, giving the
walls a slight blue tinge. An elaborate narrative relief featuring highly
detailed carvings of Valheru, ancient dragons, and powerful warriors covers both
the east and west walls, while a faded antique triptych flanks the back wall.
Tiered, circular pieces of hard-edged obsidian form a platform in the middle of
the room, resting directly on wooden floors that have been immaculately
maintained in this area despite their apparent age. The immense Dragon Throne
towers here, dominating the room with it's malevolent presence. Raki Blackfyre
is here. He wields a heavy draconic claymore in both hands. Jekjek is here. He
wields a steel claymore in both hands.

PRELUDE:
The Progression Sytem of the Clan of the Dragon is aimed in harnessing the
different strengths of each of its Clan Members while ensuring a certain level
of combat prowess and survivability within the Clan. As a clan ruled by rank and
its associated pecking order, each clansman of the Dragon is encouraged to
progress further within the Clan. Each rank has its corresponding priviliges,
with the highest rank being in the Dragon Council, the advisors of the Dragon
Chieftain.
