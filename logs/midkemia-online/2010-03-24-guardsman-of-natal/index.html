More than five feet in length and at least two feet across, this intimidating weapon rivals a small 
human in height. The intricate crimson outline of a polar bear is carved against the smooth, black 
body of the  blade. Curving inward markedly before flaring back out at the top, serrated edges offer 
a menacing display of the claymore&#39;s intended use. The cross-guard is, by comparison, simple: little 
more than a curved black piece of steel holds the blade and hilt together firmly, with medium-sized 
metal hoops protruding from each end. A narrow pole of blackened steel with another piece affixed 
perpendicular to the pommel functions as the hilt, both wrapped tightly in a grip of white leather.

Keijima shows off an over-sized black claymore:
More than five feet in length and at least two feet across, this intimidating weapon rivals a small
human in height. The intricate crimson outline of a polar bear is carved against the smooth, black
body of the blade. Curving inward markedly before flaring back out at the top, serrated edges offer
a menacing display of the claymore's intended use. The cross-guard is, by comparison, simple: little
more than a curved black piece of steel holds the blade and hilt together firmly, with medium-sized
metal hoops protruding from each end. A narrow pole of blackened steel with another piece affixed
perpendicular to the pommel functions as the hilt, both wrapped tightly in a grip of white leather.
