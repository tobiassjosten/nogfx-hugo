The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds. Standing with a long pole in his hands, 
Rob is fishing in the brook here. A furious fisherman&#39;s wife stands here, hands planted firmly on 
her hips, and a rolling pin in one hand.
You see exits leading northwest and east.

You give the severed head of Abijah to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife.

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "There you go!"

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Happy?"

You say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife in the Kingdom Tongue, "Cat ate your tongue,

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife turns her nose up.

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Oh, really?"

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Thought you could get others to help you, and get away with

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "I&#39;ve no idea what you mean..."

You say in the Kingdom Tongue, "Why are you spreading the word?!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "I just maybe mentioned your little... involvement in my life to

Thinking hard, but finding yourself at a loss, you utter "Hmmm!"

A furious fisherman&#39;s wife says, "You should go find out."

You shout, "Vashnim! Where in the Halls are you hiding!"

You suspiciously eye a furious fisherman&#39;s wife, giving her the once over.

Vashnim the Busybody shouts, "Really now, indoor voices and proper behavior would do you a world of 
good."


You say to a furious fisherman&#39;s wife in the Kingdom Tongue, "Fine... I thought I could amend things.

There are 30 boundary wardens here. Moving silently about behind the bar, Baklav the barman is here. 
There is a simple doorway here, tiny silver fragments glinting and catching your eye. There are 3 
wooden stools here. There is a fireplace here. Hanging here are festive green and gold streamers. 
With ears perked upright, a blue dun gelding stands here. A proud Keshian bloodstock stallion stands 
here, head held high. Lips pursed as she surveys the area, Vashnim the Busybody listens to all as

a sign instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading west (open door) and southeast.
Piercing you with her curious gaze, Vashnim the Busybody turns back to the constant clatter of her

You unwield a silver Hammer of War.

You give a bottle of Keshian chardonnay to Vashnim the Busybody.

You sit down on a wooden stool.

You say to Vashnim the Busybody, "So... Seems we have to talk, Vashnim."

You wield a paper bag filled with honeyed sweetmeats in your left hand.

You examine Vashnim the Busybody in the room:
Elegant despite her pinched expression and fading beauty, Vashnim the Busybody appears decidedly 
spry and quick-witted for her advanced years. Elderly even by the standards of the timeless eledhel, 
she has managed to keep her graceful appearance despite the touch of silver in her blonde hair. 
Swathed in layers of crochet and lacework, Vashnim&#39;s slender fingers seem to constantly click and 
move her needles, even as she moves her mouth in a ceaseless flow whenever the moment to share 
strikes her.
Vashnim the Busybody is quite powerful.

With a faint jingle of bells, Haberdash the Minstrel enters from the southeast.

You suspiciously eye Haberdash the Minstrel, giving him the once over.

You say to Haberdash the Minstrel, "No making songs out of this!"
Haberdash the Minstrel says, "Ah, it&#39;s a song you want Abijah? Hrm, let me think then.
"

Haberdash the Minstrel tilts his head to the side, deep in thought.

Haberdash the Minstrel says, "Do you prefer a story of love, a ballad of great adventures or a song 
of the Eledhel&#39;s calling?"

You say, "Shush!"

Vashnim the Busybody says, "Ooh hellooo."

With a merry smile, Haberdash leaves to the southeast.

You have emoted: Abijah quickly nods at Vashnim the Busybody as Haberdash departs.

With a faint jingle of bells, Haberdash the Minstrel enters from the southeast.

You suspiciously eye Haberdash the Minstrel, giving him the once over.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "What do you want?"

With a merry smile, Haberdash leaves to the west.

You say to Vashnim the Busybody, "Please, heed yourself with some wine."
Baklav the barman says, "Ah yes, I sell ale as well as wine, though I am in need of more wood for 
tankards."

You quickly devour a paper bag filled with honeyed sweetmeats.

You say to Vashnim the Busybody, "I heard you know about me, Vashnim."

Vashnim the Busybody says in Eledhel, "Hmm? Did someone say something?"

Vashnim the Busybody runs her hand through her hair in an easy gesture, and fixes Abijah with a 
curious expression.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "I may..."

You say, "Yes... People have been talking about me..."

You suspiciously eye Vashnim the Busybody, giving her the once over.

Vashnim the Busybody &#39;s lips curl into a faint smile.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "People have the tendency to talk, don&#39;t they?"

You say to Vashnim the Busybody, "And you certainly can say that!"

You say to Vashnim the Busybody, "So, are you friends with Rob&#39;s Wife... I heard?"

Vashnim the Busybody says, "Where did you hear that, I wonder?"

You give Vashnim the Busybody a wry smile, clearly quite amused.

You say, "She told me...!"

You nod your head sagely.

Vashnim the Busybody smiles softly and inclines her head.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "I have many friends, of course."

Vashnim the Busybody laughs mirthfully.

Vashnim the Busybody smiles and says, "One does not live to my age without friends to take you along 
the way."

You have emoted: Abijah looks pensive, nodding rapidly at Vashnim&#39;s statement "So... I wonder... 
What drives her?" 

Vashnim the Busybody shrugs softly, her shoulders moving fractionally.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "Who is to say? She is a loving wife, from what I know."

"Pssh!" you mutter derisively.

Vashnim the Busybody&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement at you.

You have emoted: Abijah mutters comically "Loving wife... Right...!" 

Vashnim the Busybody looks at Abijah in open amusement.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "Do you know otherwise, I wonder??"

You say to Vashnim the Busybody, "Of course! She beats Rob, poor Rob... I want to make his life 
better."

Vashnim the Busybody leans forward, open interest spread across her face.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "You don&#39;t say?"

You say, "She never leaves his side... But not because she&#39;s caring, nooo! She&#39;s pesters him! She 
suffocates him... The poor man can&#39;t even take a pis..- Eh, breathe without her 
approval!"

Vashnim the Busybody nods, her posture betraying her keen interest.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "That is fascinating. For a modest fee, I might be able to ensure poor 
Rob&#39;s situation is well known."

Vashnim the Busybody says, "Perhaps he will receive some relief if all know of his wife&#39;s action, 
yes?"

Vashnim the Busybody says, "Simply pass me a silver, if you wish."

You have emoted: Abijah cautiously gazes about, to check if anyone strange is checking her moves 
before opening her pack, tilting her head to Vashnim as if to remember something "Ah, yes... And 
please, don&#39;t make Haberdash do a song out of this, I have a... Reputation to maintain." 

Vashnim the Busybody folds her hand together and nods, a pleasant gleam to her eye.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "I will only say what you wish to be said."

You nod your head slowly.

You give 1 silver to Vashnim the Busybody.
Vashnim the Busybody says in Eledhel, "Alright sweet girl, that coin is a sweet jewel in my hand. 
Now, tell me what it is you wished me to pass along..."
Vashnim the Busybody slips the coin quickly beneath the pile of yarn in her lap.

Vashnim the Busybody says in Eledhel, "So, what is this about? The subject, I mean."
[Hint]: You need to TELL VASHNIM THE SUBJECT IS <your subject>. One word only!

You tell Vashnim the Busybody, "THE SUBJECT IS payback."
Vashnim the Busybody tells you, "Ooh how exciting, it is not often I hear of something new. Do go on,
 I&#39;m all aquiver with anticipation."
[Hint]: You need to TELL VASHNIM <your exact gossip>
Remember to use your common sense when adding rumors, we do police them heavily.

You grin mischievously at Vashnim the Busybody.

Vashnim the Busybody nods.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "Alright, and what is the juicy tale?"

You tell Vashnim the Busybody, "Rob&#39;s wife is a selfless clingy woman, who never leaves his side, 
not even to let him tend to his physical necessities. She beats him every night, and every morning 
she spanks him, and the poor man has not a moment of peace."

Vashnim the Busybody nods her head slowly.

Vashnim the Busybody tells you, "Oh yes, yes, I&#39;ll consider that, very good, very good. Now I need 
some time to think on what you said, please forgive me if I ruminate upon things..."

Vashnim the Busybody rubs her hands together and nods slyly at Abijan.

Vashnim the Busybody says, "Alright, my dear. I&#39;ll take it from here!"

You wink at Vashnim the Busybody.

say to Vashnim Thank you for your openness, maybe we can business again in the future
You say to Vashnim the Busybody, "Thank you for your openness, maybe we can business again in the 
future."

You stand up.

(Matawa): You say, "Pls God-ie! Make Haberdash do a song out of this :D."

Vashnim the Busybody says in Eledhel, "Isn&#39;t THAT interesting..."

Vashnim the Busybody lifts a graying brow, eyeing a passing patron before she smirks and turns back 
to her knitting.

You bow respectfully to Vashnim the Busybody.'>Shore near fishing grounds.
The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds. Standing with a long pole in his hands,
Rob is fishing in the brook here. A furious fisherman's wife stands here, hands planted firmly on
her hips, and a rolling pin in one hand.
You see exits leading northwest and east.
You give the severed head of Abijah to a furious fisherman's wife.

before opening her pack, tilting her head to Vashnim as if to remember something "Ah, yes... And
please, don't make Haberdash do a song out of this, I have a... Reputation to maintain."
Vashnim the Busybody folds her hand together and nods, a pleasant gleam to her eye.
Vashnim the Busybody says, "I will only say what you wish to be said."
You nod your head slowly.
You give 1 silver to Vashnim the Busybody.
Vashnim the Busybody says in Eledhel, "Alright sweet girl, that coin is a sweet jewel in my hand.
Now, tell me what it is you wished me to pass along..."
Vashnim the Busybody slips the coin quickly beneath the pile of yarn in her lap.
Vashnim the Busybody says in Eledhel, "So, what is this about? The subject, I mean."
[Hint]: You need to TELL VASHNIM THE SUBJECT IS &lt;your subject>. One word only!
You tell Vashnim the Busybody, "THE SUBJECT IS payback."
Vashnim the Busybody tells you, "Ooh how exciting, it is not often I hear of something new. Do go on,
I'm all aquiver with anticipation."
[Hint]: You need to TELL VASHNIM &lt;your exact gossip>
Remember to use your common sense when adding rumors, we do police them heavily.
You grin mischievously at Vashnim the Busybody.
Vashnim the Busybody nods.
Vashnim the Busybody says, "Alright, and what is the juicy tale?"
You tell Vashnim the Busybody, "Rob's wife is a selfless clingy woman, who never leaves his side,
not even to let him tend to his physical necessities. She beats him every night, and every morning
she spanks him, and the poor man has not a moment of peace."
Vashnim the Busybody nods her head slowly.
Vashnim the Busybody tells you, "Oh yes, yes, I'll consider that, very good, very good. Now I need
some time to think on what you said, please forgive me if I ruminate upon things..."
Vashnim the Busybody rubs her hands together and nods slyly at Abijan.
Vashnim the Busybody says, "Alright, my dear. I'll take it from here!"
You wink at Vashnim the Busybody.
say to Vashnim Thank you for your openness, maybe we can business again in the future
You say to Vashnim the Busybody, "Thank you for your openness, maybe we can business again in the
future."
You stand up.
(Matawa): You say, "Pls God-ie! Make Haberdash do a song out of this :D."
Vashnim the Busybody says in Eledhel, "Isn't THAT interesting..."
Vashnim the Busybody lifts a graying brow, eyeing a passing patron before she smirks and turns back
to her knitting.
You bow respectfully to Vashnim the Busybody.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+2 points with 2 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
