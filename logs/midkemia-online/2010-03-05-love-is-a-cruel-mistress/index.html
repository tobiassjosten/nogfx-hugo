You tell Saithe Faal, Wolf&#39;s Ward, "Oh, you prefer menfolk?"

You tell Saithe Faal, Wolf&#39;s Ward, "Hm."

Saithe tells you in Moredhel, "Not at all, but compared to Aulle."

You tell Saithe Faal, Wolf&#39;s Ward, "Perhaps the Witch King might have use for you."

Keijima gives Xaros a respectful salute.

You are now speaking the Kingdom Tongue.

Lilah suspiciously eyes you.

You tell Saithe Faal, Wolf&#39;s Ward, "Service to your Witch King comes before all else, my Ward."

The corners of Keijima&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

Demonbane Xaros Zandrosin says in Moredhel to Keijima, "I challenge you to a duel, for the right to let Lilah marry as she wishes."

You ponder the situation, trying to take everything into account.

Lilah raises her eyes skyward, hoping for a sign.

Keijima Caoimhe, The Great Destroyer exclaims in Moredhel, "However, for even suggesting such, you will bleed!"

You say to Lilah, "There is hope yet."

Keijima scowls.

You are now speaking Moredhel.

You say to Keijima in Moredhel, "Your posing and manly swinging of your sword only intensify her urges to consummate the marriage."

Lilah blinks.

You say in Moredhel, "Quick version, or the long version?"

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "Both."

You nod your head emphatically.

You say in Moredhel, "Quick version, Keijima asked Lilah to marry him. She agreed with much reluctance."

Radakail rolls his eyes.

You say in Moredhel, "Xaros, having had something of a relationship with Lilah for some time, asked for a duel to decide who Lilah would marry."

You say in Moredhel, "Xaros won."

You say in Moredhel, "Keijima left, in shame."

You say in Moredhel, "And that is the short version."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "And the long?"

You say in Moredhel, "He mistreated her, as he is wont to do."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "And?"

You say in Moredhel, "And apparently this mistreatment was a cover for his.."

You smile wryly, clearly quite amused.

You say in Moredhel, "True feelings."

You say in Moredhel, "I believe the letter he wrote read something along the lines of "Ever since I first saw you fighting at the gates of Krondor, I have always loved you"."

You say in Moredhel, "Usual tripe."

You say in Moredhel, "I translated the entire ordeal."

Radakail raises an eyebrow.

You say in Moredhel, "Lilah agreed through fear of what would happen if she refused."

You say in Moredhel, "Xaros was made aware of the situation, and after some contemplation, he challenged Keijima to a duel."

You say in Moredhel, "Keijima bid some number of us to follow him and bear witness."

You say in Moredhel, "They fought."

Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel, "Er, Keijima challenge Xaros, I believe."

You say in Moredhel, "Keijima claims he lost because he could not take his eyes from Lilah, and thus lost."

You shake your head.

You say in Moredhel, "Xaros challenged."

Comprehension flashes across Volyen&#39;s face.

You let out a deep sigh.

You say in Moredhel, "Very well."

You say to Radakail in Moredhel, "We believe Keijima threw the fight, sir."

You say to Radakail in Moredhel, "And I do not think the Iron Talon and his Aide would be wrong in such."

Radakail rolls his eyes.

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "I&#39;ve known Keijima for some time. He would not throw a fight."

You smile wryly, clearly quite amused.

You say in Moredhel, "I knew him to do so."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "I also know Keijima would not lose, especially to a human."

You say in Moredhel, "He threw several with me, actually."

You say in Moredhel, "Admitted to such."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "Which means this human has cheated, and dishonoured my... Former... Warlord."

You shake your head.

Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel, "Witch-King, he was hardly fighting."

You say in Moredhel, "No, sire."

You say in Moredhel, "He threw the fight."

Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel, "He barely seemed to move."

You say in Moredhel, "Aye."

Radakail creases his brow and frowns.

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "Why would he throw the fight?"

You say in Moredhel, "I have fought with and against Keijima many times."

You say in Moredhel, "He was not fighting at his full capabilities."

You ponder the situation, trying to take everything into account.

You say to Volyen in Moredhel, "Whhat could drive the Warlord to throw the fight?"

You crease your brow and frown.

Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel to you, "I can only assume one thing."

You say to Volyen in Moredhel, "Do tell."

Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel to Radakail, "It is possible that it was the previous Warlord&#39;s intent to throw the fight so he had an excuse to leave the city, albeit a very poor one."

You let out a deep sigh.

You say in Moredhel, "That was my guess too."

You say in Moredhel, "I thought my saying it would be unwise, however."

Radakail smirks with satisfaction.

You say to Volyen in Moredhel, "He did leave in much haste and with little thought."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "A troll and a human."

You grunt noncommittally.

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "Accusing a moredhel of abandonment - if not treason?"

Radakail smirks with satisfaction.

You say in Moredhel, "I renounced my humanity some time ago."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "Renounce away."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "It changes little."

You say in Moredhel, "It changes much, sire."

Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel to Radakail, "I do not accuse him of it."

Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel to Radakail, "I just cannot think of another reason."

You ask Radakail in Moredhel, "Can you think of a reason why he might think to throw a fight, sire?"

You tilt your head towards Radakail, listening intently.

Radakail grunts noncommittally.

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "I am hungry."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "Quit spreading lies."'>Sar-Sargoth Central Square.

You say to Volyen in Moredhel, "Do tell."
Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel to Radakail, "It is possible that it was the previous Warlord's intent to throw the fight so he had an excuse to leave the city, albeit a very poor one."
You let out a deep sigh.
You say in Moredhel, "That was my guess too."
You say in Moredhel, "I thought my saying it would be unwise, however."
Radakail smirks with satisfaction.
You say to Volyen in Moredhel, "He did leave in much haste and with little thought."

Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "Renounce away."
Master Radakail, Witch-King of the North says in Moredhel, "It changes little."
You say in Moredhel, "It changes much, sire."
Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel to Radakail, "I do not accuse him of it."
Troll King, Volyen, the Iron Talon says in Moredhel to Radakail, "I just cannot think of another reason."
You ask Radakail in Moredhel, "Can you think of a reason why he might think to throw a fight, sire?"
You tilt your head towards Radakail, listening intently.
