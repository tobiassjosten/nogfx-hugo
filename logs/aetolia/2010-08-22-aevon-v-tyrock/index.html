look tyrock
He is a muscular Human vampire and stands at six feet tall. The brown skin visible on his arms and legs has strange runic markings that have been burned into his flesh. His black hair stops at his neck in the back, and is kept trimmed in the front allowing a few strands to fall down the outskirts of his face. His crimson eyes look out on the world with determination. He is wearing:
a suit of scale mail
a dark hooded cloak of House Voltaire
roughshod black leather boots
a pair of men's casual black slacks
a crimson shirt
a silver crown
a necklace of purity
2 gold stud earrings
a lunar eclipse medallion
a spun flame ring
a silver ring
an interwoven shadow ring
a bound lightning ring

--- Arena Path outside the Caves - -1:0:0 ---
The path darkens here as it approaches a wide cavern entrance within a sheer rock face. The great expanse of the caverns is an ominous presence, though the path into it is heavily worn. The outer wall of the arena connects to the side of the great stone surrounding the caves in a seamless groove. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully. Earl Tyrock Voltaire is here. He wields a steel Theran broadsword in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading east and southwest.

look me
He is a dexterous Yeleni and is a translucent being radiating a soft silvery light. The rays emanating from his form seem almost tangibly solid though ephemeral. His height oscillates from six to ten feet as the light emanating from him waxes and wanes. The Seal of Oloren - a rising argent sun glows brilliantly from the center of his chest, the brightness of which waxes and wanes as well. His eyes lack an iris or pupil, instead tiny motes of brilliant white light coalesce and disperse as his gaze shifts. Ethereal ribbon-like wings composed entirely of light extend from his back, drifting as though buffeted by unseen winds. He is wearing:
an amber ring etched with flames
a shadowdrop earring
an inscribed mithril ring
an amber ring etched with icicles
a crisp, white shirt of the Paladins
a classy pair of white pants
an amber ring etched with lightning bolts

look tyrock
He is a muscular Human vampire and stands at six feet tall. The brown skin visible on his arms and legs has strange runic markings that have been burned into his flesh. His black hair stops at his neck in the back, and is kept trimmed in the front allowing a few strands to fall down the outskirts of his face. His crimson eyes look out on the world with determination. He is wearing:
a suit of scale mail
a dark hooded cloak of House Voltaire
roughshod black leather boots
a pair of men's casual black slacks
a crimson shirt
a silver crown
a necklace of purity
2 gold stud earrings
a lunar eclipse medallion
a spun flame ring
a silver ring
an interwoven shadow ring
a bound lightning ring

The path darkens here as it approaches a wide cavern entrance within a sheer rock face. The great expanse of the caverns is an ominous presence, though the path into it is heavily worn. The outer wall of the arena connects to the side of the great stone surrounding the caves in a seamless groove. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully. Earl Tyrock Voltaire is here. He wields a steel Theran broadsword in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.

A series of spectator benches dominates this section of the Fields of Valor. Many rows of benches rise at a steep angle, affording a commanding view of this historical arena and all the varied environments it contains. A long row of pedestals runs in front of the benches, each holding an odd, glowing, green globe. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully. Earl Tyrock Voltaire is here. He wields a steel Theran broadsword in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading northeast and east.

look me
He is a dexterous Yeleni and is a translucent being radiating a soft silvery light. The rays emanating from his form seem almost tangibly solid though ephemeral. His height oscillates from six to ten feet as the light emanating from him waxes and wanes. The Seal of Oloren - a rising argent sun glows brilliantly from the center of his chest, the brightness of which waxes and wanes as well. His eyes lack an iris or pupil, instead tiny motes of brilliant white light coalesce and disperse as his gaze shifts. Ethereal ribbon-like wings composed entirely of light extend from his back, drifting as though buffeted by unseen winds. He is wearing:
an amber ring etched with flames
a shadowdrop earring
an inscribed mithril ring
an amber ring etched with icicles
a crisp, white shirt of the Paladins
a classy pair of white pants
an amber ring etched with lightning bolts
a tower shield
an elegant black silk top hat
a black skull armband
a pair of sturdy leather boots
a powerful yew darkbow
a leather falconry glove
a blue, leather Paladin's weaponbelt
a canvas backpack
a shimmering suit of full plate armour
a Royal Enorian Army soldier's quiver
He walks with the blessing of Dhar.
