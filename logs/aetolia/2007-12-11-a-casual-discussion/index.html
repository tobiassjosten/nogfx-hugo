You have emoted: Evangeline taps her fingers against the book she is reading, 
then places it back into the bookshelf.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "You are still filled with your directionless anger, 
then."

West wing of the library.
This section of the library houses all works of fiction.  Vast mahogany 
bookshelves line the walls, filled with stories and poems.  Great tragedies, 
comedies, and romances from all countries are represented in this collection.  
The floor in the middle of the room is sunken, with chairs, tables, and lamps 
arranged for casual reading.  Whimsical tapestries decorate the walls between 
bookshelves. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the 
ground. An aura of despair emanates from the Indorani guard that stands watch 
here. A carrion beetle lies dead here. Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra is here, shrouded. He 
wields a needled-pointed dirk in his right hand. Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra is here.A 
small sign indicates that LIBRARY CATALOG will list the materials in this 
library.
You see exits leading east and southeast.

You glare angrily at Ashmer.

You say, "What do you think?!"

Ashmer chews thoughtfully on his lip.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "This near, it is apparent."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "It rolls off of you in waves. Quite interesting, I 
must say."

Ashmer licks his lips.

A great weight seems to have been lifted from Ashmer.

Ashmer takes some salve from a vial and rubs it on his skin.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Let us see..."

You stare implacably at Ashmer.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Anger without a focus, an element, is weakness."

Ashmer&#39;s aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
You think of Ashmer and find that your feelings for him have changed.

Ashmer takes a long drag off his pipe.

You feel an unusually strong lust for Crassus Koneko, Templar of Shadow.
Iltarien Lunare is an ally.
Tenedos Voltaire is an ally.

Jeloseth Nakliet-Mirari is an ally.
Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra is an ally.
Vahlius Bouchard is an ally.

You suddenly perceive the vague outline of an aura of rebounding around Ashmer.

Ashmer takes a long drag off his pipe.

You say, "Weakness?"

You say, "You talk to me of weakness?"

You snort arrogantly.

You say, "What do you know of it?"

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "It is a weapon, for both the bearer and the others. 
Only one may wield it, however."

You say, "Oh?"

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Those who cannot, perish under the yoke of the 
wielder."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "What do you know of weakness, unforgiven?"

A great weight seems to have been lifted from Ashmer.

You have emoted: Evangeline appraises you for a moment, then says curtly, "I&#39;ll
rather not share them with you."

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra closes his mundane eye and slips his hands from his sleeves, 
the dirk in his hand apparent as he slides it from its shelter.

Ashmer discerns someone&#39;s true loyalties.

Ashmer licks his lips.

Ashmer discerns someone&#39;s true loyalties.

Ashmer&#39;s aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
You think of Ashmer and find that your feelings for him have changed.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Not your weaknesses, unforgiven. Of weakness."

You have emoted: Evangeline eyes the dirk in your hand warily, not saying a 
word.

Ashmer discerns someone&#39;s true loyalties.

You say, "Weakness.."

You say, "Can be purged. But anger and cruelty eliminates this weakness we all 
seem to have."

The deepening dusk yields to impenetrable darkness as night claims the land.

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Oh? Is that so."

You have emoted: Evangeline raises her head and stares directly into your eyes.
"Yes," she says.

Ashmer licks his lips.

You think of Ashmer and find that your feelings for him have changed.

You tilt your head and listen intently to Ashmer.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra meets your stare nonchalantly, and your anger flares, hate of
Ashmer filling you to the point of boiling over.

Ashmer pulls at your emotional well-being.

Foaming at the mouth, you gnaw at Ashmer&#39;s arm.

You pound maniacally at Ashmer&#39;s chest.

Screaming and spitting, you lash out with your fingers, trying to scratch 
Ashmer&#39;s eyes out.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "That it is so simple to twist?"

You say, "What is this!?"

Screaming and spitting, you lash out with your fingers, trying to scratch 
Ashmer&#39;s eyes out.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Your anger, unforgiven."

Foaming at the mouth, you gnaw at Ashmer&#39;s arm.

A nearly invisible magical shield forms around Ashmer.

A dizzying beam of energy strikes you as your attack rebounds off of Ashmer&#39;s 
shield.

Ashmer takes a drink from a withering presence vial.

You slap Ashmer with a resounding smack.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra returns his head to an original position, an eerie look in 
his eye.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Amusing."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "And your thoughts on weakness now."

You think of Ashmer and find that your feelings for him have changed.

You glare angrily at Ashmer.

The stars wink into existence, familiar constellations illuminating the night 
with tales of myth and legend.

You spit on the ground near Ashmer in disgust.


Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra meets your eyes in an icy stare. An icy hiss fills your mind,
resounding in the void between your ears, "Have you learnt nothing, unforgiven?
This directionless anger is a weakness, a crutch and useless limb."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "It is so simple to control, to twist. It will be your 
doom, should you let it purge you of your sense."

You blink.

You snarl, "Anger is easy to twist?"

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Must I demonstrate further?"

Tenedos arrives from the east.

You stare implacably at Ashmer.

Count Tenedos Voltaire says, "Greetings, Lady Evangeline."

Tenedos narrows his eyes and then blinks rapidly, several times.

Ashmer licks his lips.

You perform a graceful curtsey towards Tenedos.

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

You say, "Greetings, Lord Tenedos."

You have emoted: Evangeline &#39;s eyes never leaves Ashmer as she speaks.

his right. A small sign indicates that LIBRARY CATALOG will list the materials

You see exits leading east and southeast.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra dips into a slight bow, inconspicuously slipping the dirk in 
his hand into the deep sleeve of his robe opposing it.

You say to Ashmer, "So what now? Feel free to demonstrate. I don&#39;t believe my 
anger is a weakness."

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

Count Tenedos Voltaire says, "Is there a problem?"

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says to Tenedos, "A discussion."

Deepest Stygian night steals over the land as the symbolic hourglass empties 
and turns, ready to begin a new day.
It is now the 23rd of Variach, year 200 of the Midnight Age.

Ashmer tells you, "Come, let us take this elsewhere. We would not want to 
interrupt Lord Tenedos&#39; studies."

You tell Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra, "Fine."

You perform a graceful curtsey towards Tenedos.

You say, "We&#39;ll take this elsewhere."

Foyer of Voltaire Library.
Light reflects off the glistening marble floor of this immense foyer which 
seems to be illuminated by the keystones of giant arches high above, which glow
brightly with some arcane magic. Stretching across the ceiling a virtuoso 
artist has painted a large, detailed map of Sapience.  Along the wall tables 
and plush sitting chairs have been arranged to facilitate quiet study. At the 
far end of the room lies a grand fireplace, roaring with fire provided by gas 
from a fissure underneath the fireplace.  Nearby a staircase leads to the 
tower, where the Voltaire Consanguine manage the House and engage in private 
research. A black marble pedestal has been knocked over, cracking the bowl that
once rested upon it. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is 
on the ground. There are 3 imposing Indorani guards here. Zeze wo Ozidmu du, 
Countess Kiralla Koneko-Voltaire, Blood Regent is here. She wields a thin 
ceremonial athame in her left hand. Crassus Koneko, Templar of Shadow is here, 
shrouded. He wields a tower shield in his left hand.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast(open), west, northwest, up, 
down(open) and out(open).

On a staircase.
This stairway is dark and steep and creaks with age. Portraits of lesser 
noblemen are placed sporadically on the walls, which close in narrowly around 
you, creating a feeling of claustrophobia. A sigil in the shape of a small, 
rectangular monolith is on the ground. There are 3 imposing Indorani guards 
here.
You see exits leading north, up and down.

Hallway high in the tower.
This luxurious room sits at the top of the staircase. Plush red carpeting, 
ivory end tables, and gold-framed portraits lend an air of extreme wealth to 
this place.  There are many doors leading to private chambers from this room, 
including a spiral staircase leading to a door in the ceiling.
You see exits leading northeast(closed), east(open), south(open), 
southwest(closed), up(closed) and down.

The study of Vorlus.
This expansive study is lit by a sparkling chandelier in the center of the 
ceiling, which radiates a warm soft light throughout the room. The light is 
soft enough to keep the room in a state of almost perpetual twilight. The floor
consists of well polished redwood floorboards, covered in some places by large 
fluffy rugs. The walls of the room appear to have been carved out of the rock 
and left that way, giving the room the appearance of a cave. A large oak table 
sits in the center of the room, it&#39;s surface polished to perfection. It is 
surrounded by six matching chairs of the same wood, also polished and adorned 
with simple crimson cushions. Off to the rear end of the room sit a cluttered 
desk and large black chair. Books and papers are stacked in messy piles off to 
one side, the owner obviously in the middle of studies of some sort. In the 
centre of the desk lies a shimmering green crystal, one large facet of which 
has been worked to perfection. Colorful images swirl in the depths, drawing the
eyes almost hypnotically. Beside the desk sits a large plush crimson lounge 
chair and a candelabra, obviously a well used reading area. An aura of despair 
emanates from the Indorani guard that stands watch here.
You see a single exit leading north(open).

Ashmer arrives from the north.

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

You close the door to the north.

Ashmer throws back his head and utters a string of words that sends a shiver 
down your spine.
Ashmer arrives from the ether.

Ashmer opens the door to the north.

Ashmer leaves to the north.

Ashmer arrives from the north.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Your anger."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "What do you believe you hate us for, hm? There is 
always a reason, an excuse, behind such things."

You shrug helplessly.

You say, "Well..I don&#39;t know."

You smile wryly.


Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Directionless."

Ashmer pales slightly.

Ashmer gasps, and glows momentarily.

Ashmer gives you the once over.

You have emoted: Evangeline walks to the other end of the room, then turns 
around to look at you.

Ashmer begins to wield a needled-pointed dirk in his right hand.

Ashmer discerns someone&#39;s true loyalties.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Have you ever wondered, perhaps, what would happen if 
your anger were to be turned against you?"

Ashmer opens the door to the north.

You ponder the situation.

You say, "No."

Ras&#39;valyra is here.
You see a single exit leading north(open).

Ashmer closes the door to the north.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Allow me to enlighten you."

Ashmer pulls at your emotional well-being.

You use your right foot to stomp on your left as hard as possible.

You bleed 10 health.

Ashmer gives you the once over.

You drive a clenched fist into your gut.

You no longer enjoy pain.
You feel Ashmer&#39;s touch heal you of illness.

Ashmer eats a lobelia seed.

Flames erupt over all over your body and begin to consume your flesh.

You take a drink from a plain wooden vial.
The elixir heals and soothes you.

You take out some salve and quickly rub it on your skin.
The raging fire about your skin goes out.

Ashmer creases his brow in a frown.

You may apply another salve to yourself.

You may drink another health or mana elixir.

Ashmer opens the door to the north.

Ashmer leaves to the north.
He is followed by Ashmer.

Ashmer arrives from the north.
He is followed by Ashmer.

Ashmer closes the door to the north.

You wince in pain.

You say, "So this is how it feels like, hmm?"

Ashmer peers at you and you feel as though you are knee-deep in thick, sticky 
mud.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "So you see."

Ashmer licks his lips.

You have emoted: Evangeline coughs slightly, then glares at you. "I do not 
willingly give up my feelings."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "No. You will cling to your anger."

You say, "And how are you going to make me give them up then, if that&#39;s your 
intention?"

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Your hate of me for killing Jeloseth, for splitting 
open his chest and slaying him in the most painful way your immortal mind could
imagine. For his begging and his screams, for his torment at the hands of the 
Lord Jy&#39;Barrak Golgotha&#39;s minions in His pits."

You smirk.

You say, "You got that right."

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

You point a thin ceremonial athame at Ashmer.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "No cries of protestation? No threats of my painful 
demise? His end was only the beginning of his torment. You saw his heart, 
ripped from his chest while it still contained his beating essence."

The loud and powerful toll of a bell fills the air with tension, as city 
watchmen signal the coming of dawn.

Ashmer slowly fades into view, returning to the realm of perception.

Ashmer takes a drink from a withering presence vial.

You give a pained sigh.

You say, "I couldn&#39;t do anything to you even if I wanted."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "And why is that."

You shrug helplessly.

You say, "You&#39;ll probably do the same to me."

You say, "As what you did to Jeloseth."

You say, "No?"

You smirk.

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Do you wish to hurt me? To kill me, for what I did?"

You say, "Tempting indeed.."

Your eyes twinkle enchantingly.

You say, "But no."

You smile wryly.

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "So you have learnt."

You narrow your eyes at Ashmer.

Ashmer discerns someone&#39;s true loyalties.

You say, "Learnt? No..I merely wish not to dirty my hands."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "You feel fear."

You have emoted: Evangeline blinks at you, then freezes all her movements, as 
if you had guessed it correctly the emotion that is going through her.

Ashmer smirks.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra strides forward, the multitude of scars that cover nearly 
every inch of his exposed skin becoming apparent as he nears.

Ashmer discerns someone&#39;s true loyalties.

You have emoted: Evangeline frowns slightly, then gasps in horror at the 
numerous scars on your skin. "W-what&#39;s that?"

Ashmer:
He is a frog-like Grook and is a disturbing sight to behold.  Smooth skin of a 
sickly malachite hue clings to his thin frame, which seems to absorb and trap 
the surrounding light in its tenebrous contours.  A webbed crest, like a blade 
of skin, cuts down across the back of his head, having taken on a murky grey 
tint, nearly white on the broad flaps of skin between the thin spines.  The 
same murky, smoky grey swirls across the skin of his wrists and palms, slipping
through the gap between his long, thin fingers.  Thin, white scars lash across 
nearly every inch of his visible skin, contrasting violently with the malachite
hue.  His right eye is a dull yellow, which glints eerily in the available 
light, revealing jagged, crimson flecks interspersed throughout the golden orb.
His other eye, however, is a frightening sight.  The skin and flesh that 
surrounded it have been completely stripped away, leaving a pale, bloodshot 
orb, devoid of any discernible iris and pupil, anchored to the exposed bone of 
his ghastly eye socket with slight sinews.  The glistening muscle entwines and 
turns as the orb shifts its gaze eerily, independent of his other eye.  There 
is no audible hint of his presence, and his chest barely rises and falls with 
each faint breath that passes his lips.  His movements are smooth and measured,
giving him a disturbingly ghost-like appearance as he shifts his weight, his 
subtle motion hardly noticeable to the casual eye.  He stands at an odd angle, 
not quite perpendicular to the ground, and seems to sway hypnotically to some 
unheard rhythm, his thin, malachite lips parting slightly to reveal a set of 
ebon fangs, which glisten eerily in the available light.  A sinister emerald 
glow issues from a grim, chaotic marking, seared into the flesh above his right
eye.  A faint wisp of smoke rises from the scar, dissipating into the air with 
an otherworldly hiss. He is wearing:
a leather bag
inky black robes of the Cabal
a suit of scale mail
He walks in the favor of Ere.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra whips his dirk through the air in front of your face, missing
it by a fraction of an inch. "None of your concern," his hisses.

You have emoted: Evangeline jerks her head away, then starts backing away from 
you a step at a time.

Rising higher in the sky, the sun illuminates the land, confining darkness to 
the shadows.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra rests the very tip of his thin blade at the hollow of your 
throat, dragging it lightly over the flesh of your neck and tracing your own 
scar without drawing blood.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "And what is this?"

You have emoted: Evangeline twists her head to the side, disturbed by the 
feelings of your dirk on her neck. "Nothing you should know, " she says 
harshly.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra steps closer once more, the tip of his dirk tugging slightly 
at your skin. "I do believe I should."

You have emoted: Evangeline purses her lips, unwilling to say another word. She
winces slightly as she feels the sharp edge of the dirk on her neck, seemingly 
eager to dig into it.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra.
He is 20 years old, having been born on the 16th of Slyphian, year 179 of the 
Midnight Age.
He is ranked 779th in Aetolia.
He is an acceptable character.
He is a Nomad in the Fellowship of Explorers.
He is a member of the clan called &#39;Necromante Unicate.&#39;
He is considered to be approximately 840% of your might.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra drags the blade up and under your jaw, nonchalantly poising 
the dirk so as to raise your chin to meet his gaze. "I am eager to hear the 
tale."

You have emoted: Evangeline meets your gaze steadily, her eyes glinting with 
what seems like defiance. "No," she utters.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra grips his dirk, his gaze never leaving yours. He smirks, as 
if amused, and hisses, "I would suggest not moving, unforgiven."

Attaining her fullest glory, the shining sun sits upon her throne at the apex 
of her daily trek through the firmament.

Ashmer backhands you painfully, and a loud &#39;SMACK&#39; resounds.

You wince in pain.

You hiss vehemently at Ashmer.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Ah, there is the anger again."

You snarl, "I do what I want, devil."

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Oh?"

You stare implacably at Ashmer.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra drags the dirk back down, stepping slowly and inaudibly 
around you in a rough circle as he pulls it lightly against your neck.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "It is a beautiful scar. I merely wished to know how it
got there."

Ashmer pales slightly.

Ashmer gasps, and glows momentarily.

You have emoted: Evangeline squirms uncomfortably as the blade slides down her 
neck, then tries to keep calm.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra continues circling, his dirk loose in his hand as it drags.

You have emoted: Evangeline glares at you angrily, her eyes still glinting 
defiantly at you.

You say, "My story, my secret. None of your business!"

Ashmer discerns someone&#39;s true loyalties.

You think of Ashmer and find that your feelings for him have changed.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Is that so?"

You snarl, "Yes."

Ashmer chews thoughtfully on his lip.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "And yet, you have given it to me."

The sun begins her downward journey towards eventual sleep, casting even, full 
light upon the land.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra idly traces the word on your forehead with a thin finger, his
eye following your gaze.

You give an icy hiss.

You snarl, "Get your filthy hands away from me, devil."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "I assure you, I have removed the blood from them."

You glare angrily at Ashmer.

You notice Ashmer&#39;s eyelids are beginning to droop.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra lowers his finger to his lips, and a pale grey tongue slides 
out, licking at its tip. He returns the finger to the center of your forehead 
and utters a sharp word in an enigmatic tongue, your body stiffening as if in 
paralysis.

You say, "W..what did yo..u..do to m..me?!"

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "I merely wish to delve into your thoughts. Not 
literally, of course, unless you refuse to speak."

The door to the  is opened from the other side.
A small beggar girl enters from the north.

Ashmer closes the door to the north.

Ashmer waves a hand dismissively at you, his attention clearly elsewhere.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "The scar is unimportant."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Though exquisite. It must have been rather painful."

A frightened orphan girl opens the door to the .
The beggar girl leaves to the north.

Ashmer closes the door to the north.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra resumes his circling, now lightly tracing his dirk over your 
face and shoulders as he steps quietly around you.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "If you could, detail how you bound Jeloseth to your 
will."

You glare angrily at Ashmer.

You say, "I used the runes that I learnt to bind him to my will, as a Sire to a
Childe bonding, though weaker in this case."

Ashmer chews thoughtfully on his lip.

The deepening dusk yields to impenetrable darkness as night claims the land.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Think of these runes. Trace them in your mind in 
blood."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Are you doing as I have asked, unforgiven? I would not
want you to be hurt if I search for something that is not there."

You have emoted: Evangeline closes her eyes as she focuses on the runes, their 
images floating in her mind.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra continues circling, an amused smirk painted across his face.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Very good."

You have emoted: Evangeline shudders slightly, then opens her eyes again. 
"I..will not do so," she says.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "But you already have, unforgiven. Defiance has failed 
you."

You open your mouth but say nothing.

Ashmer licks his lips.

The study of Vorlus.
This expansive study is lit by a sparkling chandelier in the center of the 
ceiling, which radiates a warm soft light throughout the room. The light is 
soft enough to keep the room in a state of almost perpetual twilight. The floor
consists of well polished redwood floorboards, covered in some places by large 
fluffy rugs. The walls of the room appear to have been carved out of the rock 
and left that way, giving the room the appearance of a cave. A large oak table 
sits in the center of the room, it&#39;s surface polished to perfection. It is 
surrounded by six matching chairs of the same wood, also polished and adorned 
with simple crimson cushions. Off to the rear end of the room sit a cluttered 
desk and large black chair. Books and papers are stacked in messy piles off to 
one side, the owner obviously in the middle of studies of some sort. In the 
centre of the desk lies a shimmering green crystal, one large facet of which 
has been worked to perfection. Colorful images swirl in the depths, drawing the
eyes almost hypnotically. Beside the desk sits a large plush crimson lounge 
chair and a candelabra, obviously a well used reading area. An aura of despair 
emanates from the Indorani guard that stands watch here. Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra is 
here. He wields a needled-pointed dirk in his right hand. Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra is 
here.
You see a single exit leading north(closed).

You have emoted: Evangeline shoots you a venomous glare.



The stars wink into existence, familiar constellations illuminating the night 
with tales of myth and legend.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra pointedly drags his knife across your chin as he steps in 
front of you, guiding it down across your throat as he continues to circle.

Ashmer chews thoughtfully on his lip.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Why did you bind him in this way?"

(House Voltaire): Crassus says, "Take care."

You snarl viciously at Ashmer.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "I asked you a question."

A loud and angry moaning fills the halls.

You have emoted: Evangeline tries to stop her mouth from opening to speak, but 
finds that she cannot. "I wish to corrupt and turn him into one of us 
Consanguine. Recieve the Dark Gift. Become another strong arm for the city, 
perhaps the House," she says.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "And then what will you do with him? Act as his sire? 
He is a druid."

You snarl viciously.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra pricks the flesh of your throat lightly, without piercing the
skin, and continues walking pointedly.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "The question, unforgiven."

You hiss vehemently at Ashmer.

You have emoted: Evangeline seems to take a huge effort to prevent herself from
answering you, starting to bite down upon her lips.


Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra steps in front of you and places the tip of his dirk against 
your bottom lip, pressing down slightly.

You have emoted: Evangeline cries out a little in pain as the cold blade 
presses down upon her bottom lip.

You say, "His friends forced him to turn druid. Nonetheless, I have exposed his
inner demon, and forced it to reside within his body. It will not be long... 
before he realises that the Darkness is where he belongs."

The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer&#39;s lips.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Very clever."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "I applaud your resourcefullness."

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra removes his dirk, slipping it into his sleeve once more.

You snarl viciously at Ashmer.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra dips into a low bow, raising his deep hood as he straightens 
to shadow his features.

Ashmer Ras&#39;valyra says, "Do have a good night, unforgiven. I enjoy our talks."

Ashmer opens the door to the north.

Ashmer leaves to the north.
He is followed by Ashmer.

The door to the north closes abruptly.'>Happened quite a few months ago. I figured I would share it.

You have emoted: Evangeline taps her fingers against the book she is reading,
then places it back into the bookshelf.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "You are still filled with your directionless anger,
then."

You see exits leading east and southeast.
You glare angrily at Ashmer.
You say, "What do you think?!"
Ashmer chews thoughtfully on his lip.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "This near, it is apparent."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "It rolls off of you in waves. Quite interesting, I
must say."
Ashmer licks his lips.
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Ashmer.
Ashmer takes some salve from a vial and rubs it on his skin.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Let us see..."
You stare implacably at Ashmer.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Anger without a focus, an element, is weakness."
Ashmer's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
You think of Ashmer and find that your feelings for him have changed.
Ashmer takes a long drag off his pipe.

You suddenly perceive the vague outline of an aura of rebounding around Ashmer.
Ashmer takes a long drag off his pipe.
You say, "Weakness?"
You say, "You talk to me of weakness?"
You snort arrogantly.
You say, "What do you know of it?"
The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer's lips.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "It is a weapon, for both the bearer and the others.
Only one may wield it, however."
You say, "Oh?"
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Those who cannot, perish under the yoke of the
wielder."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "What do you know of weakness, unforgiven?"
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Ashmer.
You have emoted: Evangeline appraises you for a moment, then says curtly, "I'll
rather not share them with you."
The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer's lips.
Ashmer Ras'valyra closes his mundane eye and slips his hands from his sleeves,
the dirk in his hand apparent as he slides it from its shelter.

word.

You say, "Can be purged. But anger and cruelty eliminates this weakness we all
seem to have."

This directionless anger is a weakness, a crutch and useless limb."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "It is so simple to control, to twist. It will be your
doom, should you let it purge you of your sense."

Foyer of Voltaire Library.
Light reflects off the glistening marble floor of this immense foyer which
seems to be illuminated by the keystones of giant arches high above, which glow
brightly with some arcane magic. Stretching across the ceiling a virtuoso
artist has painted a large, detailed map of Sapience. Along the wall tables
and plush sitting chairs have been arranged to facilitate quiet study. At the
far end of the room lies a grand fireplace, roaring with fire provided by gas
from a fissure underneath the fireplace. Nearby a staircase leads to the
tower, where the Voltaire Consanguine manage the House and engage in private
research. A black marble pedestal has been knocked over, cracking the bowl that
once rested upon it. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is
on the ground. There are 3 imposing Indorani guards here. Zeze wo Ozidmu du,
Countess Kiralla Koneko-Voltaire, Blood Regent is here. She wields a thin
ceremonial athame in her left hand. Crassus Koneko, Templar of Shadow is here,
shrouded. He wields a tower shield in his left hand.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast(open), west, northwest, up,
down(open) and out(open).
On a staircase.
This stairway is dark and steep and creaks with age. Portraits of lesser
noblemen are placed sporadically on the walls, which close in narrowly around
you, creating a feeling of claustrophobia. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. There are 3 imposing Indorani guards
here.
You see exits leading north, up and down.
Hallway high in the tower.
This luxurious room sits at the top of the staircase. Plush red carpeting,
ivory end tables, and gold-framed portraits lend an air of extreme wealth to
this place. There are many doors leading to private chambers from this room,
including a spiral staircase leading to a door in the ceiling.
You see exits leading northeast(closed), east(open), south(open),
southwest(closed), up(closed) and down.

consists of well polished redwood floorboards, covered in some places by large
fluffy rugs. The walls of the room appear to have been carved out of the rock
and left that way, giving the room the appearance of a cave. A large oak table
sits in the center of the room, it's surface polished to perfection. It is
surrounded by six matching chairs of the same wood, also polished and adorned
with simple crimson cushions. Off to the rear end of the room sit a cluttered
desk and large black chair. Books and papers are stacked in messy piles off to
one side, the owner obviously in the middle of studies of some sort. In the
centre of the desk lies a shimmering green crystal, one large facet of which
has been worked to perfection. Colorful images swirl in the depths, drawing the
eyes almost hypnotically. Beside the desk sits a large plush crimson lounge
chair and a candelabra, obviously a well used reading area. An aura of despair
emanates from the Indorani guard that stands watch here.
You see a single exit leading north(open).

here, shrouded. He wields a needled-pointed dirk in his right hand. Ashmer
Ras'valyra is here.
You see a single exit leading north(open).
Ashmer closes the door to the north.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Allow me to enlighten you."
Ashmer pulls at your emotional well-being.
You use your right foot to stomp on your left as hard as possible.
You bleed 10 health.
Ashmer gives you the once over.
You drive a clenched fist into your gut.
You no longer enjoy pain.
You feel Ashmer's touch heal you of illness.
Ashmer eats a lobelia seed.
Flames erupt over all over your body and begin to consume your flesh.
You take a drink from a plain wooden vial.
The elixir heals and soothes you.
You take out some salve and quickly rub it on your skin.
The raging fire about your skin goes out.
Ashmer creases his brow in a frown.
You may apply another salve to yourself.
You may drink another health or mana elixir.
Ashmer opens the door to the north.
Ashmer leaves to the north.
He is followed by Ashmer.
Ashmer arrives from the north.
He is followed by Ashmer.
Ashmer closes the door to the north.
You wince in pain.
You say, "So this is how it feels like, hmm?"
Ashmer peers at you and you feel as though you are knee-deep in thick, sticky
mud.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "So you see."
Ashmer licks his lips.
You have emoted: Evangeline coughs slightly, then glares at you. "I do not
willingly give up my feelings."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "No. You will cling to your anger."
You say, "And how are you going to make me give them up then, if that's your
intention?"
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Your hate of me for killing Jeloseth, for splitting
open his chest and slaying him in the most painful way your immortal mind could
imagine. For his begging and his screams, for his torment at the hands of the
Lord Jy'Barrak Golgotha's minions in His pits."
You smirk.
You say, "You got that right."
The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer's lips.
You point a thin ceremonial athame at Ashmer.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "No cries of protestation? No threats of my painful
demise? His end was only the beginning of his torment. You saw his heart,
ripped from his chest while it still contained his beating essence."
The loud and powerful toll of a bell fills the air with tension, as city
watchmen signal the coming of dawn.
Ashmer slowly fades into view, returning to the realm of perception.
Ashmer takes a drink from a withering presence vial.
You give a pained sigh.
You say, "I couldn't do anything to you even if I wanted."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "And why is that."
You shrug helplessly.
You say, "You'll probably do the same to me."
You say, "As what you did to Jeloseth."
You say, "No?"
You smirk.
The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer's lips.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Do you wish to hurt me? To kill me, for what I did?"
You say, "Tempting indeed.."
Your eyes twinkle enchantingly.
You say, "But no."
You smile wryly.
The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer's lips.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "So you have learnt."
You narrow your eyes at Ashmer.
Ashmer discerns someone's true loyalties.
You say, "Learnt? No..I merely wish not to dirty my hands."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "You feel fear."
You have emoted: Evangeline blinks at you, then freezes all her movements, as
if you had guessed it correctly the emotion that is going through her.
Ashmer smirks.
Ashmer Ras'valyra strides forward, the multitude of scars that cover nearly
every inch of his exposed skin becoming apparent as he nears.
Ashmer discerns someone's true loyalties.
You have emoted: Evangeline frowns slightly, then gasps in horror at the
numerous scars on your skin. "W-what's that?"
Ashmer:
He is a frog-like Grook and is a disturbing sight to behold. Smooth skin of a
sickly malachite hue clings to his thin frame, which seems to absorb and trap
the surrounding light in its tenebrous contours. A webbed crest, like a blade
of skin, cuts down across the back of his head, having taken on a murky grey
tint, nearly white on the broad flaps of skin between the thin spines. The
same murky, smoky grey swirls across the skin of his wrists and palms, slipping
through the gap between his long, thin fingers. Thin, white scars lash across
nearly every inch of his visible skin, contrasting violently with the malachite
hue. His right eye is a dull yellow, which glints eerily in the available
light, revealing jagged, crimson flecks interspersed throughout the golden orb.
His other eye, however, is a frightening sight. The skin and flesh that
surrounded it have been completely stripped away, leaving a pale, bloodshot
orb, devoid of any discernible iris and pupil, anchored to the exposed bone of
his ghastly eye socket with slight sinews. The glistening muscle entwines and
turns as the orb shifts its gaze eerily, independent of his other eye. There
is no audible hint of his presence, and his chest barely rises and falls with
each faint breath that passes his lips. His movements are smooth and measured,
giving him a disturbingly ghost-like appearance as he shifts his weight, his
subtle motion hardly noticeable to the casual eye. He stands at an odd angle,
not quite perpendicular to the ground, and seems to sway hypnotically to some
unheard rhythm, his thin, malachite lips parting slightly to reveal a set of
ebon fangs, which glisten eerily in the available light. A sinister emerald
glow issues from a grim, chaotic marking, seared into the flesh above his right
eye. A faint wisp of smoke rises from the scar, dissipating into the air with
an otherworldly hiss. He is wearing:
a leather bag
inky black robes of the Cabal
a suit of scale mail
He walks in the favor of Ere.
Ashmer Ras'valyra whips his dirk through the air in front of your face, missing
it by a fraction of an inch. "None of your concern," his hisses.
You have emoted: Evangeline jerks her head away, then starts backing away from
you a step at a time.
Rising higher in the sky, the sun illuminates the land, confining darkness to
the shadows.
Ashmer Ras'valyra rests the very tip of his thin blade at the hollow of your
throat, dragging it lightly over the flesh of your neck and tracing your own
scar without drawing blood.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "And what is this?"
You have emoted: Evangeline twists her head to the side, disturbed by the
feelings of your dirk on her neck. "Nothing you should know, " she says
harshly.
Ashmer Ras'valyra steps closer once more, the tip of his dirk tugging slightly
at your skin. "I do believe I should."
You have emoted: Evangeline purses her lips, unwilling to say another word. She
winces slightly as she feels the sharp edge of the dirk on her neck, seemingly
eager to dig into it.
Ashmer Ras'valyra.
He is 20 years old, having been born on the 16th of Slyphian, year 179 of the
Midnight Age.
He is ranked 779th in Aetolia.
He is an acceptable character.
He is a Nomad in the Fellowship of Explorers.
He is a member of the clan called 'Necromante Unicate.'
He is considered to be approximately 840% of your might.
Ashmer Ras'valyra drags the blade up and under your jaw, nonchalantly poising
the dirk so as to raise your chin to meet his gaze. "I am eager to hear the
tale."
You have emoted: Evangeline meets your gaze steadily, her eyes glinting with
what seems like defiance. "No," she utters.
Ashmer Ras'valyra grips his dirk, his gaze never leaving yours. He smirks, as
if amused, and hisses, "I would suggest not moving, unforgiven."
Attaining her fullest glory, the shining sun sits upon her throne at the apex
of her daily trek through the firmament.
Ashmer backhands you painfully, and a loud 'SMACK' resounds.
You wince in pain.
You hiss vehemently at Ashmer.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Ah, there is the anger again."
You snarl, "I do what I want, devil."
The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer's lips.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Oh?"
You stare implacably at Ashmer.
Ashmer Ras'valyra drags the dirk back down, stepping slowly and inaudibly
around you in a rough circle as he pulls it lightly against your neck.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "It is a beautiful scar. I merely wished to know how it
got there."
Ashmer pales slightly.
Ashmer gasps, and glows momentarily.
You have emoted: Evangeline squirms uncomfortably as the blade slides down her
neck, then tries to keep calm.
Ashmer Ras'valyra continues circling, his dirk loose in his hand as it drags.
You have emoted: Evangeline glares at you angrily, her eyes still glinting
defiantly at you.
You say, "My story, my secret. None of your business!"
Ashmer discerns someone's true loyalties.
You think of Ashmer and find that your feelings for him have changed.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Is that so?"
You snarl, "Yes."
Ashmer chews thoughtfully on his lip.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "And yet, you have given it to me."
The sun begins her downward journey towards eventual sleep, casting even, full
light upon the land.
Ashmer Ras'valyra idly traces the word on your forehead with a thin finger, his
eye following your gaze.
You give an icy hiss.
You snarl, "Get your filthy hands away from me, devil."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "I assure you, I have removed the blood from them."
You glare angrily at Ashmer.
You notice Ashmer's eyelids are beginning to droop.
Ashmer Ras'valyra lowers his finger to his lips, and a pale grey tongue slides
out, licking at its tip. He returns the finger to the center of your forehead
and utters a sharp word in an enigmatic tongue, your body stiffening as if in
paralysis.
You say, "W..what did yo..u..do to m..me?!"
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "I merely wish to delve into your thoughts. Not
literally, of course, unless you refuse to speak."
The door to the is opened from the other side.
A small beggar girl enters from the north.
Ashmer closes the door to the north.
Ashmer waves a hand dismissively at you, his attention clearly elsewhere.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "The scar is unimportant."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Though exquisite. It must have been rather painful."
A frightened orphan girl opens the door to the .
The beggar girl leaves to the north.
Ashmer closes the door to the north.
Ashmer Ras'valyra resumes his circling, now lightly tracing his dirk over your
face and shoulders as he steps quietly around you.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "If you could, detail how you bound Jeloseth to your
will."
You glare angrily at Ashmer.
You say, "I used the runes that I learnt to bind him to my will, as a Sire to a
Childe bonding, though weaker in this case."
Ashmer chews thoughtfully on his lip.
The deepening dusk yields to impenetrable darkness as night claims the land.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Think of these runes. Trace them in your mind in
blood."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Are you doing as I have asked, unforgiven? I would not
want you to be hurt if I search for something that is not there."
You have emoted: Evangeline closes her eyes as she focuses on the runes, their
images floating in her mind.
Ashmer Ras'valyra continues circling, an amused smirk painted across his face.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Very good."
You have emoted: Evangeline shudders slightly, then opens her eyes again.
"I..will not do so," she says.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "But you already have, unforgiven. Defiance has failed
you."
You open your mouth but say nothing.
Ashmer licks his lips.
The study of Vorlus.
This expansive study is lit by a sparkling chandelier in the center of the
ceiling, which radiates a warm soft light throughout the room. The light is
soft enough to keep the room in a state of almost perpetual twilight. The floor
consists of well polished redwood floorboards, covered in some places by large
fluffy rugs. The walls of the room appear to have been carved out of the rock
and left that way, giving the room the appearance of a cave. A large oak table
sits in the center of the room, it's surface polished to perfection. It is
surrounded by six matching chairs of the same wood, also polished and adorned
with simple crimson cushions. Off to the rear end of the room sit a cluttered
desk and large black chair. Books and papers are stacked in messy piles off to
one side, the owner obviously in the middle of studies of some sort. In the
centre of the desk lies a shimmering green crystal, one large facet of which
has been worked to perfection. Colorful images swirl in the depths, drawing the
eyes almost hypnotically. Beside the desk sits a large plush crimson lounge
chair and a candelabra, obviously a well used reading area. An aura of despair
emanates from the Indorani guard that stands watch here. Ashmer Ras'valyra is
here. He wields a needled-pointed dirk in his right hand. Ashmer Ras'valyra is
here.
You see a single exit leading north(closed).
You have emoted: Evangeline shoots you a venomous glare.
The stars wink into existence, familiar constellations illuminating the night
with tales of myth and legend.
Ashmer Ras'valyra pointedly drags his knife across your chin as he steps in
front of you, guiding it down across your throat as he continues to circle.
Ashmer chews thoughtfully on his lip.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Why did you bind him in this way?"
(House Voltaire): Crassus says, "Take care."
You snarl viciously at Ashmer.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "I asked you a question."
A loud and angry moaning fills the halls.
You have emoted: Evangeline tries to stop her mouth from opening to speak, but
finds that she cannot. "I wish to corrupt and turn him into one of us
Consanguine. Recieve the Dark Gift. Become another strong arm for the city,
perhaps the House," she says.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "And then what will you do with him? Act as his sire?
He is a druid."
You snarl viciously.
Ashmer Ras'valyra pricks the flesh of your throat lightly, without piercing the
skin, and continues walking pointedly.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "The question, unforgiven."
You hiss vehemently at Ashmer.
You have emoted: Evangeline seems to take a huge effort to prevent herself from
answering you, starting to bite down upon her lips.
Ashmer Ras'valyra steps in front of you and places the tip of his dirk against
your bottom lip, pressing down slightly.
You have emoted: Evangeline cries out a little in pain as the cold blade
presses down upon her bottom lip.
You say, "His friends forced him to turn druid. Nonetheless, I have exposed his
inner demon, and forced it to reside within his body. It will not be long...
before he realises that the Darkness is where he belongs."
The ghost of a smirk passes fleetingly over Ashmer's lips.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Very clever."
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "I applaud your resourcefullness."
Ashmer Ras'valyra removes his dirk, slipping it into his sleeve once more.
You snarl viciously at Ashmer.
Ashmer Ras'valyra dips into a low bow, raising his deep hood as he straightens
to shadow his features.
Ashmer Ras'valyra says, "Do have a good night, unforgiven. I enjoy our talks."
Ashmer opens the door to the north.
Ashmer leaves to the north.
He is followed by Ashmer.
The door to the north closes abruptly.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+1 points with 1 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
