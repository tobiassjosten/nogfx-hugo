The tunnel inclines sharply here, and a few small wisps of sulfurous air waft down from above. The sides of this tunnel are smooth, interrupted only by an occassional outcropping. The floor of the tunnel is rocky and treacherous to those not paying attention to where they are going. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A behemoth golem made of black and gold stone towers menacingly here. The monstrous form of Mephistoles is here, his stony body towering over you.


Mephistoles nods back to you before extending his right hand in front of him and motioning upwards with his palm turned towards the ceiling. A large slab of stone rises upwards in front of him, about four feet in height, three wide, and eight feet in length. Turning his fingers downwards in a subtle motion the stone obeys his whims, the surface of the stone quickly flattening and smoothing itself out into a flat, even surface. "A deep red garnet is what I will use" he hisses back to you as he turns his head over his shoulder to glance at you out of one eye. "I can do it all the way from your neck to the tip of your tail if you wish, or to the middle of your back, or stop wherever you think it best."

Natasya inches back a little, taking comfort in a more shadowy area of the tunnel as the slab falls before Mephistoles at his command. Tail 
twitching nervously behind her, she pulls her lower lip between her teeth as her gaze darts to his reptilian stare, only a soft "Um," managing to escape her before she frowns and nods. "Just to the middle of my back, where the spine of my wings begin." she says carefully, the idea causing the appendages on her back to fold together as if hiding them.

Mephistoles inhales deeply through his nostrils, his chest expanding and an 
ominous glow radiating outwards from behind his large, pointed teeth. The azudim raises both hands in front of his snout before letting his jaws swing wide and he exhales the flames across the surface of his scales for a second before snapping his jaws shut quickly. A small motion of his fingers draws sand from his raging sandstorm inwards, scouring the remains of any remaining particles on his hands away before the sand quickly darts back into the storm from whence it came. "As you wish" he says with a nod before motioning to the slab. "Certainly less painful and time consuming, though I admit I did like the idea of outlining your entire spine with bits of stone. It would be a lovely sight."

Natasya&#39;s eyes widen as the fire from Mephistoles&#39;s maw defeats the purpose of her shrouding and she watches him cleanse his hands, her form only relaxing in the slightest at the realization. She removes her pack as she 
makes her way to the slab, her small impish form propping herself on its edge as she drops her pack lazily besides the giant stone. "Let&#39;s see how this goes, and we can add more should I be tolerable of the first half of my back." she says, her lips formed in a small smile as she glances up to him expectantly.

Mephistoles walks towards you as you prop yourself against the side of the stone and reaches down, thrusting his right hand into the stone itself as if it were fluid, the material bending and molding around his scales. As he withdraws his hand you can see he&#39;s holding a small blade of stone between his claws, clearly intended for delicate work. He stares down at you, a small grin parting his lips. "It would be best if you were to lie down face first. I can do it with you sitting up but it will be far more difficult since you&#39;re much more likely to move in that position." He pauses for a moment before adding. "And you&#39;ll need to expose enough of your back for me to get to the start of your wings as well".

Natasya&#39;s eyes follow that seemingly ancient movement of Mephistoles&#39;s hand, blinking in surprise as she tilts herself out of the way, her small form tensing briefly. She turns her glowing gaze to him, nodding once before repositioning herself to her stomach on the slab, eyes darting to the 
blade in his grasp. Her arms pull back awkwardly behind her as she calmly 
unfastens each hook of her corset, decidedly letting the fabric fall to her 
sides and out of the way. With a quick movement her small wings spread outwards to either side of her, draping off of the slab of stone beneath her, ensuring they bring no obstacle or shadows over her back.

Through a worried sigh, you say, "Can you see well enough?.."

Mephistoles gives you a small nod as he watches you place yourself upon the 
slab, moving to the side of it and pushing your hair out of the way to expose the back of your neck. With two claws of his left hand he examines the flesh just below your hair line before pressing down with the ends of his fingers instead and running them down along your spine to your wings, his eyes focused and intense as he examines you, making note of the placement of your vertebrae before he returns his attention to the back of your neck. "Aye, I can see" he replies to you with a small grin parting his lips. "You are surrounded by pure earth, your flesh should be able to heal and regenerate quickly here. Focus on that after I begin, I will attempt to work quickly."

Natasya tries to remain perfectly still, only the sensation of 
his clawed fingers tickling against the flesh of her back causing her to shiver briskly. Her lips purse pensively, the tiny fangs digging into the flesh as Mephistoles hovers over her and her fingers curl at her skirt, grasping the fabric tightly in waiting. Suddenly her soft voice purrs through the tunnel, "Good luck." she quips, either out of nervousness or sincerity.

"Long ago the Teradrim belonged to Dhaivol, god of death and earth. It was then that I sought to please him with a sacrifice of flesh, that he might be able to behold the devotion of his greatest children, the teradrim. Even after the split and transformation into Lord Ivoln, he still favored this practice, and many of us have continued to honor him in this way to this day. It is now that Sister Natasya shows her devotion with this sacrifice of flesh and blood, demonstrating her devotion to the teradrim, and to Lord Ivoln, whom we still serve." As he stops speaking Mephistoles reaches out with his right hand, placing the blade against the back of yours neck on the first vertebrae below your hairline and makes a series of quick, clean incisions in your flesh, removing a piece of skin and exposing the muscle beneath. His hand is steady and practiced, and he severs
the ligaments attached to that particular vertebrae and uses his claws to gently expose the bone. As he does so a piece of garnet that he&#39;d set against the slab earlier rises into the air, hovering as he manipulates the large gemstone and coming to rest above the incision. As if it were melting a portion of the stone flows, dripping off of it and down onto your bone, mirroring the shape beneath it before the azudim skillfully arranges the severed ligaments against the stone and muttering "Focus on regenerating" before removing his claws entirely and letting the flesh close around the deep red stone which now appears as a piece of your spine jutting from your flesh.

Natasya&#39;s attention is grabbed as Mephistoles speaks, listening
carefully as though hanging on each word, her tail twitching briefly when she gets the first sensation of she sharp blade against her neck. With that same twitch of her tail, it sharply straightens and her eyes snap shut as she bites back a scream. "Mmph," she whines softly beneath his skilled hands, "I am." she accidentally snaps towards him with a restricted growl. Her skin is barely noticeably tightening around the crystal garnet and swallows roughly as he works at her muscles in her neck.

The corners of Mephistoles s mouth curl upwards into a grin as he hears you snap back at him, looking more amused than anything else. The large azudim places the palm of his left hand against be back of your head, letting it rest there for a moment as if to assure you that you are enduring the procedure quite well, before pulling it away and starting with the second one. He moves quicker than he did with the first, having gotten enough information about your body from the previous incision that he&#39;s able to perform the second one in about three fourths of the time that the first one took him. After letting the gemstone pour into the incision, molding and fusing against he bone he moves on to the next one immediately, small bands of pale skin separating the exposed red gemstones.

Natasya&#39;s small form tugs here and there about as he continues 
the procedure, her tail managing to snake itself around her wrist in a tight 
squeeze as she endures. By the next carve into her skin, her body seems to have adjusted, eyes wide still with worry, "Is.. It going.. Okay?" she says softly to Mephistoles between squints of pain. The completed stones implemented in her back have caused the skin around them to redden and swell, and their tightly fit down to the very bone of her spine and neck. She licks her lips then, worried of causing a distraction to Mephistoles, "Nevermind." she quickly withdraws her question as he skillfully embeds the stones.

"Aye, you&#39;re doing just fine and I don&#39;t see any reason to be concerned" 
Mephistoles replies to you as he finishes the one he was working on and starts on the next, the garnet hovering above you steadily while the azudim works. It&#39;s not long until you feel him moving down off of the back of your neck, the sizes of the incisions growing a little larger as your vertebrae grow larger. "I do like the look of it" he hisses to you as you feel the garnet flowing into the incision that he&#39;s working on at the moment and folding itself obediently against your bone. "The stone looks excellent against your pale skin".

Natasya tenses against the slice he makes in a new area of her flesh, and she puffs her cheeks a little with another growl, "Okay." she quickly murmurs to Mephistoles. Her amber orbs move to the hovering crystal as it hangs in the air, questions rolling through her mind which quickly disappear due to the painful distraction of the incisions. The imp&#39;s wings twitch briefly and she blushes, "Thanks." she says indecisively as the crystal moves from her view and she closes her eyes to focus purely on regenerating the muscle to attach itself around the garnet tightly.

Through clenched teeth, you say, "For all of this, Mephistoles. I have no 
regrets in requesting this help from you."

Mephistoles&#39;s hands pause for a brief moment as he sees your wings move, wary of shifts in the muscle and tissue close to them before he proceeds. Nearly done, the azudim starts the last incision a little slower than before, working more carefully now that he&#39;s closer to your wings. However the anatomy of an imp doesn&#39;t seem to be foreign to him, and though the additional muscles and tendons associated with your wings do force him to move a little slower, he proceeds much as before. As the gemstone fills the last incision he drops the stone blade from between his fingers, letting it disappear and meld back into the stone from which it came before letting his eyes examine his work. He grins broadly as he looks at you, nodding his head several times before gently placing his right hand against the back of your left shoulder. "We&#39;re done" he hisses to you. "For now at least. Although, if you want to take a look and decide you want it all the way down your spine I certainly have the time."

Natasya&#39;s amber eyes go hidden beneath her lids as the largest of the incisions is put in motion, the feeling of Mephistoles pulling and tugging at her flesh almost making her dizzy. "Mmn.." she groans softly, "Continue." she says shortly as beads of sweat break from her brow. "It only feels half.. Finished now." she adds quietly as she concentrates once more on the string of garnet lining her vertebrae, ensuring each is in the continual motion of regenerating and adhering completely.'>Small rocky incline.
