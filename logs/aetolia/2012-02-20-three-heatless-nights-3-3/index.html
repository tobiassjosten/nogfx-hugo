The cave presses in tight around you; the moths are no longer with you, and there is an absence of sensation as you awaken. ...Is it awakening, though, or just another level to the hallucinations and dreams that have helped to pass the long period of isolation? You can hear footsteps, circling above you.

You have emoted: Lin, barely breathing, barely conscious, tries to lift her head. The frost in her hair strains and crackles but she remains immobile. The only indication she has recognized the sound is a faint pulse in her throat, motion beneath her eyelids as she tries to open them.

You have emoted: Lin loses track easily, and begins to drift off again, but something urgent strikes her, and she gathers her strength, flexing her fingers and wiggling her toes until her circulation improves, then weakly lifts her head, trying to cry out, her voice a barely-audible croak.

A harsh, endless tundra under driving snow.
Swirling snow falls from an amaranthine sky of frosty, wintry grey. The ashen clouds blot out the sun, obscuring direction in an endless field of ambiguous white. Details of the bleak landscape are imperceptible amid the interminable blizzard, cutting winds sweeping drifts of snow to meet falling flakes in a constant shift, bearing a chill that bites deep. Any footprints upon the treacherously icy tundra are filled but moments after their birth. Despite air crisp and fresh, the tundra is cold and inhospitable, with nothing but the promise of frigid death in every direction.
Exits: west.

The earth gives; a hand stabs downward; and then you feel it groping, moving, SEARCHING for you.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s eyes snap open, but all she can do, it seems, is stare at the hand in horror, pressing her back against the walls of what was once her shelter, but feels tantamount to a trap. She begins to grunt and moan fretfully, her teeth bared, shooting jets of fogging breath.

It reaches out to one side, then the other, fingers twisting slowly in the dim air like a purple spider. Claws extend; one grazes your skin, drags through the coating of frost, and blood slowly - too slowly to be healthy - wells up from the shallow graze it creates. The pain is slow to reach you, too, only numbness predominating in the first moments.

You have emoted: Lin struggles again, willing her frozen limbs to move, and when they refuse to do so, cold panic floods her mind. A slow wash of pain overcomes her, making her mouth hang open as she moans incoherently, losing consciousness for several seconds. Her eyes follow the every movement of the hand, her mouth leaking primitive, terrified wailing noise.

The hand pauses with a minute twitch, fingers splayed, claws wicked and gleaming; and then it lunges forward, SEIZING you around the throat, choking you, making the cold air burn harsh in your compressed windpipe. It TIGHTENS. It DEMANDS. You can do NOTHING to stop it.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s mouth yawns open, and her fingers twitch, but her body is simultaneously stiffened and limp, like choking a doll. Robbed of the ability to even vocalize, she screams in silence, her jewel-like eyes going pale as she simply and abruptly begins to go into shock.

As your vision goes spotty and black, the hand taking what little remains, you find that there is a still deeper level of awareness, of consciousness; and you are face to face with the Underking, an hourglass behind him draining its last few grains of sand. The Lord stares upon you for a few moments, and then is gone, His footprints leaving a path, a STAIRCASE downward. You find that you can move, again; here, in the midnight dark, the hourglass emptied, there is no way but forward.

You have emoted: Lin freezes, metaphorically this time, at the top of the staircase, feeling her hair stand on end. No fear she has felt on this abortive journey can compare to the dread that picks knots into her spine. Horrid visions of undeath lure foremost in her mind, rotting limbs, gnarled teeth and putrid guts spilling into dank pits. She refuses to descend, the curved hooks of her toes gripping the stairs.

You can feel the cold at your back, ice crystals stinging you, whipping you. The cold has banished you from your body, inch by inch, and now you have only the vaguest claim to it. The hourglass is enormous, defying description, defying DIMENSION, looming over you, and at the bottom you see your name writ in all the tongues of mortalkind, all the different names. Lin, Iro, shavora... It makes no difference, none at all, for they all mean YOU.

Deepest Haernos, deepest cold; and then flute music echoes to you, from somewhere distant. Dissonant, disarrayed, arhythmic, but with a deeper melody that transcends such immaterial concerns. It sinks right into your feet, warms them, DEMANDS that they move, leap, twirl.

You have emoted: Lin gulps powerfully, finding herself distracted, for but a fleeting moment, nearly agonizing relief at regaining the function of her body. Emboldened, her ears flicker forward, picking up the skeins of music. The image of Seir leaps to the front of her mind - mostly a correlation, but not without a brief fondness. Her tail begins to sway for the first time in what feels like decades, and slowly, cold sweat dripping down her face, she descends the stairs into the black.

You&#39;re swept forward, the music growing louder, echoes refracting it, changing it, producing harmony from dissonance, melody from chaos. Moths swirl and dance around you, not just purple but all the colors of the rainbow, and the stairs grow steeper and steeper, defying you to keep your footing. Motes of sand fall around you, some bouncing on the staircase; you feel them underfoot, making the passage yet more treacherous, each one a memory in miniature, each one a recollection. All the different Lins dance through your head, a recollection of what once was. Until finally, at the very bottom, you face yourself again. A reflection, like the one in the forest. This time, though, it&#39;s just a mirror.

The Underking&#39;s mirror.

You have emoted: "You..." Lin says softly, reaching up to stroke at her throat. She approaches the mirror up to arm&#39;s length, breathing steadily through her nose, feeling all of the anxiety, fear, unsurety, all surrendering to curiosity, resolve, excitement for what is to come. She reaches out slowly and grazes the glass with her nails.

The screech silences the music; instead, there is only SILENCE, echoing, resounding, and then the figure in the mirror is no longer imitating you. Instead, her eyes wide, her body fluid and strong, she raises her chin, poises herself, and begins to dance. It&#39;s slow, unstructured, arhythmic, following sheer impulse and sensation rather than any tune. She catches you with her eyes, again and again, smiling beguilingly, grains of sand falling upward in the picture around her, moths swirling and ascending in a tornado of furious color.

You have emoted: Lin watches, mesmerized, reluctantly glancing about her, at the darkness, at the dreary staircase which already becomes too difficult to make out. The hourglass brings only negative feelings. Instead, she presses to the glass, watching her reflection move, watching her dance. She finds herself sliding back, making room, her hips swaying and her long legs pivoting, kicking away from the floor. She dances sensually, desperately, laughing at how good it feels, and simultaneously how much it hurts, and she is unsure whether this will save her, or serve as simply a final kindness before her time is over.

Heat comes back, and fire, and PAIN. Parts of your body are numb, DEAD, much like the forest, much like the ice, but you defy it this time, you defy the blackness, and the hourglass starts to echo, sing, as you drive the sand back upward, dancing. The moths join you, summoned by the sole light of life that exists in this black alcove of the Underking&#39;s Hall. Purple, red, blue, fire, ice... they swirl around you, closer and closer, melting into a colorful landscape, following you, a single dancer in the midnight dark.

Tears flow freely from your eyes as your beloved God promotes you to a Dancer in the Midnight Dark.

You have emoted: Lin cries out aloud, her voice straining to contain the tidal surge of emotion that struggles to be heard, laughing as she spins, weaving through lights, moths and smears of beautiful hues. She continues to dance even after she has grown exhausted, no longer leaping and spiraling but moving in a slow, hypnotic sway, her heart pounding hard in her breast. Tears of sand streaming down her face, she whispers, "I dance for You... I dance for the world. I will never die so long as I dance."

You feel yourself rising, exultant, full of fire and passion, the staircase melting away beneath your feet as you climb back upward. "Dance WITH the world, Dancer," comes the whisper, the moths together forming them from the noise of their wingbeats. "Not FOR them. For you are WITH them, if you live, if you are not DEAD, if you are not FROZEN." As you rise again, you circle the hourglass, watch it somehow reverse itself, a rivulet of sand pouring into the top bulb. The freezing cold is growing nearer, and you can see the ice crystals dancing. "Go. Back to the cold."

You have emoted: Lin braces herself, her gut clenching, ready again for the snow. She brings with her a sharp, nearly painful feeling of love buried deep in her breast, and as she begins to feel her frozen cloak about her body, her limbs losing their sensation, she smiles.

You flee the Underking&#39;s Hall, moths dancing around you, one moment full of energy, and the next, the NEXT... barely alive, but clinging to what little is there. Your throat aches. It burns.


    --> --> -->


You tell Kiyotan, "Ki... yo... tan..."

Kiyotan tells you, "Has it been a month already? Alright, stay put, I am coming."

You have emoted: Lin relaxes, as much as one can do anything -but- relax in such a condition, breathing as slowly as possible. She is freezing, numb to the core, but hopeful.

Kiyotan arrives from the west.

You have emoted: Lin is nowhere to be seen, though to all conventional and unconventional senses she should be in this very spot. What -is- noticeable, however, is the slightest mound in the snow, a lumpen shape that refuses to conform to the otherwise flat tundra.

Kiyotan strides through the snow with a purposeful gait, somehow unhindered by the treacherous terrain underfoot. The cold does not seem to touch him, despite being barefoot and topless, yet the wind whips his hair about. His eye narrows at the conspicuous lump and he marches over to it. Behind him, coruscating flame abruptly swells into a massive pair of wings, dwarfing the man between them, and swing forward in a huge, soundless clap, creating a gust that blows the layer of snow clean off the unidentified shape.

You have emoted: The snow scathes away in an erratic scar, guided by the tremendous clap of heated air. You unearth a burrow, its walls packed harder than the fallen snow of the surface, and at the bottom, blanketed in her cloak and half-submerged in snow, is Lin, curled up in a fetal position. She appears dead, her skin discolored so that it nearly looks violet, frost spiderwebbing over her hair and fusing her eyelashes shut.

Kiyotan drops into a squat, peering into the burrow. Lips form a thin line before he shakes his head disappointedly. Standing up straight, his chest swell as he draws a deep breath, then promptly exhales it through pursed lips. It leaves his mouth in a gout of white-hot flame, reducing the burrow to water and steam around you. He is careful to avoid sweeping the blaze across your swaddled form and, when there is enough room for him to reach you, he crawls toward you and settles in a kneel before you. Delicately he slips his arms beneath you and stands, blazing wings melting what remains of the burrow as he cradles you against him.

Orisae tells you, "Hm?"

You have emoted: Lin comes to life promptly in Kiyotan&#39;s arms, a delicate swelling to her chest as she takes slow, shallow breaths. Lines form tight around her eyes as she tries to open them, breaking through the frost buildup. Narrowed and devoid of sense, she regards Kiyotan with a faint smile, but doesn&#39;t really appear to see him, her lips moving in sluggish silence. The metalwork around her horns, however, takes on a faint blue glow, unmistakable and familiar warmth emanating from the decor.

You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Oh, awake... been... asleep so long."

You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Hhhello, shavora..."

Orisae tells you, "I have some pots and pans, dearest. Would you like me to clank them together for you to grant you a touch of clarity?"

Orisae tells you, "Are you able to speak and see?"

You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Can see... not... s-s-speak. Someone carrying me... can&#39;t feel snow."

Orisae tells you, "Lin. Are you freezing to death?"

You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Ha... ha, ha... no, no, not anymore, b-beloved..."

"Just be still," Kiyotan gently but firmly instructs as he backpedals away from the melted burrow. Holding you steadily, he traispes in a direction that, to you, must appear to have been chosen at random. That is, until the gaps between the snow begin to brighten and the wind begins to recede.

Orisae tells you, "Tch... Lin, where are you? You are not a creature of snow and ice! Tell me where you are. Who carries you?"

You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Somewhere flat and grey... c-c-carried by... Samrata, emperor... n-named Kiyotan... peace, sshhhavora... everything is good."

Orisae tells you, "You are insufferable and lost."

The center of an infinite crossroads. (The Havens.) (20132)
Amid an endless field of green grass, a crossroads of beaten earth divides, each leg stretching off into an unchanging horizon, static scenery as far as the eye can see. The dirt paths are razor-straight and wide enough for ten men to walk shoulder-to-shoulder. Overhead, the sky is a perpetual grey haze, forever casting these fields in wan, pale light. Standing out in stark foreignness, the very center of the crossroads&#39;s joint bears a small raised dais of white marble, upon which stands a golden throne. Wrought with elegant and meticulous care and draped with luxurious velvet, this seat bears an alien beauty, exquisite but for its bizarre and alien presence in an otherwise empty field. Kiyotan is here.
Exits: north, east, south, and west.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s flesh is so cold it almost burns. She lies limp in Kiyotan&#39;s arms, but her fingers and toes are trapped in a stiffened curl. She shows signs of immediate recovery, but babbles like an infant, her eyes darting everywhere.

Orisae tells you, in Harpy, "..are you at least moving?"

Kiyotan&#39;s trek is kept at a moderate pace; purposeful without being hasty. The empty white soon adopts the color of the cloudless sky, followed thereafter by the grass framing the road. Before long, the familiar sound of dirt beneath his feet concludes the transition back to the vast plain. He meets the crossroad from the eastern spur and continues straight westward, walking towards that featureless nothing until, once again, everything fades to white.

You just received message #5832 from Kiyotan.

Message #5832  Sent By: Kiyotan         Received On: 2/20/2012/2:54
"(Tempted to lick lin and see if tongue sticks)."

You sent the following message to Kiyotan:
(( eeeeeewwwwwwww ))

You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "I am... oh, oh... so much warmer now. Gods... must have been... asleep... ages. Oh, so warm."

Orisae tells you, in Harpy, "Can you describe your surroundings, love?"

You follow Kiyotan to the west.

Vast cavern beneath an active volcano. (The Havens.) (20749)
A palpable heat permeates the cavern, the warmth just shy of uncomfortable, humidity and the faint scent of sulphur carried with it. The ground underfoot, above and around is made of smooth, level black rock, and though navigating the cavern is made somewhat treacherous by the stalagmites and stalactites that bite up from above and below, other stone formations have created natural shelves and striated slopes, appearing comparatively comfortable. A few steam vents rise up from the ground, spewing heated, billowing clouds of gas that hangs in the air and obscures the farther reaches of the cavern in its grayish cloud. Here and there cracks have developed in the rock from mounted pressure beneath, rivulets of lava making jagged seams throughout the cavern, the ominous red-orange glow illuminating the grotto. Kiyotan is here.
Exits: east.

You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Just a cave... very long, very dark cave. Don&#39;t remember being carried here, must... must be because I am frozen... he moves sometimes, dodges stalactites."

Orisae tells you, "Kiyotan?"

You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Yes."

Orisae tells you, "Well, at least you have someone where you are, Shavora. You are in a place, as usual, where I cannot go."

You have emoted: Lin makes a dry croaking noise, and then, in the first patch of Aetolian she has spoken since Kiyotan found her, she asks, "Throat... hurts... water?" Her breathing has quickened, her pulse recovering, as quickly and dramatically as an Albedi engine warming up.

The smell of sulphur is the first to permeate the voidspace, followed by a suffusing heat so thick, it&#39;s almost tangible. Despite this, like before, Kiyotan seems untouched by the temperature. He navigates the craggy cavern with the ease of familiarity until he comes to a shelf of rock in a curious chair shape. It&#39;s across this that he carefully drapes your body, head propped up on one &#39;arm,&#39; legs draped over the other. The stone itself is comfortingly warm, and the molten rock glowing in cracks amid the cavern walls provide an encompassing, relaxing heat. He straightens up and looks down at you, arms at his sides, schooling the look of concern into an expression of expectation. At your request, he presents a cup.

Kiyotan gives a delicate, hand-painted cup to you.

You are holding:
"cup237125"              a delicate, hand-painted cup (hot hazelnut and vanilla kawhe).

You have emoted: Lin bends her fingers with what looks to be supreme effort around the curve of the cup. She merely lifts it to her lips, inhaling the vapors of the beverage, a little confused at the smell but too eager to care. After warming her face on its steam, she slowly tries to upend the cup into her mouth, drinking greedily of the kawhe, which dribbles and spills down her face and body.

Cupping your hands around a delicate, hand-painted cup of steaming hazelnul and vanilla kawhe, you bring it up to your lips and take a slow sip, the rich flavors pleasing to the taste and the delicious aroma wafting off the surface into your face. Proving to be good for any cold day, the kawhe leaves you feeling warm from head to toe.

"Hey, hey," Kiyotan chides, reaching forward to tilt the cup backwards to moderate your intake, lest you choke. With a healer&#39;s trained eye, he continues to quietly monitor your hypothermic recovery. "You looked cozy," he finally murmurs through a small, lopsided smirk.

You have emoted: Lin lowers the cup to gasp for breath, moisture running down the sides of her face. She turns ever so slightly, her face smushed up against the arm of the chairlike stone, gazing into space with that distant expression. "Tried to... keep walking, at first... thought I would walk for a whole month. Then... everything got complicated." Her brow knits as she frowns thoughtfully.

You have emoted: Suddenly, Lin gives in to a violent shiver, curling tightly in her seat, her arms wrapping tightly around her. She moans loudly, her voice edged with pain.

Kiyotan&#39;s eyebrows furrow, concern making cracks in his indifferent mask. "I thought you monks were supposed to embody discipline," he remarks softly, nudging your legs to make room for himself to sit on the shelf of stone opposite your head. At the sudden shiver, he jolts in surprise, reaching his bare left hand out to your forehead. "What is it?" he asks, failing to completely mask his worry behind sarcasm. "Have you taken ill?"

You have emoted: Lin is motionless, locked into her fetal curl. Her forehead blazes beneath Kiyotan&#39;s hand, in stark contrast to the chill that still lingers beneath the rest of her flesh. She breathes loudly in slow-paced gasps, whispering, "Trying to... trying to see... trying to... large, all so large..."

A look of gravity flashes across Kiyotan&#39;s face before he withdraws his hand. "Yes, it&#39;s something I hear often," he distractedly remarks, reaching to squeeze your shoulder. Immediately upon contact, you can feel a blanket of protection drape upon you, like a phantom shroud. The Yeleni then murmurs incomprehensibly sussurating words, and a &#39;circle&#39; of light glows in the rock beneath you, the shape of the stone warping the luminescent ring. Its interior suddenly fills with a dizzying latticework of light, the rejuvenation aura invoked.

You have emoted: Lin falls silent for a long time, light playing over skin that acquires its healthy brown tone. She keeps the cup cradled loosely in her hands at an angle, the kawhe on the verge of spilling, but never making the edge. Over time, she sounds off intermittently - first, more of &#39;large&#39; things, but they seem to become smaller, easier to grasp and encompass. Then, in the Fae tongue, "Claws... so angry... beat the walls, beat the walls... choking me..." But this too passes, and when she next opens her eyes, they are full of life, a clarity of focus present, her line of sight sharp. She sits up, slowly, surprised to find Kiyotan so close.

You have emoted: "Was it just a month...?" Lin asks.

The sag of Kiyotan&#39;s shoulders betrays his relief. "Maybe a day or two less," he muses softly, sucking his lower lip into his mouth. Again, he reaches a hand out to touch your forehead. "How do you feel?"

You have emoted: At Kiyotan&#39;s contact, Lin&#39;s eyelids drop. A fluttery breath escapes her lips. "Ver- very... very quiet, inside. Want to leave here, so much that I know but can&#39;t think..." Her arms wind tightly around her chest, and she leans gently into Kiyotan&#39;s hand.

Kiyotan&#39;s mouth curves into a frown. "I am sorry," he says under his breath. "This was..not supposed to be about survival." Reluctantly, he withdraws his hand from your forehead. "We can go if you think you can stand."

You have emoted: Lin does seem to think so, but fails on the first try, heaving up from the chair and teetering on untrustworthy legs. Falling unceremoniously back into her seat, she pauses, sips a breath, braces herself, and tries again, this time standing as if there were no difficulty in the first place, though her posture droops. "Could survive," she says quietly, her voice impossibly hoarse. "If it was only snow..."

Kiyotan turns his head to favor you with a side-eyed look of suspicion. "What else was there?" he carefully queries.

You have emoted: Lin only shakes her head, pointing at her throat. She heaves her cloak up from the seat and tugs it over her shoulders like a blanket, though the heavy fur is damp with melted ice. Staring off into the distance, she appears to be looking for an exit, her head darting about hastily as one fails to present itself.

Kiyotan takes his cue and flows from the chair to a standing position. He hesitates for a moment, looking thoughtfully at you. Whatever he was debated, though, he appears to have decided against, and simply turns, heading further into the heat of the volcano, gesturing for you to follow.

You have emoted: Lin is slow on her feet, plodding after Kiyotan in the dark. She hunches like a crone beneath her covering, wordless and shaken.


    --> --> -->


Back in the center of the paths&#39; convergence, Kiyotan finally halts, turning to watch you make up the ground between you. When you draw near, he holds his hand out to you. "The Pride welcomes you back, Sentinel. Redeemed."

You have emoted: Lin stares at Kiyotan for a long time, just taking a moment to make a connection in his eyes, as if trying to remember how to establish contact. Then, her eyes drop down to his hand, and after another long pause, she reaches out and extends a palm, sliding it a ways past his hand to grasp his wrist instead. Her strength is renewed, her grip tight, and a smile works its way across her face, weak but sincere. "Thank you," she whispers.

Kiyotan nods his head conclusively, and sweeps his free hand across his body, sending the world around you to spinning, the colors becoming a blurry morass, losing shape and meaning.

You follow Kiyotan to the ether.

The broad porch of a small bungalow.
A small set of stairs separates the bungalow from the jungle garden. Raised several feet from the ground, this wide wooden porch offers a broad view of the eastern Itzatl. With exotic gardens and rainforest surrounding, there is a riot of color in every direction. The porch itself is simplistic, sparsely furnished with only a few stools and a cozy swing, and protected from the jungle showers beneath a wide overhang from which dangle a variety of vines. The smell of fresh earth mingles with the scent of sawdust from the bungalow&#39;s wooden frame, an aromatic hint of the rainforest&#39;s more exotic flora teasing the senses. Looking onto the porch are twin circular glass-paneled windows, separated in the middle by a door of the same plain wood that comprises the rest of the secluded residence. A hammock-swing occupies the space here, invitingly. The warrior-priestess Klaana stands here. Kiyotan is here.
Exits: east and west (closed pine door).

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s eyes widen at her surroundings, the house unfamiliar to her. Her tail stops and lies still on the ground as she looks to Kiyotan with confusion. "Where are we?"

Kiyotan releases your hand and casually drops into the hammock-swing a pace away. "A safe place," he responds through a genial smile. "We are on the outskirts of Saluria."

You have emoted: "Oh," Lin says simply, glancing about with concern. "I have preyed often on these people..." Her demeanor changes, now that she is back in the real world, her posture lower to the ground, her legs bunched tight with muscle that remembers how to move and shift. She looks, as ever, ready to spring away at high speeds, but instead of leaving, or qualifying her non-sequitur, she kneels before Kiyotan in the seat and throws an arm over him, resting her head on his chest.

Kiyotan freezes in surprise when you knelt at his feet, "Wha--" all he manages before you sprawl upon him. Bewilderment conquers his demeanor as he looks down at you, but gradually loses its grasp. With reluctance, he drapes his arms around your shoulders, his chin atop your head. And finally, his eye closes, and the Yeleni surrenders.

You have emoted: Lin murmurs nonsense into Kiyotan&#39;s chest, her hands trembling. Brimming with emotion, she nudges her head into the curve of Kiyotan&#39;s throat, eager to continue grasping on for just a little while - the first contact she&#39;s had in a whole month. When she pulls away, at last, she curls her arms tightly around her body, smiling worriedly. "Glad to be back," she says. "Tha- thank you."

At a loss for anything meaningful to say, Kiyotan can only nod his head once in acknowledgement. When you shift away, his arms drop limply into his lap, and he looks a little bit dazed.

You have emoted: Lin does dart away this time, but it is only her nature. As she left, she looked most encouraged - hopeful, even.'>_________________
_ __ ________/ Day Twenty-Four \________ __ _
The cave presses in tight around you; the moths are no longer with you, and there is an absence of sensation as you awaken. ...Is it awakening, though, or just another level to the hallucinations and dreams that have helped to pass the long period of isolation? You can hear footsteps, circling above you.
You have emoted: Lin, barely breathing, barely conscious, tries to lift her head. The frost in her hair strains and crackles but she remains immobile. The only indication she has recognized the sound is a faint pulse in her throat, motion beneath her eyelids as she tries to open them.
You have emoted: Lin loses track easily, and begins to drift off again, but something urgent strikes her, and she gathers her strength, flexing her fingers and wiggling her toes until her circulation improves, then weakly lifts her head, trying to cry out, her voice a barely-audible croak.
A harsh, endless tundra under driving snow.
Swirling snow falls from an amaranthine sky of frosty, wintry grey. The ashen clouds blot out the sun, obscuring direction in an endless field of ambiguous white. Details of the bleak landscape are imperceptible amid the interminable blizzard, cutting winds sweeping drifts of snow to meet falling flakes in a constant shift, bearing a chill that bites deep. Any footprints upon the treacherously icy tundra are filled but moments after their birth. Despite air crisp and fresh, the tundra is cold and inhospitable, with nothing but the promise of frigid death in every direction.
Exits: west.
The earth gives; a hand stabs downward; and then you feel it groping, moving, SEARCHING for you.
You have emoted: Lin's eyes snap open, but all she can do, it seems, is stare at the hand in horror, pressing her back against the walls of what was once her shelter, but feels tantamount to a trap. She begins to grunt and moan fretfully, her teeth bared, shooting jets of fogging breath.
It reaches out to one side, then the other, fingers twisting slowly in the dim air like a purple spider. Claws extend; one grazes your skin, drags through the coating of frost, and blood slowly - too slowly to be healthy - wells up from the shallow graze it creates. The pain is slow to reach you, too, only numbness predominating in the first moments.
You have emoted: Lin struggles again, willing her frozen limbs to move, and when they refuse to do so, cold panic floods her mind. A slow wash of pain overcomes her, making her mouth hang open as she moans incoherently, losing consciousness for several seconds. Her eyes follow the every movement of the hand, her mouth leaking primitive, terrified wailing noise.
The hand pauses with a minute twitch, fingers splayed, claws wicked and gleaming; and then it lunges forward, SEIZING you around the throat, choking you, making the cold air burn harsh in your compressed windpipe. It TIGHTENS. It DEMANDS. You can do NOTHING to stop it.
You have emoted: Lin's mouth yawns open, and her fingers twitch, but her body is simultaneously stiffened and limp, like choking a doll. Robbed of the ability to even vocalize, she screams in silence, her jewel-like eyes going pale as she simply and abruptly begins to go into shock.
As your vision goes spotty and black, the hand taking what little remains, you find that there is a still deeper level of awareness, of consciousness; and you are face to face with the Underking, an hourglass behind him draining its last few grains of sand. The Lord stares upon you for a few moments, and then is gone, His footprints leaving a path, a STAIRCASE downward. You find that you can move, again; here, in the midnight dark, the hourglass emptied, there is no way but forward.
You have emoted: Lin freezes, metaphorically this time, at the top of the staircase, feeling her hair stand on end. No fear she has felt on this abortive journey can compare to the dread that picks knots into her spine. Horrid visions of undeath lure foremost in her mind, rotting limbs, gnarled teeth and putrid guts spilling into dank pits. She refuses to descend, the curved hooks of her toes gripping the stairs.
You can feel the cold at your back, ice crystals stinging you, whipping you. The cold has banished you from your body, inch by inch, and now you have only the vaguest claim to it. The hourglass is enormous, defying description, defying DIMENSION, looming over you, and at the bottom you see your name writ in all the tongues of mortalkind, all the different names. Lin, Iro, shavora... It makes no difference, none at all, for they all mean YOU.
Deepest Haernos, deepest cold; and then flute music echoes to you, from somewhere distant. Dissonant, disarrayed, arhythmic, but with a deeper melody that transcends such immaterial concerns. It sinks right into your feet, warms them, DEMANDS that they move, leap, twirl.
You have emoted: Lin gulps powerfully, finding herself distracted, for but a fleeting moment, nearly agonizing relief at regaining the function of her body. Emboldened, her ears flicker forward, picking up the skeins of music. The image of Seir leaps to the front of her mind - mostly a correlation, but not without a brief fondness. Her tail begins to sway for the first time in what feels like decades, and slowly, cold sweat dripping down her face, she descends the stairs into the black.
You're swept forward, the music growing louder, echoes refracting it, changing it, producing harmony from dissonance, melody from chaos. Moths swirl and dance around you, not just purple but all the colors of the rainbow, and the stairs grow steeper and steeper, defying you to keep your footing. Motes of sand fall around you, some bouncing on the staircase; you feel them underfoot, making the passage yet more treacherous, each one a memory in miniature, each one a recollection. All the different Lins dance through your head, a recollection of what once was. Until finally, at the very bottom, you face yourself again. A reflection, like the one in the forest. This time, though, it's just a mirror.
The Underking's mirror.
You have emoted: "You..." Lin says softly, reaching up to stroke at her throat. She approaches the mirror up to arm's length, breathing steadily through her nose, feeling all of the anxiety, fear, unsurety, all surrendering to curiosity, resolve, excitement for what is to come. She reaches out slowly and grazes the glass with her nails.
The screech silences the music; instead, there is only SILENCE, echoing, resounding, and then the figure in the mirror is no longer imitating you. Instead, her eyes wide, her body fluid and strong, she raises her chin, poises herself, and begins to dance. It's slow, unstructured, arhythmic, following sheer impulse and sensation rather than any tune. She catches you with her eyes, again and again, smiling beguilingly, grains of sand falling upward in the picture around her, moths swirling and ascending in a tornado of furious color.
You have emoted: Lin watches, mesmerized, reluctantly glancing about her, at the darkness, at the dreary staircase which already becomes too difficult to make out. The hourglass brings only negative feelings. Instead, she presses to the glass, watching her reflection move, watching her dance. She finds herself sliding back, making room, her hips swaying and her long legs pivoting, kicking away from the floor. She dances sensually, desperately, laughing at how good it feels, and simultaneously how much it hurts, and she is unsure whether this will save her, or serve as simply a final kindness before her time is over.
Heat comes back, and fire, and PAIN. Parts of your body are numb, DEAD, much like the forest, much like the ice, but you defy it this time, you defy the blackness, and the hourglass starts to echo, sing, as you drive the sand back upward, dancing. The moths join you, summoned by the sole light of life that exists in this black alcove of the Underking's Hall. Purple, red, blue, fire, ice... they swirl around you, closer and closer, melting into a colorful landscape, following you, a single dancer in the midnight dark.
Tears flow freely from your eyes as your beloved God promotes you to a Dancer in the Midnight Dark.
You have emoted: Lin cries out aloud, her voice straining to contain the tidal surge of emotion that struggles to be heard, laughing as she spins, weaving through lights, moths and smears of beautiful hues. She continues to dance even after she has grown exhausted, no longer leaping and spiraling but moving in a slow, hypnotic sway, her heart pounding hard in her breast. Tears of sand streaming down her face, she whispers, "I dance for You... I dance for the world. I will never die so long as I dance."
You feel yourself rising, exultant, full of fire and passion, the staircase melting away beneath your feet as you climb back upward. "Dance WITH the world, Dancer," comes the whisper, the moths together forming them from the noise of their wingbeats. "Not FOR them. For you are WITH them, if you live, if you are not DEAD, if you are not FROZEN." As you rise again, you circle the hourglass, watch it somehow reverse itself, a rivulet of sand pouring into the top bulb. The freezing cold is growing nearer, and you can see the ice crystals dancing. "Go. Back to the cold."
You have emoted: Lin braces herself, her gut clenching, ready again for the snow. She brings with her a sharp, nearly painful feeling of love buried deep in her breast, and as she begins to feel her frozen cloak about her body, her limbs losing their sensation, she smiles.
You flee the Underking's Hall, moths dancing around you, one moment full of energy, and the next, the NEXT... barely alive, but clinging to what little is there. Your throat aches. It burns.
--> --> -->
You tell Kiyotan, "Ki... yo... tan..."
Kiyotan tells you, "Has it been a month already? Alright, stay put, I am coming."
You have emoted: Lin relaxes, as much as one can do anything -but- relax in such a condition, breathing as slowly as possible. She is freezing, numb to the core, but hopeful.
Kiyotan arrives from the west.
You have emoted: Lin is nowhere to be seen, though to all conventional and unconventional senses she should be in this very spot. What -is- noticeable, however, is the slightest mound in the snow, a lumpen shape that refuses to conform to the otherwise flat tundra.
Kiyotan strides through the snow with a purposeful gait, somehow unhindered by the treacherous terrain underfoot. The cold does not seem to touch him, despite being barefoot and topless, yet the wind whips his hair about. His eye narrows at the conspicuous lump and he marches over to it. Behind him, coruscating flame abruptly swells into a massive pair of wings, dwarfing the man between them, and swing forward in a huge, soundless clap, creating a gust that blows the layer of snow clean off the unidentified shape.
You have emoted: The snow scathes away in an erratic scar, guided by the tremendous clap of heated air. You unearth a burrow, its walls packed harder than the fallen snow of the surface, and at the bottom, blanketed in her cloak and half-submerged in snow, is Lin, curled up in a fetal position. She appears dead, her skin discolored so that it nearly looks violet, frost spiderwebbing over her hair and fusing her eyelashes shut.
Kiyotan drops into a squat, peering into the burrow. Lips form a thin line before he shakes his head disappointedly. Standing up straight, his chest swell as he draws a deep breath, then promptly exhales it through pursed lips. It leaves his mouth in a gout of white-hot flame, reducing the burrow to water and steam around you. He is careful to avoid sweeping the blaze across your swaddled form and, when there is enough room for him to reach you, he crawls toward you and settles in a kneel before you. Delicately he slips his arms beneath you and stands, blazing wings melting what remains of the burrow as he cradles you against him.
Orisae tells you, "Hm?"
You have emoted: Lin comes to life promptly in Kiyotan's arms, a delicate swelling to her chest as she takes slow, shallow breaths. Lines form tight around her eyes as she tries to open them, breaking through the frost buildup. Narrowed and devoid of sense, she regards Kiyotan with a faint smile, but doesn't really appear to see him, her lips moving in sluggish silence. The metalwork around her horns, however, takes on a faint blue glow, unmistakable and familiar warmth emanating from the decor.
You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Oh, awake... been... asleep so long."
You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Hhhello, shavora..."
Orisae tells you, "I have some pots and pans, dearest. Would you like me to clank them together for you to grant you a touch of clarity?"
Orisae tells you, "Are you able to speak and see?"
You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Can see... not... s-s-speak. Someone carrying me... can't feel snow."
Orisae tells you, "Lin. Are you freezing to death?"
You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Ha... ha, ha... no, no, not anymore, b-beloved..."
"Just be still," Kiyotan gently but firmly instructs as he backpedals away from the melted burrow. Holding you steadily, he traispes in a direction that, to you, must appear to have been chosen at random. That is, until the gaps between the snow begin to brighten and the wind begins to recede.
Orisae tells you, "Tch... Lin, where are you? You are not a creature of snow and ice! Tell me where you are. Who carries you?"
You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Somewhere flat and grey... c-c-carried by... Samrata, emperor... n-named Kiyotan... peace, sshhhavora... everything is good."
Orisae tells you, "You are insufferable and lost."
The center of an infinite crossroads. (The Havens.) (20132)
Amid an endless field of green grass, a crossroads of beaten earth divides, each leg stretching off into an unchanging horizon, static scenery as far as the eye can see. The dirt paths are razor-straight and wide enough for ten men to walk shoulder-to-shoulder. Overhead, the sky is a perpetual grey haze, forever casting these fields in wan, pale light. Standing out in stark foreignness, the very center of the crossroads's joint bears a small raised dais of white marble, upon which stands a golden throne. Wrought with elegant and meticulous care and draped with luxurious velvet, this seat bears an alien beauty, exquisite but for its bizarre and alien presence in an otherwise empty field. Kiyotan is here.
Exits: north, east, south, and west.
You have emoted: Lin's flesh is so cold it almost burns. She lies limp in Kiyotan's arms, but her fingers and toes are trapped in a stiffened curl. She shows signs of immediate recovery, but babbles like an infant, her eyes darting everywhere.
Orisae tells you, in Harpy, "..are you at least moving?"
Kiyotan's trek is kept at a moderate pace; purposeful without being hasty. The empty white soon adopts the color of the cloudless sky, followed thereafter by the grass framing the road. Before long, the familiar sound of dirt beneath his feet concludes the transition back to the vast plain. He meets the crossroad from the eastern spur and continues straight westward, walking towards that featureless nothing until, once again, everything fades to white.
You just received message #5832 from Kiyotan.
Message #5832 Sent By: Kiyotan Received On: 2/20/2012/2:54
"(Tempted to lick lin and see if tongue sticks)."
You sent the following message to Kiyotan:
(( eeeeeewwwwwwww ))
You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "I am... oh, oh... so much warmer now. Gods... must have been... asleep... ages. Oh, so warm."
Orisae tells you, in Harpy, "Can you describe your surroundings, love?"
You follow Kiyotan to the west.
Vast cavern beneath an active volcano. (The Havens.) (20749)
A palpable heat permeates the cavern, the warmth just shy of uncomfortable, humidity and the faint scent of sulphur carried with it. The ground underfoot, above and around is made of smooth, level black rock, and though navigating the cavern is made somewhat treacherous by the stalagmites and stalactites that bite up from above and below, other stone formations have created natural shelves and striated slopes, appearing comparatively comfortable. A few steam vents rise up from the ground, spewing heated, billowing clouds of gas that hangs in the air and obscures the farther reaches of the cavern in its grayish cloud. Here and there cracks have developed in the rock from mounted pressure beneath, rivulets of lava making jagged seams throughout the cavern, the ominous red-orange glow illuminating the grotto. Kiyotan is here.
Exits: east.
You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Just a cave... very long, very dark cave. Don't remember being carried here, must... must be because I am frozen... he moves sometimes, dodges stalactites."
Orisae tells you, "Kiyotan?"
You tell Lady Provost Orisae Adesso, "Yes."
Orisae tells you, "Well, at least you have someone where you are, Shavora. You are in a place, as usual, where I cannot go."
You have emoted: Lin makes a dry croaking noise, and then, in the first patch of Aetolian she has spoken since Kiyotan found her, she asks, "Throat... hurts... water?" Her breathing has quickened, her pulse recovering, as quickly and dramatically as an Albedi engine warming up.
The smell of sulphur is the first to permeate the voidspace, followed by a suffusing heat so thick, it's almost tangible. Despite this, like before, Kiyotan seems untouched by the temperature. He navigates the craggy cavern with the ease of familiarity until he comes to a shelf of rock in a curious chair shape. It's across this that he carefully drapes your body, head propped up on one 'arm,' legs draped over the other. The stone itself is comfortingly warm, and the molten rock glowing in cracks amid the cavern walls provide an encompassing, relaxing heat. He straightens up and looks down at you, arms at his sides, schooling the look of concern into an expression of expectation. At your request, he presents a cup.
Kiyotan gives a delicate, hand-painted cup to you.
You are holding:
"cup237125" a delicate, hand-painted cup (hot hazelnut and vanilla kawhe).
You have emoted: Lin bends her fingers with what looks to be supreme effort around the curve of the cup. She merely lifts it to her lips, inhaling the vapors of the beverage, a little confused at the smell but too eager to care. After warming her face on its steam, she slowly tries to upend the cup into her mouth, drinking greedily of the kawhe, which dribbles and spills down her face and body.
Cupping your hands around a delicate, hand-painted cup of steaming hazelnul and vanilla kawhe, you bring it up to your lips and take a slow sip, the rich flavors pleasing to the taste and the delicious aroma wafting off the surface into your face. Proving to be good for any cold day, the kawhe leaves you feeling warm from head to toe.
"Hey, hey," Kiyotan chides, reaching forward to tilt the cup backwards to moderate your intake, lest you choke. With a healer's trained eye, he continues to quietly monitor your hypothermic recovery. "You looked cozy," he finally murmurs through a small, lopsided smirk.
You have emoted: Lin lowers the cup to gasp for breath, moisture running down the sides of her face. She turns ever so slightly, her face smushed up against the arm of the chairlike stone, gazing into space with that distant expression. "Tried to... keep walking, at first... thought I would walk for a whole month. Then... everything got complicated." Her brow knits as she frowns thoughtfully.
You have emoted: Suddenly, Lin gives in to a violent shiver, curling tightly in her seat, her arms wrapping tightly around her. She moans loudly, her voice edged with pain.
Kiyotan's eyebrows furrow, concern making cracks in his indifferent mask. "I thought you monks were supposed to embody discipline," he remarks softly, nudging your legs to make room for himself to sit on the shelf of stone opposite your head. At the sudden shiver, he jolts in surprise, reaching his bare left hand out to your forehead. "What is it?" he asks, failing to completely mask his worry behind sarcasm. "Have you taken ill?"
You have emoted: Lin is motionless, locked into her fetal curl. Her forehead blazes beneath Kiyotan's hand, in stark contrast to the chill that still lingers beneath the rest of her flesh. She breathes loudly in slow-paced gasps, whispering, "Trying to... trying to see... trying to... large, all so large..."
A look of gravity flashes across Kiyotan's face before he withdraws his hand. "Yes, it's something I hear often," he distractedly remarks, reaching to squeeze your shoulder. Immediately upon contact, you can feel a blanket of protection drape upon you, like a phantom shroud. The Yeleni then murmurs incomprehensibly sussurating words, and a 'circle' of light glows in the rock beneath you, the shape of the stone warping the luminescent ring. Its interior suddenly fills with a dizzying latticework of light, the rejuvenation aura invoked.
You have emoted: Lin falls silent for a long time, light playing over skin that acquires its healthy brown tone. She keeps the cup cradled loosely in her hands at an angle, the kawhe on the verge of spilling, but never making the edge. Over time, she sounds off intermittently - first, more of 'large' things, but they seem to become smaller, easier to grasp and encompass. Then, in the Fae tongue, "Claws... so angry... beat the walls, beat the walls... choking me..." But this too passes, and when she next opens her eyes, they are full of life, a clarity of focus present, her line of sight sharp. She sits up, slowly, surprised to find Kiyotan so close.
You have emoted: "Was it just a month...?" Lin asks.
The sag of Kiyotan's shoulders betrays his relief. "Maybe a day or two less," he muses softly, sucking his lower lip into his mouth. Again, he reaches a hand out to touch your forehead. "How do you feel?"
You have emoted: At Kiyotan's contact, Lin's eyelids drop. A fluttery breath escapes her lips. "Ver- very... very quiet, inside. Want to leave here, so much that I know but can't think..." Her arms wind tightly around her chest, and she leans gently into Kiyotan's hand.
Kiyotan's mouth curves into a frown. "I am sorry," he says under his breath. "This was..not supposed to be about survival." Reluctantly, he withdraws his hand from your forehead. "We can go if you think you can stand."
You have emoted: Lin does seem to think so, but fails on the first try, heaving up from the chair and teetering on untrustworthy legs. Falling unceremoniously back into her seat, she pauses, sips a breath, braces herself, and tries again, this time standing as if there were no difficulty in the first place, though her posture droops. "Could survive," she says quietly, her voice impossibly hoarse. "If it was only snow..."
Kiyotan turns his head to favor you with a side-eyed look of suspicion. "What else was there?" he carefully queries.
You have emoted: Lin only shakes her head, pointing at her throat. She heaves her cloak up from the seat and tugs it over her shoulders like a blanket, though the heavy fur is damp with melted ice. Staring off into the distance, she appears to be looking for an exit, her head darting about hastily as one fails to present itself.
Kiyotan takes his cue and flows from the chair to a standing position. He hesitates for a moment, looking thoughtfully at you. Whatever he was debated, though, he appears to have decided against, and simply turns, heading further into the heat of the volcano, gesturing for you to follow.
You have emoted: Lin is slow on her feet, plodding after Kiyotan in the dark. She hunches like a crone beneath her covering, wordless and shaken.
--> --> -->
Back in the center of the paths' convergence, Kiyotan finally halts, turning to watch you make up the ground between you. When you draw near, he holds his hand out to you. "The Pride welcomes you back, Sentinel. Redeemed."
You have emoted: Lin stares at Kiyotan for a long time, just taking a moment to make a connection in his eyes, as if trying to remember how to establish contact. Then, her eyes drop down to his hand, and after another long pause, she reaches out and extends a palm, sliding it a ways past his hand to grasp his wrist instead. Her strength is renewed, her grip tight, and a smile works its way across her face, weak but sincere. "Thank you," she whispers.
Kiyotan nods his head conclusively, and sweeps his free hand across his body, sending the world around you to spinning, the colors becoming a blurry morass, losing shape and meaning.
You follow Kiyotan to the ether.
The broad porch of a small bungalow.
A small set of stairs separates the bungalow from the jungle garden. Raised several feet from the ground, this wide wooden porch offers a broad view of the eastern Itzatl. With exotic gardens and rainforest surrounding, there is a riot of color in every direction. The porch itself is simplistic, sparsely furnished with only a few stools and a cozy swing, and protected from the jungle showers beneath a wide overhang from which dangle a variety of vines. The smell of fresh earth mingles with the scent of sawdust from the bungalow's wooden frame, an aromatic hint of the rainforest's more exotic flora teasing the senses. Looking onto the porch are twin circular glass-paneled windows, separated in the middle by a door of the same plain wood that comprises the rest of the secluded residence. A hammock-swing occupies the space here, invitingly. The warrior-priestess Klaana stands here. Kiyotan is here.
Exits: east and west (closed pine door).
You have emoted: Lin's eyes widen at her surroundings, the house unfamiliar to her. Her tail stops and lies still on the ground as she looks to Kiyotan with confusion. "Where are we?"
Kiyotan releases your hand and casually drops into the hammock-swing a pace away. "A safe place," he responds through a genial smile. "We are on the outskirts of Saluria."
You have emoted: "Oh," Lin says simply, glancing about with concern. "I have preyed often on these people..." Her demeanor changes, now that she is back in the real world, her posture lower to the ground, her legs bunched tight with muscle that remembers how to move and shift. She looks, as ever, ready to spring away at high speeds, but instead of leaving, or qualifying her non-sequitur, she kneels before Kiyotan in the seat and throws an arm over him, resting her head on his chest.
Kiyotan freezes in surprise when you knelt at his feet, "Wha--" all he manages before you sprawl upon him. Bewilderment conquers his demeanor as he looks down at you, but gradually loses its grasp. With reluctance, he drapes his arms around your shoulders, his chin atop your head. And finally, his eye closes, and the Yeleni surrenders.
You have emoted: Lin murmurs nonsense into Kiyotan's chest, her hands trembling. Brimming with emotion, she nudges her head into the curve of Kiyotan's throat, eager to continue grasping on for just a little while - the first contact she's had in a whole month. When she pulls away, at last, she curls her arms tightly around her body, smiling worriedly. "Glad to be back," she says. "Tha- thank you."
At a loss for anything meaningful to say, Kiyotan can only nod his head once in acknowledgement. When you shift away, his arms drop limply into his lap, and he looks a little bit dazed.
You have emoted: Lin does dart away this time, but it is only her nature. As she left, she looked most encouraged - hopeful, even.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
