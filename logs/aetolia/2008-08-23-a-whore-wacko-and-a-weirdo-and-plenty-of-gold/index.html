(Bloodloch.)
Hafydus the minotaur barkeep stands with meaty arms crossed over his broad chest. A beautifully carved chess board is attached firmly to a heavy stand here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A retired soldier from the Bloodloch army sits here, drunk. A grotesque Nazetu guard stands here, fingering a huge mace threateningly. A small leather sack has been left on the ground. There are 11 opaque shot glasses here. There are 2 fancy glasses here. Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus is here. Jawan Racheim Ve&#39;kahi, Childe of Avaesse is here. He wields a short-necked lute in his left hand. Sitara Nebre&#39;seir is here. She wields a gruesome crescent scythe in her hands. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see a single exit leading south.


Jawan Racheim Ve&#39;kahi, Childe of Avaesse smiles encouraging at Xavin, his gaze a little dimmed by the unaccustomed consumption of alcohol. "That&#39;s right... it&#39;ll help! A tumble or a romp or whatever you like to call it, it always makes a fellow feel better!"

You have emoted: Leoja staggers into the room, quickly ending up slamming into the bar and holding on to it to keep her balance, before ordering a camilla in a groggy voice.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir blinks owlishly and scrambles to the side, giving you enough room to stumble around. "Oh my..." she says softly. "Soooooomeone&#39;s been into the Absinthe!"

Sitara giggles happily.

Racheim claps his hands together decisively. "Well! I have to be going."

You have emoted: Leoja stares over at Xavin for a few moments, before bursting out in laughter and raising her glass up high. "Of course I am, dearie." she sweetly croaks out with her hoarse voice, before gulping some of the drink down.

Xavin seems to think for a moment before nodding slowly at Racheim.

You drain the last drops of bloody camilla from the glass.

Xavin grins mischievously at you.

Sitara stares at Leoja, even ash she leans back even further and wraps her arms around Xavin, as if for protection.

Racheim is enveloped in translucent fire for a moment and is gone, his soul safe until he returns to Aetolia.

Sitara stares at you and blinks.

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

You have emoted: Leoja tilts her head slightly, her gills flapping slightly as she studies Sitara. "Absinthe is vile and only for petty sluts." she announces in a loud voice, slamming her glass down on the bar.

Sitara gasps in shock, her hands flying to her mouth, even as her gaze hardens. "You wouldn&#39;t dare insult King Absinthe like that!" she screams, hopping off her barstool. "Absinthe is the drink of royalty! Like Sitara!"

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "And anyway, she has no room to call anyone a petty slut. SHE is not even clothed, much to brother&#39;s dismay!"

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to Xavin, "Isn&#39;t that right brother? The sight of naked girl-flesh just turns your stomach, doesn&#39;t it?"

Xavin brushes a hand through his mane, a wide grin drawing across his face. "I wouldn&#39;t go that far, dear Sitara."

You have emoted: Leoja rolls her eyes, leaning over the bar towards a bottle of Camille and refilling her glass. "Absinthe is vile." she mutters as she turns around, dragging her cleavage off the bar to get into a somewhat more dignifying position as she proudly straightens herself towards Sitara. "And I am infinitely more a woman than you." she muses, her voice finding some of its smoothness back after the drink.

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

You have emoted: Leoja peers at Xavin, "What? Can&#39;t you make a woman feels proud of her body and state your admiration out loud?" she says, slamming her glass back down as she leans back against the bar.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir blinks at you in shocked silence, for perhaps the first time in her life completely unsure of what to say. Finally she crosses her arms over her chest and huffs, stamping her boot like a child. "Hmph! Height has nothing to do with anything!" she states, matter-of-factly, standing on her tip-toes as best as her boots will allow.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus looks you over hungrily for a moment. "Such things need not be said, miss...?", he says softly.

Sitara whirls and glares at Xavin. "BroTHER!"

You have emoted: Leoja offers Xavin a little smile as her fingers run over the well-rounded flesh of her left breast, circling the nipple before tenderly flicking it a moment, her gills flapping intently for a moment or two as that happens. "It is not about height, dearie, it is about fullness. About quality. About tenderness." The former words were aimed at Sitara, but the latter are obviously moreso directed at Xavin.

Your need for sustenance is becoming serious. You must find food soon or you will begin to suffer harm.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir turns back around, opening her mouth to say something in return, but only stops and stares at your hand as it works it&#39;s way over you body. "Oh my..." is the only thing she can manage.

Sitara murmurs something softly to Xavin.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus&#39;s eyes rake across Leoja&#39;s form as his tongue darts out to lick his lips. Turning to Sitara, he leans close to whisper something in her ear.

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

You have emoted: Leoja smiles widely as she pushes herself away from the bar, daintily walking her way towards the two, allowing her rack to bounce with every step. Her eyes remain in contact with Xavin, amusement and wickedness alight in them. She takes his hand, not saying a word.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir squeaks and steps back, watching the interaction with a hint of dismay. "Hey!" she screams. "You can&#39;t just..." her voice trails off, as she has no idea what to say, and still her eyes are focused on your chest.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir mutters, "Bitch..."

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus&#39;s eyes widen as you takes his hand, his eyes clearly focused on her naked flesh. As he watches her, his tail begins to sway lazily behind him.

With a slightly desperate look in her eyes, Sitara glances around the room for a solution. Finally downing her last shot of tequila, she throws the glass to the corner and reaches behind her back, tugging at the bow that holds her corset to her body. She takes a deep breath, pushing the corset outward, and then letting it fall away to expose her full breasts, her nipples immediately hardening in the cool air.

Sitara removes a black satin and lace corset.

You have emoted: Leoja gently guides the hand to rest on the breast she played with moments ago, her eyes focused on the man in front of her and ignoring the pesky little human vampiress. "How does that feel? Mighty, does it not?" she coos softly, pressing herself closer against the man. "It could all be yours for a modest reimbursement." she sweetly adds, grinning slightly at Sitara when noticing the admiration. "That goes for you too, dearie." she adds, her eyes back at Xavin already.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus softly squeezes the breast beneath his hand, his claws resting lightly against the flesh. As Sitara removes her corset he stops and stares at her for a long moment.

Sitara tells you, "(Hold on, I&#39;ve got one coming...)"

[2266] [2713] [eb] 17:46.141 -

You tell Sitara Nebre&#39;seir, "((Ok, I&#39;ll wait for your emote.))"

[2266] [2713] [eb] 17:56.366 -

You tell Sitara Nebre&#39;seir, "((To hell with that, you&#39;re taking too long.))"

You have emoted: Leoja giggles lightly as she gently rubs herself against Xavin, wrapping her arms around him before tilting her head to look at Sitara. "Ooh, so you&#39;ve got a rack. Very well done, dear. Sadly, just a rack won&#39;t make you a woman." she says, winking slightly at Xavin.

Sitara squeals in protest, then scurries up to Xavin and takes his free hand, placing it upon her breast. She takes a breath, pushing the soft, willing flesh into his palm, and even manages a little moan as her nipple brushes against his fingers. She grins smugly and looks over at Leoja. "Ball&#39;s in your court, bitch."

You have emoted: Leoja laughs softly at Sitara. "Fine, I take it you&#39;ll be paying me, then." With those words, she leans close to Xavin, pressing her nose against his, allowing her lips to momentarily friction over his, before drawing him closer into a seductive, lingering kiss that last several seconds.

Silvie arrives from the south.

Silvie gives a shoddy tartan scarf to Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus.

Silvie gives a stack of 15 red inks to Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus.

Silvie nods her head at herself.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says, "Silvie...Thank you. I&#39;ll open it later, ok? Now&#39;s not a good time."

Silvie nods her head emphatically.

You murmur to Xavin, "You&#39;ve got a lovely child, to see her willing to pay for your pleasures like this."

Silvie utters several words under her breath.
Slick blood in its wake, a flesh golem enters from the ether.

Silvie utters a word of command to her golem.
With a powerful shove, a flesh golem pushes Silvie south.
Silvie leaves to the ether.

Xavin murmurs to you, "She&#39;s not my childe...she&#39;s the childe of my sire."

Slick blood in its wake, a flesh golem stumbles out to the ether.

You murmur to Xavin, "Still, she&#39;s a darling, offering to pay like that. She must like you a lot."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir shrieks and pushes her hand in front of your face, trying to break up the unheard conversation. "Silly unclothed whore!" She screams, reaching up and grabbing your wrists in her hands. she pushes her backwards, still holding her in a firm grip. "You don&#39;t get to touch him unless I say!"

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus swallows hard as his eyes shift between the two of you, almost as he can&#39;t quite decide who to look at more. At Sitara&#39;s outburst his jaw drops and he shakes his head. "Dear one...calm. Please?"

Your legs begin to tremble with weakness and you feel light-headed and dizzy. The thought of food looms foremost in your mind.

You have emoted: Leoja is easily pushed away, and she grins slightly. "Sure, Miss. I&#39;d like to be paid up front from here on, though." she sweetly says, her gills softly flapping as her eyes seek out Xavin&#39;s. "I have my expenses."

Nahira ignores everyone but the minotaur as she walks directly towards him, slamming a handful of coins on the bar.

Nahira buys an opaque shot glass with tequila.

Sitara throws her head over her shoulder and hisses grandly at Xavin, only giving him a second&#39;s attention before turning back to Leoja. "Can she pay you to put some CLOTHING on, silly whore? And perhaps suck some poison and die screaming? Yes? Brother is off-limits! He&#39;s FRAGILE!"

Your mental equilibrium is disturbed by overpowering thoughts of food.


Your legs collapse from under you and consciousness leaves you as you pass out from extreme hunger.

You regain consciousness with a start.

You double over in pain as your stomach virtually collapses.

Sitara blinks.

Nahira shoves the empty shot glass moodily back across the bar, gesturing for a refill with one hand as she slides some more coins from her back and onto the bar with her other.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir nudges you with one foot.

Xavin takes a deep breath, shaking his head. "Well...that&#39;s..."

You have emoted: Leoja smiles somewhat, reassuredly stepping towards Sitara. "Yes you can pay me for all that, Miss." she sweetly says, before leaning closer to her and placing her hands on her shoulders. "I am just trying to make a li.." she says, before her feet collapse beneath her and she ungracefully sails towards the floor.

Xavin leaves to the south.

You see Sitara Nebre&#39;seir yell, "Brother! Get her some food!"

Xavin arrives from the south.

Xavin gives 6 rabbits to you.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says, "Eat something, would you? Looks painful."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir stares down at you, and again nudges you with her foot. "Garn then, silly girl. Eat up."

You have emoted: Leoja looks up weakly, and smiles momentarily before eagerly ripping a limb off the rabbit, and stuffing it in her mouth.

You quickly devour a skewer of rabbit meat.

Nahira sips on her refilled glass a bit more slowly this time, glancing idly around the bar as she works on the clear liquid within it.

You quickly devour a skewer of rabbit meat.

Sitara stares implacably at you.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "What is your name, silly naked whore."

You have emoted: With the blood seeping over her lips and towards her chin Leoja shakes her head. "Lady of comfort. Confidante. Not -whore-." she stresses, the back of her hand running over her chin to wipe the blood away some. "Leoja Annay."

Jin&#39;s eyes gleam with generosity.

Jin gives a dusky, twilit sapphire dress to you.

Jin rubs his hands together greedily.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir sniffs and nudges you with her foot once more. "Mother calls us "Hares in mating season." yes.

Nahira takes a long swallow that finishes the tequila in her glass before setting the glass back on the bar. Pushing herself off the stool where she&#39;d perched, she moves towards the door again, tossing her hair over her shoulders as she goes.

Nahira leaves to the south.

You have emoted: Leoja drops her head in her neck, momentarily glancing at the stranger who tossed the dress towards her before glancing back at Sitara. "Maybe you. I&#39;m more of a chittering bird offering shelter in winter." she says softly, again eagerly biting down on the remainders of her rabbit.

Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir stares down at you with her hands on her hips, her chest heaving in a mixture of anger and bitter amusement. "She is as mad as Sitara, yesss...well. Come up little whore. Or ah...Lady of co...lady of com...slut! Let us get you some clothing, yes? You will freeze!"

Dusky and deep as the starless firmament at twilight, rich azure colors hue this dress, the silky folds dyed masterfully to emulate the span of the sky between day and night. Inky indigo, lustering on jet black, frames the face and decolletage, accented by carved sapphire gems, crafted to emulate roses frozen in a glassy bloom. Tightly tracing the contours of the body, the dress wraps around the torso, the material blushing lighter, seamlessly, into a dark, shadowed blend of navy and violet. Curving around the hips and trailing downwards in a satiny fall of dwindling chroma, the garment ends at the feet in a melting wash of blue, the cerulean pure and deep.
It has 57 months of usefulness left.
It weighs about 3 pounds and 0 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Moirean Seirath, Huntress of the Wilds.

Jin says, "She already has a rather nice dress, I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll freeze."

Jin says, "Suffer from drafts, maybe, but not freeze."

Sitara snorts and points to the girl&#39;s naked breasts, and her prominent, hardened nipples. "Look at her!" she huffs. "She&#39;ll put someone&#39;s eye out with those things! She needs a bra, yes?"

You have emoted: Leoja holds the dress Jin offered her up for display. "I will hardly die." she mutters as she heaves herself from the floor, slightly unsteady in her legs for the first few moments.

Jin says, "I could think of worse ways to lose an eye."

Xavin grins mischievously at Jin.

Jin says, "Like you waving that scythe around."

Jin says, "Nipples over iron, I say."

Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir snorts and stamps her boot, but says nothing, instead folding her arms over her bare chest once again. She glares at you, and again her eyes stray downward. "Silly whore..." she mutters.

You have emoted: Leoja nods at Jin and sweetly says, "Thank you for the dress. I think the little Lady is just feeling a bit threatened. I can imagine she gets little competition in looks."

You are now wearing a dusky, twilit sapphire dress.

Jin says, "Oh, did I walk in on a territory fight? I suppose I should stay out of it."

You have emoted: After putting the dress on Leoja glances towards Sitara. "Is this a bit better for you, Miss? I owe you for the rabbit, I believe."

Sitara re-ties her corset, cinching the cords a little tighter than normal so that her hips and cleavage are more prominent than before.

Sitara puts on a black satin and lace corset.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus shrugs at you and says, "Common decency. Besides, rabbit isn&#39;t exactly expensive, you know?"

Jin scratches at his cheek, "Man, doesn&#39;t that just beat all. I walk in on the oddest things."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Nay, nay she says...twas brother&#39;s money..."

Jin swirls his flagon around a bit, "Maybe I need something stronger." he muses to himself.

Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.

Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.

You have emoted: Leoja smiles faintly, and nods towards Xavin in gratitude. "But it was.. your particular voice I heard shrieking to get me food." she offers in weak defense towards Sitara, obviously trying to diffuse the hostilities from earlier.

Sitara chews thoughtfully on her lip.

Sitara snorts and flips her hair out of her eyes with a little flourish. "I only wanted to get you food so I could kill you properly. But now you&#39;re all...dressed."

Jin says, "Quite a nice dress, if I do say so myself."

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.

Xavin winks knowingly at Sitara.

Sitara blinks.

You say to Sitara, "Certainly, one as distinguished and special as yourself doesn&#39;t hold grudges or a jealousy to a woman making a living. Do you?"

Jin raises an eyebrow just a little.

Jin says, "I must be missing some key part to this."

Sitara blinks owlishly, completely disarmed for a moment. She then straightens up to her full, unimpressive height, and shakes her head. "Oh no...I suppose not. Princess Sitara is a kind and gentle noble, after all. But...but really. Must you be so...you know...blatant? Even Sitara, who fucks like a wild animal in the middle of the street if the mood suits her, would not be so bold."

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says to Jin, "Aye..."

Jin chokes on his mead a bit, then chuckles, "..I don&#39;t know what could be much more blatant than fucking like a wild animal in the streets, but I daresay it&#39;d be something akin to rape."

Sitara gives a feral grin and nods vigorously.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Though...the men Sitara takes to bed never call it rape in the end...no no..."

Sitara giggles happily.

Jin says to you, "Are you a rapist, little lady?"

Sitara tilts her head curiously at you.

The corners of Xavin&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

You have emoted: Leoja giggles lightly, and tilts her head slightly as the gillflapping accompanies it. "Most people who have something to sell, are quite obvious about it. How else will they get customers? If it were a private matter, I&#39;m surely not appalled to closing the door behind me." she says, fluttering her eyelashes at Sitara. "Honestly, I meant no offense to you.... princess?" The last word comes out more as a question to the sanity of the title than a question of accepting the apology made.

You smile and say to Jin, "Only when I&#39;ve been paid up handsomely in front for the act, sir."

Jin hits his left hand into the palm of his right, "Ahah, she&#39;s a whore. I see, so that wasn&#39;t just being insulting. So does that mean you both are?" he asks curiously, looking from one to the other, then shrugs a bit and takes another pull on his flagon.

Xavin bites his lip, a wide grin on his face. "Careful there...I doubt either of them appreciate being called a whore."

You say to Jin, "Lady of comforts would be my choice of words."

Jin says, "Hey, you dont call a bartender a &#39;liquid refreshment dispenser&#39; nor a killer a &#39;people handling service&#39;."

Jin says, "Is what it is."

"Hmph!" Sitara proclaims. "She is not a whore!" She turns to you and grins widely, placing her hands on her hips. "She is Sitara Nebre&#39;seir, Princess of the Stars! She is ruler of all she surveys, and that includes, at the moment, this bar!"

Sitara nods her head affirmatively.

You say to Jin, "Well, probably because they also prepare meals, and offer protection to others in the second case. It&#39;s a matter of looking at the whole package, compared to just a simple fuck."

Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "Oh, you&#39;re being too modest, dear girl...far too modest. There is no such thing as a simple fuck..."

Jin says to Sitara, "You look like a little kid, honestly."

Jin shrugs helplessly.

Jin drains the last dregs of smooth honey mead from a flagon.

Sitara snorts arrogantly.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to Jin, "That&#39;s because you&#39;re not looking with the right eyes!"

Jin says to Sitara, "You mean I haven&#39;t had enough to drink? Yes, I believe I said something akin to that earlier."

You say to Sitara, "A fuck just pleases the body, &#39;Princess&#39;. A good lady of comforts eases and consoles the mind first."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "Oh tch...eases and consoles the mind...rubbish, rubbish! What could be more consoling than wallowing in the depravity of your own orgasm..."

Jin says, "Sounds like the makings of a contest. I&#39;ll do my duty and take on the onerous position of judge."

Jin snickers under his breath.

Xavin peers at Jin suspiciously.

You say to Sitara, "I don&#39;t know... actually considering yourself to be a person, rather than talking about yourself with the third person and using the title of princess?"

Sitara opens her mouth to say something more, but has seemingly caught herself off guard. Instead she simply stares off into space, a slight flush rising to her cheeks. She clears her throat and folds her hands behind her back once more.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "Let me ask, pretty thing...does she enjoy what she does?"

You say to Sitara, "I love my work. I&#39;d not do it otherwise."

Sitara creases her brow in a frown.

Sitara purses her lips, deep in thought.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "...and...you get PAYED..."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "To...fuck?"

Jin says, "And just how much do you get paid? Now that we&#39;re on the subject."

You have emoted: Leoja allows her gills to flap twice, and she shakes her head. "To be a Lady of Comforts. The pay determines the amount of comfort extended."

Xavin ponders the situation.

Jin says, "Sounds dubious. I like my wares to be a bit more cut and dry when it comes to my purse."

Jin nods his head sagely.

You say to Jin, "That depends on the services required. I am not cheap, though. My customers do not want a used body of flesh, they want a Lady. You can&#39;t get a lady without paying the proper amount of respect."

Jin says to you, "If by respect, you mean gold, then fair enough."

You say to Jin, "Gold and manners. I merely take one client at a time, however."

Xavin ponders the situation.

Jin says to you, "No group therapy?"

Jin snickers under his breath.

Sitara , who has been watching the exchange silently for some time, suddenly raises her hand happily. "Not her! No no! She takes two and three at a time, if the price is right!"

Sitara blinks.

Sitara grins sheepishly.

Xavin murmurs to you, "When you say that you aren&#39;t cheap...what price range do you mean?"

You have emoted: Leoja is confused for a moment, before the use of Sitara&#39;s third person dawns on her. "I am sure your standards aren&#39;t as high as mine, no." she kindly replies.

Sitara&#39;s breath catches in a gasp of surprise.

Jin coughs a bit, stifling a chuckle as he then takes another quick sip of his flagon.

Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Standards? You&#39;re...you&#39;re getting payed to let someone stick their junk in your hooha! What standards?!?"

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "And where&#39;s the blood FUN IN STANDARDS?"

You murmur to Xavin, "Oh, it honestly depends on the amount of services you require. Just the flesh, or also a smart girl to challenge your mind? Someone to flaunt with in public?"

Jin&#39;s eyes gleam with generosity.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Ahem. Bloody, that is."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Eheh."

Jin gives 500 gold sovereigns to you.

Jin rubs his hands together greedily.

Jin says, "That was worth that."

You smile at Jin.

You smile and say to Jin, "I&#39;m glad you find a simple conversation this entertaining, sir."

Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.

Jin says to you, "I&#39;m a simple creature."

Sitara murmurs something softly to Jin.

Xavin murmurs to you, "The flesh and intelligent conversation...I&#39;d like my mind to be taken off things for a while."

Sitara murmurs something softly to Jin.

You say to Sitara, "Oh, don&#39;t tell me you have never been tempted to call yourself a Lady. A princess is a nice title, but it means nothing. A man wants a woman that reaches up to his stature, someone who can be as radiant as he is strong, and not look diminutive in comparison."

Jin says to Sitara, "Looks like she already has an interested party, anyway, and she did say she only takes single clients."

Jin snickers under his breath.

Sitara mutters discontentedly.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir exclaims to Jin, "BROTHER IS NOT AN INTERESTED CLIENT!"

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "Lady Lady Lady...titles are irrelevant. Our drunken friend here..."

Sitara pokes at Jin pointedly.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Has a point."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Why call yourself a lady? Euphemisms are just little lies."

You have emoted: Leoja smiles at Xavin, before flirtatiously running her hand over his cheek. "That could be arranged." she muses before she turns back to Sitara. "And no, I am sure he isn&#39;t, Miss."

Sitara blinks.

Sitara glares angrily at Xavin.

Sitara murmurs something softly to Xavin.

Jin slaps his knee, laughing again, unable to stifle it this time as he throws his head back and laughs loudly.

Jin says, "Oh gods."

Jin&#39;s eyes gleam with generosity.

Jin gives 500 gold sovereigns to you.

Jin rubs his hands together greedily.

Your eyes sparkle with amusement as you gaze upon Jin.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus brushes a hand through his mane, smiling innocently at Sitara. "The specifics of it don&#39;t matter much, dear one."

Sitara shrieks in frustration.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to Xavin, "Tell me or I&#39;ll rip your cock off of your body and strangle you with it!"

Xavin purses his lips pensively, gazing thoughtfully at some distant point.

You have emoted: Leoja pulls her hand away from Xavin, and walks to Sitara. "I don&#39;t mean to offend you though, Miss. It is merely my job." she says, smiling lightly as she leans closer to the &#39;princess&#39;.

Calmly, Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says to Sitara, "Why would you do that, dear one? I&#39;d say it would serve you better to leave it attached, hrm?"

You murmur to Sitara, "You could just take my services, you know. Pay me handsomely, and I won&#39;t take another client. I take it you understand my meaning of confidentiality, so I can&#39;t confirm or deny anything... but you might just enjoy my services."

Jin says to you, "Ahh, my my. Well, if you&#39;re ever without custom and in need of work, do look me up."

Sitara opens her mouth and hisses warningly, though even as she does so her eyes flick over to Xavin, her own gaze becoming confused. She leans back as Leoja leans forward, raising her scythe as if to ward her away somehow. "You...evil seductress thing! Trying to take brother away!"

You have emoted: Leoja turns around fluently, allowing the dress to sweep around her in a medium-wide arc. "I will, thank you dear Sir. I am usually around these parts when I&#39;m unemployed anyhow." she says.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to Xavin, "Would it make him feel better if she asked for payment? five thousand gold for a roll in the hay with her, yes!"

Jin says, "Good, good, maybe I can send you off harpy slaying for personal amusement."

Sitara flutters her eyelashes at Xavin.

You have emoted: Leoja blinks her eyes widely, shaking her head. "You get me wrong, Miss. My clients confidentiality is their own. If your brother hired me, I would not allow myself to tell anyone without his consent."

Xavin raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.

Jin says to you, "Busy currently, I take it?"

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Sitara murmurs something softly to Xavin.

Sitara glares angrily at Xavin.

Xavin purses his lips pensively, gazing thoughtfully at some distant point.

You say, "A Lady of Comforts is very strict with the confidentiality of those she has given services to - it can sometimes reflect wrongly on the clients in question. So I am afraid any accusations are merely the product of your own unwishful thinking."

You say to Jin, "I probably am, yes."

Jin says, "Shame, shame."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir stares at you, completely confused by the jumble of words.

Sitara ceases to wield a gruesome crescent scythe, securing it to her weaponbelt.

You tell Jin, "The princess amuses me to no end right now, I am afraid."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "...hmph..."

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Jin tells you, "Oh, I wouldn&#39;t dream of dragging anyone away from this, its more amusement than I&#39;ve had in years of staged entertainment."

You have emoted: Leoja smiles kindly at Xavin again before shrugging at Sitara. "Well, just remember what I told you, Miss. It is merely my job."

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus flashes you a charming smile before dropping a few coins on the bar.

Xavin buys a blackened glass with red wine.

Xavin blinks.

Xavin takes a long draught of red wine.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir mutters something under her breath and leans forward, giving you a little sniff. She crouches, circling around you in a defensive position, as if sizing her up. Finally she comes back around to the front and stands up straight once more.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "How much."

You have emoted: Leoja smiles sweetly at Xavin before walking to him, and slipping her arm under his while the small one is circling her. "Make me an offer." she replies coyly, both to the girl and the man whoms arm she has pinched beneath hers.


Sitara huffs in exasperation. "t...two thousand!"

Sitara glares angrily at some gold sovereigns.

You have emoted: Leoja laughs softly, shaking her head. "Dear, dear. I&#39;m not talking for a short term. I&#39;m talking for a prolonged period. You should add another zero at the least."

Sitara blinks.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "...pro..."

Sitara chews thoughtfully on her lip.

Softly, Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says, "That sounds agreeable...how long would that cover?"

You say to Xavin, "You know. Like meals together in the evening. Walks in the moonlight. Galas. Whatever kind of services you&#39;d require."

Sitara shouts "Oi!" at the top of her voice.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Twenty-five thousand, damnit!"

You say to Xavin, "That would cover basic company for a year. Specific services would mean the price goes up, naturally."

You smile at Sitara.

Xavin purses his lips pensively, gazing thoughtfully at some distant point.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says, "I&#39;ll call it thirty thousand."

Sitara stares implacably at some gold sovereigns.

Xavin ponders some gold sovereigns&#39;s profile, deep in consideration.

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Sitara mumbles incoherently.

You have emoted: Leoja leans her head sideways, resting it lightly on Xavin&#39;s shoulder, allowing her gills to flap softly as she glances curiously at Sitara.

Sitara murmurs something softly to Xavin.

You say, "I understand if that price is not worth it to you, Miss."

You say, "Some people have less to spend on quality than others, after all."

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Sitara flicks her eyes back and forth between Xavin and Leoja, her eyes resting on each one in turn. She looks terribly confused and angry, and at the same time strangely aroused, the flush having never left her face.

You have emoted: Leoja smiles faintly at Sitara, her hand gently rubbing over Xavin&#39;s shoulder.

You say to Xavin, "I guess that would conclude things, then?"

Sitara snarls and throws her head to the side, clawing at her own face. "Thirty-five thousand!"

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Stupid whore!"

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Don&#39;t TOUCH HIM!"

Jin&#39;s eyes gleam with generosity.

Jin gives 500 gold sovereigns to you.

Jin rubs his hands together greedily.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus frowns and says to Sitara, "Dear...why is this making you so angry?"

You have emoted: Leoja pulls her hand away, pulling her head up as she inquisitively regards the small figure. "Right, as you prefer, Miss." she replies, the smile never leaving her face.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to Xavin, "Because she&#39;s putting her nasty whorehands on you! And and not...."

Xavin grins mischievously at Sitara.

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

You say to Sitara, "I&#39;ll remind you I&#39;m a Lady of Comforts. Far more than just a whore."

Sitara blinks.

Sitara glares angrily at Xavin.

You say to Xavin, "For that matter, I&#39;ll remind you, too."

You smile at Xavin.

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says to you, "Of course. I&#39;d not forget it."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "Comforts my pretty little ass! You suck cock and wallow in depravity for money! Gods know coin probably makes you wet! Quit lying and get on with it!"

Xavin taps his nose knowingly.

You say to Sitara, "The Gods know my naked appearance makes you succumb to your shallow mind, Miss. I wonder about the way I&#39;d look when I actually take care of my appearance, with the help of all that gold. Hmm?"

Sitara gives an icy hiss.

Jin remarks casually, almost as if to himself, "I dunno, I kind of like the slightly scruffy look. Adds a bit of charm." His hand tilting back and forth to swirl the liquid around inside the flagon.

You say to Xavin, "I think she is aware of how much more I can offer in that case."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to you, "Nasty slut! Here I am bidding gold I don&#39;t have on a nasty little creature I don&#39;t want just because she has a nice rack, all when I could be DIDDLING myself in the comfort of my own home!"

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus nods slowly at you.

Xavin blinks.

You say to Sitara, "Then, Miss, by all means, allow Xavin to take me home. I believe he is very interested in my services."

You tell Sitara Nebre&#39;seir, "And well, diddling is all it would ever be for you, I suppose?"

Sitara shrieks as if in agony and stomps at the ground like a mad horse. "I...HAVEN&#39;T...THE MONEY!" Each word is punctuated by another stop in the dirt.

You tell Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus, "So, kind sir, will you be making another offer?"

Sitara tells you, "Nonsense! I can find a willing body ANYWHERE!"

You say to Sitara, "Oh, I take downpayments, Miss. You can pay me half now, and half when half a year has passed."

Xavin tells you, "It seems my coin purse is getting a bit light...but you say you take down payments?"

Jin raises his flagon a bit, "So, is this closed bidding, or can anyone join in?"

Sitara glares about herself, upset with the world.

You tell Sitara Nebre&#39;seir, "A body like mine? Full, round nipples, a wet chamber down below that has your nose sniffing it out for all of its fragrance, my lips that tempt yours in turn? I notice those looks."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to Jin, "You keep your nasty little gold to yourself! She&#39;s mine!"

You tell Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus, "I do. Half for the first six months, half for the next six months."

Jin says to Sitara, "I need something to spend it on besides booze, you know."

Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.

Xavin tells you, "What are the chances of you accepting an arrangement for both she and I?"

Xavin ponders the situation.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir stares at you silently for a while, her hands folded over her chest. After a moment, her eyes go wide, and her cheeks become a little bit more flushed, and finally, she shrieks out, "forty thousand, that&#39;s it, that&#39;s all, she&#39;s DONE!"

You tell Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus, "I only take a single customer at one time. I do not wish my clients to become unhappy due to my having multiple allegiances at the same time."

Xavin chews thoughtfully on his lip.

Xavin tells you, "A pity..."

Xavin tells you, "It could be truly enjoyable."

You tell Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus, "It is a service to my customers. I could be like a whore and sell myself to all whom want me. It is this extra quality that makes me worth the price paid."

Xavin tells you, "I suppose I understand that..."

You have emoted: Leoja smiles at Sitara. "Very well, if the gentlemen has no bid to place, I&#39;ll take your downpayment for the first six months now." she says, slipping her arm away from Xavin&#39;s as she walks towards Sitara.

Xavin chews thoughtfully on his lip.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "Hmph! Godsbedamned down payment...ass fuck cunt WHORE..."

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says, "I&#39;ve got to go beetle."

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.

Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir says to Xavin, "At least he didn&#39;t put his cock in it. Filthy whore&#39;s no good for him anyway. Make him smell like rancid pond water."

With a soft hiss, Sitara launches herself at a carrion beetle, battering him in a frenzied flurry of strikes.
Sitara has scored a CRITICAL hit!
The final blow proves too much for a carrion beetle, who expires, pitifully.
A carrion beetle has been slain by Sitara.

You smile at Sitara.

Sitara picks up the corpse of a carrion beetle.

Xavin gives some gold sovereigns to Sitara.

Xavin gives a pained sigh.

Sitara blinks.

You say, "Only after sufficient payment has been made will my service extend that far."

Jin stands up from where he was leaning, brushing off the front of his robe, "Well, while you do your beetling, I&#39;ll pay the young lady a decent sum to come with me for.. oh, the next 20 minutes, I think." he ponders idly, then shrugs, "How much? Would 5000 cover it, or would 10,000 be more to your liking?"

Sitara hisses vehemently at Jin.

Sitara gives 20000 gold sovereigns to you.

Sitara shrieks in frustration.

Jin chuckles just a bit, "And misunderstandings be damned, you dont get to know why I want her, either."

Xavin slumps and takes his place back at the bar.

You have emoted: Leoja slips her arm under Sitara&#39;s, and shakes her head sadly at Jin. "I&#39;m afraid I already have a client, Sir." she says, her hand softly rubbing over her shoulder.

Sitara gives some gold sovereigns to Xavin.

Sitara mumbles incoherently.

Today is the 9th of Khepary, year 253 of the Midnight Age.
Your innate calendar sense tells you it is spring.
In your world it is Friday, the 22nd of August, in the year 2008.

Jin says, "Oh? I see. Does that mean I have to wait the whole year, or simply pay twice her bid now?"

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir reaches over and takes your hand in hers, her grip iron hard, and begins to lead her out the door. "Come along, then...my LADY..." she says with a sneer in her voice. "You have yet to see Sitara&#39;s home..."

Jin says, "It seems a lot just to get 20 minutes of your time, but I&#39;m bored, and it needs to be done."

Jin ponders Sitara&#39;s profile, deep in consideration.

You say to Jin, "A contract has been made, sir. I accepted her downpayment. Once she fails to pay me, I&#39;ll be free to extend my services to you."

Xavin gives a pained sigh.

Jin says, "Such it is, then, such it is."

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says to Sitara, "You&#39;re welcome, dear one."

You say to Jin, "I look forward to meeting you.... again. Thank you for your interest."

You smile at Xavin.

You say to Xavin, "And it was nice meeting you."

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.

You begin to follow Sitara.

Jin says to you, "I daresay this was a one time offer, I&#39;m afraid, but do have fun."

Xavin Ve&#39;kahi, Blood Magus says to you, "And you..."

You say to Jin, "Ah, such a shame. Sadly I am quite determined to stick to my ethics towards my customers."

You wink knowingly at Xavin.

You say to Sitara, "Shall we go, Princess?"

Sitara Nebre&#39;seir looks over her shoulder at Xavin, and for a moment a flash of recognition floats through her gaze. Then she throws her head back and "hmph&#39;s" before making her way to the door.'>The bar in the Gargoyle Tavern. (Bloodloch.)
Hafydus the minotaur barkeep stands with meaty arms crossed over his broad chest. A beautifully carved chess board is attached firmly to a heavy stand here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A retired soldier from the Bloodloch army sits here, drunk. A grotesque Nazetu guard stands here, fingering a huge mace threateningly. A small leather sack has been left on the ground. There are 11 opaque shot glasses here. There are 2 fancy glasses here. Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus is here. Jawan Racheim Ve'kahi, Childe of Avaesse is here. He wields a short-necked lute in his left hand. Sitara Nebre'seir is here. She wields a gruesome crescent scythe in her hands. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see a single exit leading south.
Jawan Racheim Ve'kahi, Childe of Avaesse smiles encouraging at Xavin, his gaze a little dimmed by the unaccustomed consumption of alcohol. "That's right... it'll help! A tumble or a romp or whatever you like to call it, it always makes a fellow feel better!"
You have emoted: Leoja staggers into the room, quickly ending up slamming into the bar and holding on to it to keep her balance, before ordering a camilla in a groggy voice.
Sitara Nebre'seir blinks owlishly and scrambles to the side, giving you enough room to stumble around. "Oh my..." she says softly. "Soooooomeone's been into the Absinthe!"
Sitara giggles happily.
Racheim claps his hands together decisively. "Well! I have to be going."
You have emoted: Leoja stares over at Xavin for a few moments, before bursting out in laughter and raising her glass up high. "Of course I am, dearie." she sweetly croaks out with her hoarse voice, before gulping some of the drink down.
Xavin seems to think for a moment before nodding slowly at Racheim.
You drain the last drops of bloody camilla from the glass.
Xavin grins mischievously at you.
Sitara stares at Leoja, even ash she leans back even further and wraps her arms around Xavin, as if for protection.
Racheim is enveloped in translucent fire for a moment and is gone, his soul safe until he returns to Aetolia.
Sitara stares at you and blinks.
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
You have emoted: Leoja tilts her head slightly, her gills flapping slightly as she studies Sitara. "Absinthe is vile and only for petty sluts." she announces in a loud voice, slamming her glass down on the bar.
Sitara gasps in shock, her hands flying to her mouth, even as her gaze hardens. "You wouldn't dare insult King Absinthe like that!" she screams, hopping off her barstool. "Absinthe is the drink of royalty! Like Sitara!"
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "And anyway, she has no room to call anyone a petty slut. SHE is not even clothed, much to brother's dismay!"
Sitara Nebre'seir says to Xavin, "Isn't that right brother? The sight of naked girl-flesh just turns your stomach, doesn't it?"
Xavin brushes a hand through his mane, a wide grin drawing across his face. "I wouldn't go that far, dear Sitara."
You have emoted: Leoja rolls her eyes, leaning over the bar towards a bottle of Camille and refilling her glass. "Absinthe is vile." she mutters as she turns around, dragging her cleavage off the bar to get into a somewhat more dignifying position as she proudly straightens herself towards Sitara. "And I am infinitely more a woman than you." she muses, her voice finding some of its smoothness back after the drink.
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
You have emoted: Leoja peers at Xavin, "What? Can't you make a woman feels proud of her body and state your admiration out loud?" she says, slamming her glass back down as she leans back against the bar.
Sitara Nebre'seir blinks at you in shocked silence, for perhaps the first time in her life completely unsure of what to say. Finally she crosses her arms over her chest and huffs, stamping her boot like a child. "Hmph! Height has nothing to do with anything!" she states, matter-of-factly, standing on her tip-toes as best as her boots will allow.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus looks you over hungrily for a moment. "Such things need not be said, miss...?", he says softly.
Sitara whirls and glares at Xavin. "BroTHER!"
You have emoted: Leoja offers Xavin a little smile as her fingers run over the well-rounded flesh of her left breast, circling the nipple before tenderly flicking it a moment, her gills flapping intently for a moment or two as that happens. "It is not about height, dearie, it is about fullness. About quality. About tenderness." The former words were aimed at Sitara, but the latter are obviously moreso directed at Xavin.
Your need for sustenance is becoming serious. You must find food soon or you will begin to suffer harm.
Sitara Nebre'seir turns back around, opening her mouth to say something in return, but only stops and stares at your hand as it works it's way over you body. "Oh my..." is the only thing she can manage.
Sitara murmurs something softly to Xavin.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus's eyes rake across Leoja's form as his tongue darts out to lick his lips. Turning to Sitara, he leans close to whisper something in her ear.
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
You have emoted: Leoja smiles widely as she pushes herself away from the bar, daintily walking her way towards the two, allowing her rack to bounce with every step. Her eyes remain in contact with Xavin, amusement and wickedness alight in them. She takes his hand, not saying a word.
Sitara Nebre'seir squeaks and steps back, watching the interaction with a hint of dismay. "Hey!" she screams. "You can't just..." her voice trails off, as she has no idea what to say, and still her eyes are focused on your chest.
Sitara Nebre'seir mutters, "Bitch..."
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus's eyes widen as you takes his hand, his eyes clearly focused on her naked flesh. As he watches her, his tail begins to sway lazily behind him.
With a slightly desperate look in her eyes, Sitara glances around the room for a solution. Finally downing her last shot of tequila, she throws the glass to the corner and reaches behind her back, tugging at the bow that holds her corset to her body. She takes a deep breath, pushing the corset outward, and then letting it fall away to expose her full breasts, her nipples immediately hardening in the cool air.
Sitara removes a black satin and lace corset.
You have emoted: Leoja gently guides the hand to rest on the breast she played with moments ago, her eyes focused on the man in front of her and ignoring the pesky little human vampiress. "How does that feel? Mighty, does it not?" she coos softly, pressing herself closer against the man. "It could all be yours for a modest reimbursement." she sweetly adds, grinning slightly at Sitara when noticing the admiration. "That goes for you too, dearie." she adds, her eyes back at Xavin already.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus softly squeezes the breast beneath his hand, his claws resting lightly against the flesh. As Sitara removes her corset he stops and stares at her for a long moment.
Sitara tells you, "(Hold on, I've got one coming...)"
[2266] [2713] [eb] 17:46.141 -
You tell Sitara Nebre'seir, "((Ok, I'll wait for your emote.))"
[2266] [2713] [eb] 17:56.366 -
You tell Sitara Nebre'seir, "((To hell with that, you're taking too long.))"
You have emoted: Leoja giggles lightly as she gently rubs herself against Xavin, wrapping her arms around him before tilting her head to look at Sitara. "Ooh, so you've got a rack. Very well done, dear. Sadly, just a rack won't make you a woman." she says, winking slightly at Xavin.
Sitara squeals in protest, then scurries up to Xavin and takes his free hand, placing it upon her breast. She takes a breath, pushing the soft, willing flesh into his palm, and even manages a little moan as her nipple brushes against his fingers. She grins smugly and looks over at Leoja. "Ball's in your court, bitch."
You have emoted: Leoja laughs softly at Sitara. "Fine, I take it you'll be paying me, then." With those words, she leans close to Xavin, pressing her nose against his, allowing her lips to momentarily friction over his, before drawing him closer into a seductive, lingering kiss that last several seconds.
Silvie arrives from the south.
Silvie gives a shoddy tartan scarf to Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus.
Silvie gives a stack of 15 red inks to Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus.
Silvie nods her head at herself.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says, "Silvie...Thank you. I'll open it later, ok? Now's not a good time."
Silvie nods her head emphatically.
You murmur to Xavin, "You've got a lovely child, to see her willing to pay for your pleasures like this."
Silvie utters several words under her breath.
Slick blood in its wake, a flesh golem enters from the ether.
Silvie utters a word of command to her golem.
With a powerful shove, a flesh golem pushes Silvie south.
Silvie leaves to the ether.
Xavin murmurs to you, "She's not my childe...she's the childe of my sire."
Slick blood in its wake, a flesh golem stumbles out to the ether.
You murmur to Xavin, "Still, she's a darling, offering to pay like that. She must like you a lot."
Sitara Nebre'seir shrieks and pushes her hand in front of your face, trying to break up the unheard conversation. "Silly unclothed whore!" She screams, reaching up and grabbing your wrists in her hands. she pushes her backwards, still holding her in a firm grip. "You don't get to touch him unless I say!"
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus swallows hard as his eyes shift between the two of you, almost as he can't quite decide who to look at more. At Sitara's outburst his jaw drops and he shakes his head. "Dear one...calm. Please?"
Your legs begin to tremble with weakness and you feel light-headed and dizzy. The thought of food looms foremost in your mind.
You have emoted: Leoja is easily pushed away, and she grins slightly. "Sure, Miss. I'd like to be paid up front from here on, though." she sweetly says, her gills softly flapping as her eyes seek out Xavin's. "I have my expenses."
Nahira ignores everyone but the minotaur as she walks directly towards him, slamming a handful of coins on the bar.
Nahira buys an opaque shot glass with tequila.
Sitara throws her head over her shoulder and hisses grandly at Xavin, only giving him a second's attention before turning back to Leoja. "Can she pay you to put some CLOTHING on, silly whore? And perhaps suck some poison and die screaming? Yes? Brother is off-limits! He's FRAGILE!"
Your mental equilibrium is disturbed by overpowering thoughts of food.
Your legs collapse from under you and consciousness leaves you as you pass out from extreme hunger.
You regain consciousness with a start.
You double over in pain as your stomach virtually collapses.
Sitara blinks.
Nahira shoves the empty shot glass moodily back across the bar, gesturing for a refill with one hand as she slides some more coins from her back and onto the bar with her other.
Sitara Nebre'seir nudges you with one foot.
Xavin takes a deep breath, shaking his head. "Well...that's..."
You have emoted: Leoja smiles somewhat, reassuredly stepping towards Sitara. "Yes you can pay me for all that, Miss." she sweetly says, before leaning closer to her and placing her hands on her shoulders. "I am just trying to make a li.." she says, before her feet collapse beneath her and she ungracefully sails towards the floor.
Xavin leaves to the south.
You see Sitara Nebre'seir yell, "Brother! Get her some food!"
Xavin arrives from the south.
Xavin gives 6 rabbits to you.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says, "Eat something, would you? Looks painful."
Sitara Nebre'seir stares down at you, and again nudges you with her foot. "Garn then, silly girl. Eat up."
You have emoted: Leoja looks up weakly, and smiles momentarily before eagerly ripping a limb off the rabbit, and stuffing it in her mouth.
You quickly devour a skewer of rabbit meat.
Nahira sips on her refilled glass a bit more slowly this time, glancing idly around the bar as she works on the clear liquid within it.
You quickly devour a skewer of rabbit meat.
Sitara stares implacably at you.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "What is your name, silly naked whore."
You have emoted: With the blood seeping over her lips and towards her chin Leoja shakes her head. "Lady of comfort. Confidante. Not -whore-." she stresses, the back of her hand running over her chin to wipe the blood away some. "Leoja Annay."
Jin's eyes gleam with generosity.
Jin gives a dusky, twilit sapphire dress to you.
Jin rubs his hands together greedily.
Sitara Nebre'seir sniffs and nudges you with her foot once more. "Mother calls us "Hares in mating season." yes.
Nahira takes a long swallow that finishes the tequila in her glass before setting the glass back on the bar. Pushing herself off the stool where she'd perched, she moves towards the door again, tossing her hair over her shoulders as she goes.
Nahira leaves to the south.
You have emoted: Leoja drops her head in her neck, momentarily glancing at the stranger who tossed the dress towards her before glancing back at Sitara. "Maybe you. I'm more of a chittering bird offering shelter in winter." she says softly, again eagerly biting down on the remainders of her rabbit.
Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.
Sitara Nebre'seir stares down at you with her hands on her hips, her chest heaving in a mixture of anger and bitter amusement. "She is as mad as Sitara, yesss...well. Come up little whore. Or ah...Lady of co...lady of com...slut! Let us get you some clothing, yes? You will freeze!"
Dusky and deep as the starless firmament at twilight, rich azure colors hue this dress, the silky folds dyed masterfully to emulate the span of the sky between day and night. Inky indigo, lustering on jet black, frames the face and decolletage, accented by carved sapphire gems, crafted to emulate roses frozen in a glassy bloom. Tightly tracing the contours of the body, the dress wraps around the torso, the material blushing lighter, seamlessly, into a dark, shadowed blend of navy and violet. Curving around the hips and trailing downwards in a satiny fall of dwindling chroma, the garment ends at the feet in a melting wash of blue, the cerulean pure and deep.
It has 57 months of usefulness left.
It weighs about 3 pounds and 0 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Moirean Seirath, Huntress of the Wilds.
Jin says, "She already has a rather nice dress, I don't think she'll freeze."
Jin says, "Suffer from drafts, maybe, but not freeze."
Sitara snorts and points to the girl's naked breasts, and her prominent, hardened nipples. "Look at her!" she huffs. "She'll put someone's eye out with those things! She needs a bra, yes?"
You have emoted: Leoja holds the dress Jin offered her up for display. "I will hardly die." she mutters as she heaves herself from the floor, slightly unsteady in her legs for the first few moments.
Jin says, "I could think of worse ways to lose an eye."
Xavin grins mischievously at Jin.
Jin says, "Like you waving that scythe around."
Jin says, "Nipples over iron, I say."
Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.
Sitara Nebre'seir snorts and stamps her boot, but says nothing, instead folding her arms over her bare chest once again. She glares at you, and again her eyes stray downward. "Silly whore..." she mutters.
You have emoted: Leoja nods at Jin and sweetly says, "Thank you for the dress. I think the little Lady is just feeling a bit threatened. I can imagine she gets little competition in looks."
You are now wearing a dusky, twilit sapphire dress.
Jin says, "Oh, did I walk in on a territory fight? I suppose I should stay out of it."
You have emoted: After putting the dress on Leoja glances towards Sitara. "Is this a bit better for you, Miss? I owe you for the rabbit, I believe."
Sitara re-ties her corset, cinching the cords a little tighter than normal so that her hips and cleavage are more prominent than before.
Sitara puts on a black satin and lace corset.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus shrugs at you and says, "Common decency. Besides, rabbit isn't exactly expensive, you know?"
Jin scratches at his cheek, "Man, doesn't that just beat all. I walk in on the oddest things."
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Nay, nay she says...twas brother's money..."
Jin swirls his flagon around a bit, "Maybe I need something stronger." he muses to himself.
Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.
Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.
You have emoted: Leoja smiles faintly, and nods towards Xavin in gratitude. "But it was.. your particular voice I heard shrieking to get me food." she offers in weak defense towards Sitara, obviously trying to diffuse the hostilities from earlier.
Sitara chews thoughtfully on her lip.
Sitara snorts and flips her hair out of her eyes with a little flourish. "I only wanted to get you food so I could kill you properly. But now you're all...dressed."
Jin says, "Quite a nice dress, if I do say so myself."
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.
Xavin winks knowingly at Sitara.
Sitara blinks.
You say to Sitara, "Certainly, one as distinguished and special as yourself doesn't hold grudges or a jealousy to a woman making a living. Do you?"
Jin raises an eyebrow just a little.
Jin says, "I must be missing some key part to this."
Sitara blinks owlishly, completely disarmed for a moment. She then straightens up to her full, unimpressive height, and shakes her head. "Oh no...I suppose not. Princess Sitara is a kind and gentle noble, after all. But...but really. Must you be so...you know...blatant? Even Sitara, who fucks like a wild animal in the middle of the street if the mood suits her, would not be so bold."
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says to Jin, "Aye..."
Jin chokes on his mead a bit, then chuckles, "..I don't know what could be much more blatant than fucking like a wild animal in the streets, but I daresay it'd be something akin to rape."
Sitara gives a feral grin and nods vigorously.
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Though...the men Sitara takes to bed never call it rape in the end...no no..."
Sitara giggles happily.
Jin says to you, "Are you a rapist, little lady?"
Sitara tilts her head curiously at you.
The corners of Xavin's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
You have emoted: Leoja giggles lightly, and tilts her head slightly as the gillflapping accompanies it. "Most people who have something to sell, are quite obvious about it. How else will they get customers? If it were a private matter, I'm surely not appalled to closing the door behind me." she says, fluttering her eyelashes at Sitara. "Honestly, I meant no offense to you.... princess?" The last word comes out more as a question to the sanity of the title than a question of accepting the apology made.
You smile and say to Jin, "Only when I've been paid up handsomely in front for the act, sir."
Jin hits his left hand into the palm of his right, "Ahah, she's a whore. I see, so that wasn't just being insulting. So does that mean you both are?" he asks curiously, looking from one to the other, then shrugs a bit and takes another pull on his flagon.
Xavin bites his lip, a wide grin on his face. "Careful there...I doubt either of them appreciate being called a whore."
You say to Jin, "Lady of comforts would be my choice of words."
Jin says, "Hey, you dont call a bartender a 'liquid refreshment dispenser' nor a killer a 'people handling service'."
Jin says, "Is what it is."
"Hmph!" Sitara proclaims. "She is not a whore!" She turns to you and grins widely, placing her hands on her hips. "She is Sitara Nebre'seir, Princess of the Stars! She is ruler of all she surveys, and that includes, at the moment, this bar!"
Sitara nods her head affirmatively.
You say to Jin, "Well, probably because they also prepare meals, and offer protection to others in the second case. It's a matter of looking at the whole package, compared to just a simple fuck."
Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "Oh, you're being too modest, dear girl...far too modest. There is no such thing as a simple fuck..."
Jin says to Sitara, "You look like a little kid, honestly."
Jin shrugs helplessly.
Jin drains the last dregs of smooth honey mead from a flagon.
Sitara snorts arrogantly.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to Jin, "That's because you're not looking with the right eyes!"
Jin says to Sitara, "You mean I haven't had enough to drink? Yes, I believe I said something akin to that earlier."
You say to Sitara, "A fuck just pleases the body, 'Princess'. A good lady of comforts eases and consoles the mind first."
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "Oh tch...eases and consoles the mind...rubbish, rubbish! What could be more consoling than wallowing in the depravity of your own orgasm..."
Jin says, "Sounds like the makings of a contest. I'll do my duty and take on the onerous position of judge."
Jin snickers under his breath.
Xavin peers at Jin suspiciously.
You say to Sitara, "I don't know... actually considering yourself to be a person, rather than talking about yourself with the third person and using the title of princess?"
Sitara opens her mouth to say something more, but has seemingly caught herself off guard. Instead she simply stares off into space, a slight flush rising to her cheeks. She clears her throat and folds her hands behind her back once more.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "Let me ask, pretty thing...does she enjoy what she does?"
You say to Sitara, "I love my work. I'd not do it otherwise."
Sitara creases her brow in a frown.
Sitara purses her lips, deep in thought.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "...and...you get PAYED..."
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "To...fuck?"
Jin says, "And just how much do you get paid? Now that we're on the subject."
You have emoted: Leoja allows her gills to flap twice, and she shakes her head. "To be a Lady of Comforts. The pay determines the amount of comfort extended."
Xavin ponders the situation.
Jin says, "Sounds dubious. I like my wares to be a bit more cut and dry when it comes to my purse."
Jin nods his head sagely.
You say to Jin, "That depends on the services required. I am not cheap, though. My customers do not want a used body of flesh, they want a Lady. You can't get a lady without paying the proper amount of respect."
Jin says to you, "If by respect, you mean gold, then fair enough."
You say to Jin, "Gold and manners. I merely take one client at a time, however."
Xavin ponders the situation.
Jin says to you, "No group therapy?"
Jin snickers under his breath.
Sitara , who has been watching the exchange silently for some time, suddenly raises her hand happily. "Not her! No no! She takes two and three at a time, if the price is right!"
Sitara blinks.
Sitara grins sheepishly.
Xavin murmurs to you, "When you say that you aren't cheap...what price range do you mean?"
You have emoted: Leoja is confused for a moment, before the use of Sitara's third person dawns on her. "I am sure your standards aren't as high as mine, no." she kindly replies.
Sitara's breath catches in a gasp of surprise.
Jin coughs a bit, stifling a chuckle as he then takes another quick sip of his flagon.
Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Standards? You're...you're getting payed to let someone stick their junk in your hooha! What standards?!?"
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "And where's the blood FUN IN STANDARDS?"
You murmur to Xavin, "Oh, it honestly depends on the amount of services you require. Just the flesh, or also a smart girl to challenge your mind? Someone to flaunt with in public?"
Jin's eyes gleam with generosity.
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Ahem. Bloody, that is."
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Eheh."
Jin gives 500 gold sovereigns to you.
Jin rubs his hands together greedily.
Jin says, "That was worth that."
You smile at Jin.
You smile and say to Jin, "I'm glad you find a simple conversation this entertaining, sir."
Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.
Jin says to you, "I'm a simple creature."
Sitara murmurs something softly to Jin.
Xavin murmurs to you, "The flesh and intelligent conversation...I'd like my mind to be taken off things for a while."
Sitara murmurs something softly to Jin.
You say to Sitara, "Oh, don't tell me you have never been tempted to call yourself a Lady. A princess is a nice title, but it means nothing. A man wants a woman that reaches up to his stature, someone who can be as radiant as he is strong, and not look diminutive in comparison."
Jin says to Sitara, "Looks like she already has an interested party, anyway, and she did say she only takes single clients."
Jin snickers under his breath.
Sitara mutters discontentedly.
Sitara Nebre'seir exclaims to Jin, "BROTHER IS NOT AN INTERESTED CLIENT!"
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "Lady Lady Lady...titles are irrelevant. Our drunken friend here..."
Sitara pokes at Jin pointedly.
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Has a point."
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Why call yourself a lady? Euphemisms are just little lies."
You have emoted: Leoja smiles at Xavin, before flirtatiously running her hand over his cheek. "That could be arranged." she muses before she turns back to Sitara. "And no, I am sure he isn't, Miss."
Sitara blinks.
Sitara glares angrily at Xavin.
Sitara murmurs something softly to Xavin.
Jin slaps his knee, laughing again, unable to stifle it this time as he throws his head back and laughs loudly.
Jin says, "Oh gods."
Jin's eyes gleam with generosity.
Jin gives 500 gold sovereigns to you.
Jin rubs his hands together greedily.
Your eyes sparkle with amusement as you gaze upon Jin.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus brushes a hand through his mane, smiling innocently at Sitara. "The specifics of it don't matter much, dear one."
Sitara shrieks in frustration.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to Xavin, "Tell me or I'll rip your cock off of your body and strangle you with it!"
Xavin purses his lips pensively, gazing thoughtfully at some distant point.
You have emoted: Leoja pulls her hand away from Xavin, and walks to Sitara. "I don't mean to offend you though, Miss. It is merely my job." she says, smiling lightly as she leans closer to the 'princess'.
Calmly, Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says to Sitara, "Why would you do that, dear one? I'd say it would serve you better to leave it attached, hrm?"
You murmur to Sitara, "You could just take my services, you know. Pay me handsomely, and I won't take another client. I take it you understand my meaning of confidentiality, so I can't confirm or deny anything... but you might just enjoy my services."
Jin says to you, "Ahh, my my. Well, if you're ever without custom and in need of work, do look me up."
Sitara opens her mouth and hisses warningly, though even as she does so her eyes flick over to Xavin, her own gaze becoming confused. She leans back as Leoja leans forward, raising her scythe as if to ward her away somehow. "You...evil seductress thing! Trying to take brother away!"
You have emoted: Leoja turns around fluently, allowing the dress to sweep around her in a medium-wide arc. "I will, thank you dear Sir. I am usually around these parts when I'm unemployed anyhow." she says.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to Xavin, "Would it make him feel better if she asked for payment? five thousand gold for a roll in the hay with her, yes!"
Jin says, "Good, good, maybe I can send you off harpy slaying for personal amusement."
Sitara flutters her eyelashes at Xavin.
You have emoted: Leoja blinks her eyes widely, shaking her head. "You get me wrong, Miss. My clients confidentiality is their own. If your brother hired me, I would not allow myself to tell anyone without his consent."
Xavin raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.
Jin says to you, "Busy currently, I take it?"
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Sitara murmurs something softly to Xavin.
Sitara glares angrily at Xavin.
Xavin purses his lips pensively, gazing thoughtfully at some distant point.
You say, "A Lady of Comforts is very strict with the confidentiality of those she has given services to - it can sometimes reflect wrongly on the clients in question. So I am afraid any accusations are merely the product of your own unwishful thinking."
You say to Jin, "I probably am, yes."
Jin says, "Shame, shame."
Sitara Nebre'seir stares at you, completely confused by the jumble of words.
Sitara ceases to wield a gruesome crescent scythe, securing it to her weaponbelt.
You tell Jin, "The princess amuses me to no end right now, I am afraid."
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "...hmph..."
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Jin tells you, "Oh, I wouldn't dream of dragging anyone away from this, its more amusement than I've had in years of staged entertainment."
You have emoted: Leoja smiles kindly at Xavin again before shrugging at Sitara. "Well, just remember what I told you, Miss. It is merely my job."
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus flashes you a charming smile before dropping a few coins on the bar.
Xavin buys a blackened glass with red wine.
Xavin blinks.
Xavin takes a long draught of red wine.
Sitara Nebre'seir mutters something under her breath and leans forward, giving you a little sniff. She crouches, circling around you in a defensive position, as if sizing her up. Finally she comes back around to the front and stands up straight once more.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "How much."
You have emoted: Leoja smiles sweetly at Xavin before walking to him, and slipping her arm under his while the small one is circling her. "Make me an offer." she replies coyly, both to the girl and the man whoms arm she has pinched beneath hers.
Sitara huffs in exasperation. "t...two thousand!"
Sitara glares angrily at some gold sovereigns.
You have emoted: Leoja laughs softly, shaking her head. "Dear, dear. I'm not talking for a short term. I'm talking for a prolonged period. You should add another zero at the least."
Sitara blinks.
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "...pro..."
Sitara chews thoughtfully on her lip.
Softly, Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says, "That sounds agreeable...how long would that cover?"
You say to Xavin, "You know. Like meals together in the evening. Walks in the moonlight. Galas. Whatever kind of services you'd require."
Sitara shouts "Oi!" at the top of her voice.
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Twenty-five thousand, damnit!"
You say to Xavin, "That would cover basic company for a year. Specific services would mean the price goes up, naturally."
You smile at Sitara.
Xavin purses his lips pensively, gazing thoughtfully at some distant point.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says, "I'll call it thirty thousand."
Sitara stares implacably at some gold sovereigns.
Xavin ponders some gold sovereigns's profile, deep in consideration.
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Sitara mumbles incoherently.
You have emoted: Leoja leans her head sideways, resting it lightly on Xavin's shoulder, allowing her gills to flap softly as she glances curiously at Sitara.
Sitara murmurs something softly to Xavin.
You say, "I understand if that price is not worth it to you, Miss."
You say, "Some people have less to spend on quality than others, after all."
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Sitara flicks her eyes back and forth between Xavin and Leoja, her eyes resting on each one in turn. She looks terribly confused and angry, and at the same time strangely aroused, the flush having never left her face.
You have emoted: Leoja smiles faintly at Sitara, her hand gently rubbing over Xavin's shoulder.
You say to Xavin, "I guess that would conclude things, then?"
Sitara snarls and throws her head to the side, clawing at her own face. "Thirty-five thousand!"
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Stupid whore!"
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Don't TOUCH HIM!"
Jin's eyes gleam with generosity.
Jin gives 500 gold sovereigns to you.
Jin rubs his hands together greedily.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus frowns and says to Sitara, "Dear...why is this making you so angry?"
You have emoted: Leoja pulls her hand away, pulling her head up as she inquisitively regards the small figure. "Right, as you prefer, Miss." she replies, the smile never leaving her face.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to Xavin, "Because she's putting her nasty whorehands on you! And and not...."
Xavin grins mischievously at Sitara.
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
You say to Sitara, "I'll remind you I'm a Lady of Comforts. Far more than just a whore."
Sitara blinks.
Sitara glares angrily at Xavin.
You say to Xavin, "For that matter, I'll remind you, too."
You smile at Xavin.
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says to you, "Of course. I'd not forget it."
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "Comforts my pretty little ass! You suck cock and wallow in depravity for money! Gods know coin probably makes you wet! Quit lying and get on with it!"
Xavin taps his nose knowingly.
You say to Sitara, "The Gods know my naked appearance makes you succumb to your shallow mind, Miss. I wonder about the way I'd look when I actually take care of my appearance, with the help of all that gold. Hmm?"
Sitara gives an icy hiss.
Jin remarks casually, almost as if to himself, "I dunno, I kind of like the slightly scruffy look. Adds a bit of charm." His hand tilting back and forth to swirl the liquid around inside the flagon.
You say to Xavin, "I think she is aware of how much more I can offer in that case."
Sitara Nebre'seir says to you, "Nasty slut! Here I am bidding gold I don't have on a nasty little creature I don't want just because she has a nice rack, all when I could be DIDDLING myself in the comfort of my own home!"
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus nods slowly at you.
Xavin blinks.
You say to Sitara, "Then, Miss, by all means, allow Xavin to take me home. I believe he is very interested in my services."
You tell Sitara Nebre'seir, "And well, diddling is all it would ever be for you, I suppose?"
Sitara shrieks as if in agony and stomps at the ground like a mad horse. "I...HAVEN'T...THE MONEY!" Each word is punctuated by another stop in the dirt.
You tell Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus, "So, kind sir, will you be making another offer?"
Sitara tells you, "Nonsense! I can find a willing body ANYWHERE!"
You say to Sitara, "Oh, I take downpayments, Miss. You can pay me half now, and half when half a year has passed."
Xavin tells you, "It seems my coin purse is getting a bit light...but you say you take down payments?"
Jin raises his flagon a bit, "So, is this closed bidding, or can anyone join in?"
Sitara glares about herself, upset with the world.
You tell Sitara Nebre'seir, "A body like mine? Full, round nipples, a wet chamber down below that has your nose sniffing it out for all of its fragrance, my lips that tempt yours in turn? I notice those looks."
Sitara Nebre'seir says to Jin, "You keep your nasty little gold to yourself! She's mine!"
You tell Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus, "I do. Half for the first six months, half for the next six months."
Jin says to Sitara, "I need something to spend it on besides booze, you know."
Jin takes a long draught of smooth honey mead.
Xavin tells you, "What are the chances of you accepting an arrangement for both she and I?"
Xavin ponders the situation.
Sitara Nebre'seir stares at you silently for a while, her hands folded over her chest. After a moment, her eyes go wide, and her cheeks become a little bit more flushed, and finally, she shrieks out, "forty thousand, that's it, that's all, she's DONE!"
You tell Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus, "I only take a single customer at one time. I do not wish my clients to become unhappy due to my having multiple allegiances at the same time."
Xavin chews thoughtfully on his lip.
Xavin tells you, "A pity..."
Xavin tells you, "It could be truly enjoyable."
You tell Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus, "It is a service to my customers. I could be like a whore and sell myself to all whom want me. It is this extra quality that makes me worth the price paid."
Xavin tells you, "I suppose I understand that..."
You have emoted: Leoja smiles at Sitara. "Very well, if the gentlemen has no bid to place, I'll take your downpayment for the first six months now." she says, slipping her arm away from Xavin's as she walks towards Sitara.
Xavin chews thoughtfully on his lip.
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "Hmph! Godsbedamned down payment...ass fuck cunt WHORE..."
Sitara Nebre'seir says, "I've got to go beetle."
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Sitara wrinkles her nose and sniffs.
Xavin murmurs something softly to Sitara.
Sitara Nebre'seir says to Xavin, "At least he didn't put his cock in it. Filthy whore's no good for him anyway. Make him smell like rancid pond water."
With a soft hiss, Sitara launches herself at a carrion beetle, battering him in a frenzied flurry of strikes.
Sitara has scored a CRITICAL hit!
The final blow proves too much for a carrion beetle, who expires, pitifully.
A carrion beetle has been slain by Sitara.
With a soft hiss, Sitara launches herself at a carrion beetle, battering him in a frenzied flurry of strikes.
Sitara has scored a CRITICAL hit!
The final blow proves too much for a carrion beetle, who expires, pitifully.
A carrion beetle has been slain by Sitara.
You smile at Sitara.
Sitara picks up the corpse of a carrion beetle.
Sitara picks up the corpse of a carrion beetle.
Xavin gives some gold sovereigns to Sitara.
Xavin gives a pained sigh.
Sitara blinks.
You say, "Only after sufficient payment has been made will my service extend that far."
Jin stands up from where he was leaning, brushing off the front of his robe, "Well, while you do your beetling, I'll pay the young lady a decent sum to come with me for.. oh, the next 20 minutes, I think." he ponders idly, then shrugs, "How much? Would 5000 cover it, or would 10,000 be more to your liking?"
Sitara hisses vehemently at Jin.
Sitara gives 20000 gold sovereigns to you.
Sitara shrieks in frustration.
Jin chuckles just a bit, "And misunderstandings be damned, you dont get to know why I want her, either."
Xavin slumps and takes his place back at the bar.
You have emoted: Leoja slips her arm under Sitara's, and shakes her head sadly at Jin. "I'm afraid I already have a client, Sir." she says, her hand softly rubbing over her shoulder.
Sitara gives some gold sovereigns to Xavin.
Sitara mumbles incoherently.
Today is the 9th of Khepary, year 253 of the Midnight Age.
Your innate calendar sense tells you it is spring.
In your world it is Friday, the 22nd of August, in the year 2008.
Jin says, "Oh? I see. Does that mean I have to wait the whole year, or simply pay twice her bid now?"
Sitara Nebre'seir reaches over and takes your hand in hers, her grip iron hard, and begins to lead her out the door. "Come along, then...my LADY..." she says with a sneer in her voice. "You have yet to see Sitara's home..."
Jin says, "It seems a lot just to get 20 minutes of your time, but I'm bored, and it needs to be done."
Jin ponders Sitara's profile, deep in consideration.
You say to Jin, "A contract has been made, sir. I accepted her downpayment. Once she fails to pay me, I'll be free to extend my services to you."
Xavin gives a pained sigh.
Jin says, "Such it is, then, such it is."
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says to Sitara, "You're welcome, dear one."
You say to Jin, "I look forward to meeting you.... again. Thank you for your interest."
You smile at Xavin.
You say to Xavin, "And it was nice meeting you."
You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.
You begin to follow Sitara.
Jin says to you, "I daresay this was a one time offer, I'm afraid, but do have fun."
Xavin Ve'kahi, Blood Magus says to you, "And you..."
You say to Jin, "Ah, such a shame. Sadly I am quite determined to stick to my ethics towards my customers."
You wink knowingly at Xavin.
You say to Sitara, "Shall we go, Princess?"
Sitara Nebre'seir looks over her shoulder at Xavin, and for a moment a flash of recognition floats through her gaze. Then she throws her head back and "hmph's" before making her way to the door.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 2 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4"><div class="alert alert-secondary"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small fst-italic">This comment has been deleted.</p></div></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
