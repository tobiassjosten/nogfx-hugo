I&#39;ve been enjoying reading what others have to say quite a bit."
18:28:00 (Luminaries): Aren says, "Eh I dunno. Been talking it to death."
18:28:14 (Luminaries): Aren says, "Plus our posts sum up what we think..."
18:28:37 You tell Aren, "Humor the girl? Make at least a slight comment on something she said."
18:29:02 You tell Aren, "I know it&#39;s pointless, but it&#39;ll make her feel useful and listened to."
18:29:06 Aren tells you, "Peh, I&#39;m irritated to begin with at Catrine, which I&#39;m sure she told you about."
18:29:35 You tell Aren, "She never mentioned names, just actions. I&#39;m dealing with her questions and helping her out. I&#39;ll handle her."
18:29:49 (Luminaries): Aren says, "Let me re-read it."
18:30:00 You tell Aren, "Very much appreciated."
18:30:28 (Luminaries): Aren says, "Alright."
18:31:00 (Luminaries): Aren says, "I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re thinking when you say that lying and manipulation is bad but being undead is not."
18:33:22 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s morally bad. I see it as a physical state. If someone chooses to be undead, that doesn&#39;t make that person bad anymore than say...removing one of their own limbs by choice. But it&#39;s not a beneficial way for them to be."
8:33:54 (Luminaries): You say, "To choose to be undead though is to choose to forsake Light and Life."
18:34:02 (Luminaries): Aren says, "You&#39;re wrong there."
18:34:23 (Luminaries): Aren says, "Being undead is taking yourself out of the cycle and rejecting life."
18:35:09 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "Right, and that&#39;s bad for them, but I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s morally bad."
18:35:16 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "...are you serious?"
18:35:18 (Luminaries): Caeli says, "... Yes. It is."
18:35:26 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "You&#39;re Auresian, Valencia. How can you honestly believe that?"
18:35:55 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "Or rather, I should ask: how can you honestly believe that and be Auresian?"
18:37:05 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "I think it makes it a lot easier for people to become evil. I think that forsaking life often leads to them not valuing it in others and promotes cruelty and a loss of humanity. But I don&#39;t think that just being undead makes a person bad."
18:38:06 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "Lady Auresae would vastly disagree."
18:38:11 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "And She does, in point of fact."
18:38:36 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "I know."
18:38:44 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "Undeath is a state that needs to be cured or destroyed, end of story. There is no way around that, not for an Auresian and not for a Luminary."
18:40:41 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "Why do you think that, if you don&#39;t see anything morally or inherently wrong with it?"
18:41:05 You tell Rivas, "(( well executed question, comrade ))"
18:41:16 Rivas tells you, "(*samuraibow*)"
18:42:52 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "Because it leads to bad things without being bad in itself. Imagine a substance like alcohol that nearly always got people addicted and made them behave badly. I&#39;d think that we should get rid of that substance if it was doing so much harm, but I wouldn&#39;t say that the substance itself was evil. Just that it tended to cause lots of harm when people used it."
18:43:26 (Luminaries): Caeli says, "Then why do you say Sciomancy and Subterfuge are evil? They lead down the wrong path, surely, but aren&#39;t they just tools, then?"
18:44:07 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "That&#39;s a horrible comparison, Valencia. Correlating an addictive substance to Undeath makes -no- sense."
18:44:23 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "It&#39;s not about addiction, it&#39;s about harm."
18:44:42 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "And stopping one&#39;s heartbeat and isn&#39;t harmful?"
18:45:27 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "They are walking corpses, Valencia. To insinuate that their presence alone has no bearing on those around them, as well, is quite beyond the realm of believability."
18:45:44 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "I can replace it with another example. My point is that undeath tends to put people in situations where they cause more harm and are harmed more themselves. And as for stopping your heartbeat...if you don&#39;t really die and no one suffers from it then I suppose not."
18:45:45 (Luminaries): You say, "Valecia, in order to become undead, you have to choose it. Now, if I chose to drink that alcohol knowing full well the affects it would have on me, and not caring, would that not make me a bad person?"
18:46:23 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "Caeli, I may have to rethink that a little bit, I&#39;ll get back to you on that."
18:47:02 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "What in the HELL makes you think they don&#39;t die?"
18:47:34 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "They die. They stop living. Stop breathing. They silence their own Inner Spark in the process."
18:47:45 (Luminaries): You say, "Have you read the Revelation, Valencia?"
18:47:49 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "Ah, an excellent point Rayne. And I&#39;d agree if the vast majority of people really thought that undeath was that harmful and chose it anyway. But there is so much disagreement about it that I think it&#39;s hard for ordinary people to know that, especially young ones."
18:48:23 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "You&#39;re deceived because, even though they die, they get up and walk around. THAT&#39;s what&#39;s so unnatural about the state of being. That&#39;s why it&#39;s evil, that&#39;s why it needs to be destroyed. The Undead are the opposite of us. They are our natural enemy, they are the antithesis of everything that is Right and Pure in the world."
18:48:26 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "If people really understood that choosing to be undead was so harmful, then maybe I could condemn them for making that choice rather than pitying them."
18:49:02 (Luminaries): You say, "People understand, Valencia. They all understand. Those that don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t agree, get cured."
18:49:19 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "What makes you so sure people understand?"
18:49:41 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "I&#39;m pretty sure the "slitting their own wrists and burying themselves in the ground" is kinda explanatory."
18:50:50 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "It&#39;s certainly scary and strange, but if you&#39;re doing that to yourself it doesn&#39;t seem morally wrong. It doesn&#39;t seem morally wrong to hurt yourself. It just seems foolish and unpleasant."
18:51:13 (Luminaries): Rivas says, "Becoming that, becoming a walking corpse who roams the earth outside of Life and Death...yeah, that&#39;s morally wrong."
18:51:24 (Luminaries): Aren says, "To hurt yourself in order to become a ...yeah what Rivas said."
18:52:33 (Luminaries): Yvonne says, "Who wants to become what Rivas said?"
18:53:18 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "I don&#39;t, but choosing that for yourself just seems pitiable, not evil."
18:53:29 (Luminaries): You say, "You pity them, I kill them."'>18:24:53 (Luminaries): Valencia says, "I'm actually rather curious to hear what all of you have to say about my words regarding our current discussion. I've been enjoying reading what others have to say quite a bit."
