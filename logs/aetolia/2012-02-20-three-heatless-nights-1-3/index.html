Kiyotan enters from the west, riding a massive arctic wolf.
Kiyotan gracefully hops off of a massive arctic wolf.

She is a dexterous Yeleni. Taller than many mortal men, her shapely and muscular body follows an unnatural feral design. She appears mostly humanoid, but thin, white fur races up the length of her arms and legs, ending at just below the shoulder and upper thigh to fade into dark brown flesh. Similar fur lines her neck and jaw. Her hands are oversized, each tipped with a daggerlike black claw. Her feet are spreading, prehensile constructs of a shape seen in reptiles, the biggest toe of each terminating in a huge, curved talon. A long, whiplike tail extends from the small of her back, tipped with a brushlike tuft of fur. Her face is hidden beneath a glaring mask, a thing of bone, wood, and horn, spattered with blood. Her ears are elfin, one almost a foot long, the other missing the last few inches, as if sheared off. A pair of huge, curling black horns sprout from the dark mane that constitutes her hair, the latter of which hangs down to her rear. Her motions are unsubtly sensual, her gait a sort of quick-footed lope, and when she speaks, her voice is light with breath, muffled by the mask.
She is wearing:
fitted mithril filigree horn ornamentation
a pair of thick armwrap bracers
an oiled loincloth, laden in trinkets
a pair of high top buffalo hide boots
a horned, bestial mask of scorched wood
a pair of straps, comprising a top
She walks with the blessing of Omei.

You have emoted: Lin tugs hair from the snarls of her mask, waiting obediently for Kiyotan in the center of the Hall. Her breathing is quickened.

Lansyr pauses at the hall&#39;s edge, where Kiyotan leaps from his back and marches purposefully toward you. "You have settled your affairs?" he asks when within earshot.

Abruptly settling back on his haunches, a massive arctic wolf tilts his head as a hind-leg rises to scratch vigorously behind an ear.

You have emoted: "Have rested and eaten, no work to do this month." Lin encircles the strap of her kitbag with her fist tightly. "I am ready."

Without another word, Kiyotan halts but a pace before you and pivots sideways, showing you his profile. With his feet spread apart, he reaches out to plant the heel of his palm against the forehead of your mask. His eye closes and head bows in concentration.

Kiyotan closes his eyes and begins to focus.

You have emoted: Lin heaves a percussive sigh and braces herself.

You follow Kiyotan to the ether.
The center of an infinite crossroads.
Amid an endless field of green grass, a crossroads of beaten earth divides, each leg stretching off into an unchanging horizon, static scenery as far as the eye can see. The dirt paths are razor-straight and wide enough for ten men to walk shoulder-to-shoulder. Overhead, the sky is a perpetual grey haze, forever casting these fields in wan, pale light. Standing out in stark foreignness, the very center of the crossroads&#39;s joint bears a small raised dais of white marble, upon which stands a golden throne. Wrought with elegant and meticulous care and draped with luxurious velvet, this seat bears an alien beauty, exquisite but for its bizarre and alien presence in an otherwise empty field.
Exits: north, east, south, and west.

You have emoted: Lin sways as she gets her bearings, her shoulders lowering as tension leaves them. "This is... different, not..." her thought remains unfinished, her ears pivoting backwards in a curious manner, reminiscent of your mate, as she struggles to capture all of the field in her view.

When the encompassing blaze disperses, you will notice the drastically changed surroundings. Kiyotan removes his hand from your forehead, pausing for a moment to take in the sight of the vast crossroads, each path stretching beyond vision into unchanging distances. With a heavy exhalation, he squares his shoulders and selects the eastern trail, gesturing with an impatient wave for you to follow.

You have emoted: Lin shoulders her heavy cloak and falls into step, her feet crunching into the path and leaving trident-shaped prints.

Though the scenery remains unchanged as the pair of you tread along the eastern road, the world begins to brighten, but not from any particular light source. It is more as if the atmosphere is gradually fading away, becoming indistinct, leaving an empty whiteness in its place. "Stay close," comes Kiyotan&#39;s voice, the blaze of his wings guiding you like a torch. And then, without any warning at all, the world changes and comes into sharp focus.

A harsh, endless tundra under driving snow.
Swirling snow falls from an amaranthine sky of frosty, wintry grey. The ashen clouds blot out the sun, obscuring direction in an endless field of ambiguous white. Details of the bleak landscape are imperceptible amid the interminable blizzard, cutting winds sweeping drifts of snow to meet falling flakes in a constant shift, bearing a chill that bites deep. Any footprints upon the treacherously icy tundra are filled but moments after their birth. Despite air crisp and fresh, the tundra is cold and inhospitable, with nothing but the promise of frigid death in every direction.
Exits: west.

You have emoted: The colder it grows, the tighter Lin pulls her cloak about her person, until all that can be seen of her is thick-furred hands, a pair of horns sprouting from her hood, and the merest shadow suggesting a face. She soldiers on through the snow, but her hunched-over gait suggests her immediate discomfort. Staying close, she raises her voice to be heard by you: "There is no shelter here... h- how will I get out of the winds?"

The cutting wind is the first feature of the tundra to become distinct, buffeting the pair of you--though Kiyotan hardly seems to notice it at all. The snow underfoot becomes noticeable second, and the footprints you leave behind are filled in by the heavy snowfall mere moments after their creation. When finally you speaks, he comes to a dead halt and turns around. "You are a resourceful woman," responds, his tone as cold as the world around him. "If you survive, I will see you one month hence."

You have emoted: Lin scrapes snow away from her mask, and stares at Kiyotan for a long while, motionless and silent. Accepting of her fate, she does an about-face and begins to walk away, intent, it seems, on continuing to move through the abyssal frost. She calls out to Kiyotan, "I will be fine."

"You will be improved," Kiyotan corrects, his voice only barely audible until it, like the Yeleni, fades into the white.

                                   _________
                     _ __ ________/ Day One ________ __ _


You have emoted: Lin presses onward, continuing to travel against all logic or reason. Her attention span proves untrustworthy, and before long she has resorted to myrrh gum, chewing great gobs of it, dreams accompanying her wandering.

The snow swirls tight around you, constricting your vision and numbing your skin. In moments it is as though all sensation has been stripped away by the icy cold, your footsteps barely tangible in the snow beneath you. The myrrh carries your mind away; and as you walk, you sink inward, losing yourself in color, in sensation, in dreamlike visions utterly divorced from your mortal frame.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s breath flutters, though its pace is sluggish and slow - she needs her energy. Tendrils of vapor explore the front of her mask on each exhalation. A steady shiver sets in early on, the cold eager to consume her as quickly as possible, but she does not stop walking, even when it becomes obvious that the bewitched landscape will never change. Quietly, her voice a thick whisper, she sings in some seldom-heard tongue.

The landscape does change, though, even aware as you are of its sheer unrealism; ice turns to trees, white to lush greenery, and the darkness is thick around you, your shivers turning to warmth. Though quite obviously alive and well, the plants have a dark, sanguine sheen to them, their flowering buds dark and asymmetrical, seeming to turn to watch you as you pass. The earth squirms beneath your feet, as though your very touch pains it.

You have emoted: Lin carries on for almost ten minutes as if nothing interesting has happened, but all of the sudden, she pauses, assessing the nature of her visions. Sensing a change in climate, she peels her mask back from her face - it does not scare her, there is no threat in sight - and sweeps her sight over the landscape, wild-eyed, her fogging breath obscuring her face. Experimentally, she reaches out a foot with uncharacteristic daintiness and digs the biggest talon savagely into the ground.

You push the mask up over your head, removing it.

Snow. Cold, chilling, surrounding your talon.

No. The earth gives, and the undergrowth squirms around your talon, inching away from the grievous wound you&#39;ve dealt it. Even the dirt is alive in this strange place.

You have emoted: Lin watches the results of her action with an unknowing, uncomprehending curiosity, a weak and not altogether sane laugh squeaking forth from her throat. Hope flashes in her paled face, and with a more cautious gait, she continues dead ahead, eying the potential shelter of a nearby tree or thick bush with longing but trying to ignore it. She seems greatly confused at the disobedience of her body, at the frost building up on her forearms and horns.

The forest sings and chatters around you, but the howling the snow beats at the illusion, the dream you&#39;ve fabricated; you can feel how fragile it is, how the earth shudders and gives under your footsteps. "Why are you alone?" sings the forest. "Why are you alone?"

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s song dies in her throat, her cloak shouldered heavily around her. Each step has become something of a struggle now, an uphill battle though the level of the earth is fair. Her shivering is visible, and patches of white paint her heavy covering, though to her, there is no frost, no snow, only a schism in the tundra that grows brighter and more vibrant in her eyes, willed by desperation. "D-d-don&#39;t want to be," she answers, "B-being p-p-punished... lost my- lost my t-temper..."

"Why did you lose your temper?" echoes the voice in the trees, singing through to you, resounding through the confines of your skull; the trees are blurring, shifting, CHANGING, so that every time you come close to shelter, it isn&#39;t there anymore... just a bit further, just a BIT further, drifts of snow pooling in the shadows, the greenery dying away, cracking, brown, try though you might to AVOID it. You&#39;re so COLD...

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s first stumble is nearly her last. She falters, going to her knees, catching herself and absorbing the shock in her palms. "Sssshhe t-treats me with such... s-such disrespect..." Kiyotan&#39;s broad chunk of the world throws itself back into shocking focus, and at the sight of grass becoming snow, Lin gasps, sucking in deeply chilled air. Shivering violently, she rises back to her feet, but it seems her journeys are over. "Fffffuuu- imp... her... I ca- can&#39;t stand..." Even as the myrrh steals away reality once more, she knows what she must do. She eyes the unnatural earth uncomfortably before she begins to dig a burrow into it, swiping away with both claws.

Dirt - snow - you can scarcely tell which it is - flies up around you, thrown asunder by your desperate digging. You&#39;re not cold anymore, you&#39;re warm, getting WARMER, but you find the strength to dig even so, the will to keep pressing on. The forest rises higher and higher around you, casting long shadows across your form; you&#39;ve never, EVER felt this weak, and the earth becomes heavier and heavier, but somehow, your will alone, your DETERMINATION, is enough to make your body do what it must. "Fight. Live. Win."

You have emoted: Lin finds herself repeating the words, mouthing them at first, for her jaw is too stiff to speak comfortably, but her voice picks up the thread before long, like a player setting into her instrument after gauging the rhythm. "Fight... live... win... f-fight... live... w-w-WIN..." She was born a human, not a gopher, and the burrowing is exhausting work, lasting hours, but eventually, she makes a hole deep enough that she can vanish entirely from sight if she crouches inside. With great reluctance, she slips out of her cloak and spreads it over the top in a makeshift tarpaulin, enveloping her in darkness and a relative silence. Her mostly-bare body hugged in on all sides by snow, she convulses. Nevertheless, she slips another ball of myrrh into her mouth and chews it slowly, as if to one-up her hypothermia.

You shiver away the last of your warmth bit by shuddering bit, purple flashing at the edges of your visions, moths dancing in the back of your head. Even so, surrounded by the darkness, you feel sparks dancing in your skin, replacing what was lost; somehow, it&#39;s enough to endure, enough to keep burning and flickering, even though you&#39;re imprisoned beneath the snow. "Do you believe emotion must be controlled?"

You have emoted: Lin cradles herself in her arms, her legs drawn up to her chest. Her eyes are narrow slits, the lashes fused together with ice. Her skin has turned a sort of steel grey in the coldest places, but by keeping motionless and regulating her breathing, she can slow the dropping of her core temperature, even if she cannot stop it entirely. She no longer shivers, simply breathes at a dangerously slow pace. "Wrong question... controlling emotion is like controlling heartrate, may a man die for it if they try... makes- makes no sense, choosing to live a numb life...&#39;"

"You&#39;re numb now."

You have emoted: It takes Lin several seconds to answer, her head lolling. "Just... my body. Soul is inside... soul screams, dances, wants to play in the snow... silly girl, she can be." With what proves to be monumental effort, she laughs, the sound a mere wheeze.

Just like that, the snow steals away the desire; the cold reaches in, grabs you, CHOKES you until all desire for mirth is ended. "Would you lose your temper again?"

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s body quakes suddenly, her eyes going blank as she struggles for consciousness, the myrrh&#39;s hallucinogenic effects now aided by feverish dreams and hallucinations. It is not certain where she is, but it certainly isn&#39;t here, in this pitch-black pit in the snow, her body only half-occupied, left to die. She whispers, "Yes, again, again, again... so much wrong with people... hate people, they make me so angry, always angry... c-c-can&#39;t take control of their LIVES... afraid to FEEL..."

"It makes you alone." The voice is like a needle, sharp and piercing you from nowhere. "They resent you for trying to decide for them."

You have emoted: "Ffffuck them. If I don&#39;t..." Lin mutters, "They&#39;d never... leave... comfort zone..." She takes a suddenly deep breath, her mouth opening wide as she panics, her arms wrenching away from her torso to push against the confines of her burrow. In the dark, there is an ominous rustling, and a spatter of snow hits her face. She immediately withdraws back to her previous position, her head ducked low. "N-not alone... have Mother..."

"That&#39;s not enough," the voice replies, in a sharp, high-pitched sing-song. Your hole is shifting; it&#39;s not sound.

You have emoted: Despite her efforts not to, Lin&#39;s breathing speeds up, fog drifting in quick bursts as her eyes dart up toward the hiding hole&#39;s entrance. "I don&#39;t understand, wh- what are you saying?"

"Not enough. Not enough. Not enough." The entrance gives; you feel the snow shifting again, you feel yourself falling away from it; or are you falling? Diffuclt to tell... "You need people. You need other mortals. You cannot simply be a lapdog."

You have emoted: Lin shrieks in near-silence, trying desperately to pull herself out of the hole. Her claws cannot find purchase in the softened walls of the burrow, and her strength is not sufficient to lift her own weight. Panic begins to set in again, and this time it stays, gripping her guts, making each breath a shrill gasp. "Oh, gods, You are right, I do, I do I do I do, I- I don&#39;t want to be buried here, I want to see Keshena again, and Esry and Isaac and Ingram and Caeli and their children and- and my daughter, pl-please, please... You&#39;re right, You are right..."

"Yes." Their faces swirl up before you, filling the darkness, and then suddenly you&#39;re swallowed up, falling, FALLING, through shrieking cold, through drifts of snow, the crystals cutting into you, robbing heat and strength from you, leaving you helpless, a mind trapped inside a body that simply refuses to obey; whether it&#39;s dream or reality cannot be told, but you&#39;re falling, gasping, SCREAMING through endless, devouring infinity.

"You&#39;ll never see them. Ever. Again."

You have emoted: Lin empties her lungs in her screaming, her voice giving way easily, the sound metamorphosing into a pathetic, weak snarl. Her heart, her mind, both race and surge to command her, demanding she kick, find handholds, but nothing works - her limbs have long succumbed to intense cold. It begins to dawn on her that she is imprisoned, not only in senseless snow and darkness but in her daemonic body as well, her heart pounding forcefully as if to escape it.

You know, somehow know, that your body is still where you left it; buried in snow, buried beneath a strange, hungry forest. Yet even so, you continue to fall, snow and stars streaking past you as you descend, tumbling, cold ripping into you, turning you, tossing you, buffeting you. Your vision blurs; and then you see, circling around you, dodging and diving through falling ice crystals, moths; a multitude of them, following you down, staring at you with their beady eyes.

You have emoted: Lin stares wide-eyed at the little insects, exerting all of her will and focus on them, even as she hurtles downward, even as her arms fling across her face to protect herself, she tries to keep them in her gaze, as if their glow might somehow warm her, provide her succor from her fall. Her mouth opens but no sound emerges; within her, she remains desperate and impassioned, even as she begins to lose consciousness.

You cry out in your mind, trying to drive it away from this nightmare: "I am no Speaker, I am afraid of words, I am not skilled enough with them to serve You... cut my tongue from my mouth if it please You, just please don&#39;t let me be alone!"

You land. HARD. The snow shudders around you; the dreams sparkle like broken visions in your mind&#39;s eye, but for the moment, they can offer you no further refuge. There is only the snow. The snow, and you.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s only noise is a struggling grunt. She seems aware that the configuration of her limbs is uncomfortable, but cannot even fathom what to do about such a triviality at present. She no longer comprehends where she is, how she got here, focused only on the biting, deathly cold deep in her core, and the ghostly words that continue to echo in her head. Her lips form the words, barely, "Help me..."

You have emoted: Lin rests her head against the hard-packed floor and shivers uncontrollably, the lingering effects of the myrrh swimming in her head, her oncoming fever picking up where it left off. Sleep is never kind enough to claim her, and instead she drifts in and out, never quite conscious, too persistent to die.'>You tell Kiyotan, "Kiyotan?"
Kiyotan tells you, "Lin."
You tell Kiyotan, "I am ready."
Kiyotan tells you, "Very well. I will collect you shortly."
Kiyotan enters from the west, riding a massive arctic wolf.
Kiyotan gracefully hops off of a massive arctic wolf.
She is a dexterous Yeleni. Taller than many mortal men, her shapely and muscular body follows an unnatural feral design. She appears mostly humanoid, but thin, white fur races up the length of her arms and legs, ending at just below the shoulder and upper thigh to fade into dark brown flesh. Similar fur lines her neck and jaw. Her hands are oversized, each tipped with a daggerlike black claw. Her feet are spreading, prehensile constructs of a shape seen in reptiles, the biggest toe of each terminating in a huge, curved talon. A long, whiplike tail extends from the small of her back, tipped with a brushlike tuft of fur. Her face is hidden beneath a glaring mask, a thing of bone, wood, and horn, spattered with blood. Her ears are elfin, one almost a foot long, the other missing the last few inches, as if sheared off. A pair of huge, curling black horns sprout from the dark mane that constitutes her hair, the latter of which hangs down to her rear. Her motions are unsubtly sensual, her gait a sort of quick-footed lope, and when she speaks, her voice is light with breath, muffled by the mask.
She is wearing:
fitted mithril filigree horn ornamentation
a pair of thick armwrap bracers
an oiled loincloth, laden in trinkets

Without another word, Kiyotan halts but a pace before you and pivots sideways, showing you his profile. With his feet spread apart, he reaches out to plant the heel of his palm against the forehead of your mask. His eye closes and head bows in concentration.
Kiyotan closes his eyes and begins to focus.
You have emoted: Lin heaves a percussive sigh and braces herself.
You follow Kiyotan to the ether.
The center of an infinite crossroads.
Amid an endless field of green grass, a crossroads of beaten earth divides, each leg stretching off into an unchanging horizon, static scenery as far as the eye can see. The dirt paths are razor-straight and wide enough for ten men to walk shoulder-to-shoulder. Overhead, the sky is a perpetual grey haze, forever casting these fields in wan, pale light. Standing out in stark foreignness, the very center of the crossroads's joint bears a small raised dais of white marble, upon which stands a golden throne. Wrought with elegant and meticulous care and draped with luxurious velvet, this seat bears an alien beauty, exquisite but for its bizarre and alien presence in an otherwise empty field.
Exits: north, east, south, and west.
You have emoted: Lin sways as she gets her bearings, her shoulders lowering as tension leaves them. "This is... different, not..." her thought remains unfinished, her ears pivoting backwards in a curious manner, reminiscent of your mate, as she struggles to capture all of the field in her view.

"You will be improved," Kiyotan corrects, his voice only barely audible until it, like the Yeleni, fades into the white.

You have emoted: Lin's breath flutters, though its pace is sluggish and slow - she needs her energy. Tendrils of vapor explore the front of her mask on each exhalation. A steady shiver sets in early on, the cold eager to consume her as quickly as possible, but she does not stop walking, even when it becomes obvious that the bewitched landscape will never change. Quietly, her voice a thick whisper, she sings in some seldom-heard tongue.
The landscape does change, though, even aware as you are of its sheer unrealism; ice turns to trees, white to lush greenery, and the darkness is thick around you, your shivers turning to warmth. Though quite obviously alive and well, the plants have a dark, sanguine sheen to them, their flowering buds dark and asymmetrical, seeming to turn to watch you as you pass. The earth squirms beneath your feet, as though your very touch pains it.
You have emoted: Lin carries on for almost ten minutes as if nothing interesting has happened, but all of the sudden, she pauses, assessing the nature of her visions. Sensing a change in climate, she peels her mask back from her face - it does not scare her, there is no threat in sight - and sweeps her sight over the landscape, wild-eyed, her fogging breath obscuring her face. Experimentally, she reaches out a foot with uncharacteristic daintiness and digs the biggest talon savagely into the ground.
You push the mask up over your head, removing it.
Snow. Cold, chilling, surrounding your talon.
No. The earth gives, and the undergrowth squirms around your talon, inching away from the grievous wound you've dealt it. Even the dirt is alive in this strange place.
You have emoted: Lin watches the results of her action with an unknowing, uncomprehending curiosity, a weak and not altogether sane laugh squeaking forth from her throat. Hope flashes in her paled face, and with a more cautious gait, she continues dead ahead, eying the potential shelter of a nearby tree or thick bush with longing but trying to ignore it. She seems greatly confused at the disobedience of her body, at the frost building up on her forearms and horns.
The forest sings and chatters around you, but the howling the snow beats at the illusion, the dream you've fabricated; you can feel how fragile it is, how the earth shudders and gives under your footsteps. "Why are you alone?" sings the forest. "Why are you alone?"
You have emoted: Lin's song dies in her throat, her cloak shouldered heavily around her. Each step has become something of a struggle now, an uphill battle though the level of the earth is fair. Her shivering is visible, and patches of white paint her heavy covering, though to her, there is no frost, no snow, only a schism in the tundra that grows brighter and more vibrant in her eyes, willed by desperation. "D-d-don't want to be," she answers, "B-being p-p-punished... lost my- lost my t-temper..."
"Why did you lose your temper?" echoes the voice in the trees, singing through to you, resounding through the confines of your skull; the trees are blurring, shifting, CHANGING, so that every time you come close to shelter, it isn't there anymore... just a bit further, just a BIT further, drifts of snow pooling in the shadows, the greenery dying away, cracking, brown, try though you might to AVOID it. You're so COLD...
You have emoted: Lin's first stumble is nearly her last. She falters, going to her knees, catching herself and absorbing the shock in her palms. "Sssshhe t-treats me with such... s-such disrespect..." Kiyotan's broad chunk of the world throws itself back into shocking focus, and at the sight of grass becoming snow, Lin gasps, sucking in deeply chilled air. Shivering violently, she rises back to her feet, but it seems her journeys are over. "Fffffuuu- imp... her... I ca- can't stand..." Even as the myrrh steals away reality once more, she knows what she must do. She eyes the unnatural earth uncomfortably before she begins to dig a burrow into it, swiping away with both claws.
Dirt - snow - you can scarcely tell which it is - flies up around you, thrown asunder by your desperate digging. You're not cold anymore, you're warm, getting WARMER, but you find the strength to dig even so, the will to keep pressing on. The forest rises higher and higher around you, casting long shadows across your form; you've never, EVER felt this weak, and the earth becomes heavier and heavier, but somehow, your will alone, your DETERMINATION, is enough to make your body do what it must. "Fight. Live. Win."
You have emoted: Lin finds herself repeating the words, mouthing them at first, for her jaw is too stiff to speak comfortably, but her voice picks up the thread before long, like a player setting into her instrument after gauging the rhythm. "Fight... live... win... f-fight... live... w-w-WIN..." She was born a human, not a gopher, and the burrowing is exhausting work, lasting hours, but eventually, she makes a hole deep enough that she can vanish entirely from sight if she crouches inside. With great reluctance, she slips out of her cloak and spreads it over the top in a makeshift tarpaulin, enveloping her in darkness and a relative silence. Her mostly-bare body hugged in on all sides by snow, she convulses. Nevertheless, she slips another ball of myrrh into her mouth and chews it slowly, as if to one-up her hypothermia.
You shiver away the last of your warmth bit by shuddering bit, purple flashing at the edges of your visions, moths dancing in the back of your head. Even so, surrounded by the darkness, you feel sparks dancing in your skin, replacing what was lost; somehow, it's enough to endure, enough to keep burning and flickering, even though you're imprisoned beneath the snow. "Do you believe emotion must be controlled?"
You have emoted: Lin cradles herself in her arms, her legs drawn up to her chest. Her eyes are narrow slits, the lashes fused together with ice. Her skin has turned a sort of steel grey in the coldest places, but by keeping motionless and regulating her breathing, she can slow the dropping of her core temperature, even if she cannot stop it entirely. She no longer shivers, simply breathes at a dangerously slow pace. "Wrong question... controlling emotion is like controlling heartrate, may a man die for it if they try... makes- makes no sense, choosing to live a numb life...'"
"You're numb now."
You have emoted: It takes Lin several seconds to answer, her head lolling. "Just... my body. Soul is inside... soul screams, dances, wants to play in the snow... silly girl, she can be." With what proves to be monumental effort, she laughs, the sound a mere wheeze.
Just like that, the snow steals away the desire; the cold reaches in, grabs you, CHOKES you until all desire for mirth is ended. "Would you lose your temper again?"
You have emoted: Lin's body quakes suddenly, her eyes going blank as she struggles for consciousness, the myrrh's hallucinogenic effects now aided by feverish dreams and hallucinations. It is not certain where she is, but it certainly isn't here, in this pitch-black pit in the snow, her body only half-occupied, left to die. She whispers, "Yes, again, again, again... so much wrong with people... hate people, they make me so angry, always angry... c-c-can't take control of their LIVES... afraid to FEEL..."
"It makes you alone." The voice is like a needle, sharp and piercing you from nowhere. "They resent you for trying to decide for them."
You have emoted: "Ffffuck them. If I don't..." Lin mutters, "They'd never... leave... comfort zone..." She takes a suddenly deep breath, her mouth opening wide as she panics, her arms wrenching away from her torso to push against the confines of her burrow. In the dark, there is an ominous rustling, and a spatter of snow hits her face. She immediately withdraws back to her previous position, her head ducked low. "N-not alone... have Mother..."
"That's not enough," the voice replies, in a sharp, high-pitched sing-song. Your hole is shifting; it's not sound.
You have emoted: Despite her efforts not to, Lin's breathing speeds up, fog drifting in quick bursts as her eyes dart up toward the hiding hole's entrance. "I don't understand, wh- what are you saying?"
"Not enough. Not enough. Not enough." The entrance gives; you feel the snow shifting again, you feel yourself falling away from it; or are you falling? Diffuclt to tell... "You need people. You need other mortals. You cannot simply be a lapdog."
You have emoted: Lin shrieks in near-silence, trying desperately to pull herself out of the hole. Her claws cannot find purchase in the softened walls of the burrow, and her strength is not sufficient to lift her own weight. Panic begins to set in again, and this time it stays, gripping her guts, making each breath a shrill gasp. "Oh, gods, You are right, I do, I do I do I do, I- I don't want to be buried here, I want to see Keshena again, and Esry and Isaac and Ingram and Caeli and their children and- and my daughter, pl-please, please... You're right, You are right..."
"Yes." Their faces swirl up before you, filling the darkness, and then suddenly you're swallowed up, falling, FALLING, through shrieking cold, through drifts of snow, the crystals cutting into you, robbing heat and strength from you, leaving you helpless, a mind trapped inside a body that simply refuses to obey; whether it's dream or reality cannot be told, but you're falling, gasping, SCREAMING through endless, devouring infinity.
"You'll never see them. Ever. Again."
You have emoted: Lin empties her lungs in her screaming, her voice giving way easily, the sound metamorphosing into a pathetic, weak snarl. Her heart, her mind, both race and surge to command her, demanding she kick, find handholds, but nothing works - her limbs have long succumbed to intense cold. It begins to dawn on her that she is imprisoned, not only in senseless snow and darkness but in her daemonic body as well, her heart pounding forcefully as if to escape it.
You know, somehow know, that your body is still where you left it; buried in snow, buried beneath a strange, hungry forest. Yet even so, you continue to fall, snow and stars streaking past you as you descend, tumbling, cold ripping into you, turning you, tossing you, buffeting you. Your vision blurs; and then you see, circling around you, dodging and diving through falling ice crystals, moths; a multitude of them, following you down, staring at you with their beady eyes.
You have emoted: Lin stares wide-eyed at the little insects, exerting all of her will and focus on them, even as she hurtles downward, even as her arms fling across her face to protect herself, she tries to keep them in her gaze, as if their glow might somehow warm her, provide her succor from her fall. Her mouth opens but no sound emerges; within her, she remains desperate and impassioned, even as she begins to lose consciousness.
You cry out in your mind, trying to drive it away from this nightmare: "I am no Speaker, I am afraid of words, I am not skilled enough with them to serve You... cut my tongue from my mouth if it please You, just please don't let me be alone!"
You land. HARD. The snow shudders around you; the dreams sparkle like broken visions in your mind's eye, but for the moment, they can offer you no further refuge. There is only the snow. The snow, and you.
You have emoted: Lin's only noise is a struggling grunt. She seems aware that the configuration of her limbs is uncomfortable, but cannot even fathom what to do about such a triviality at present. She no longer comprehends where she is, how she got here, focused only on the biting, deathly cold deep in her core, and the ghostly words that continue to echo in her head. Her lips form the words, barely, "Help me..."
You have emoted: Lin rests her head against the hard-packed floor and shivers uncontrollably, the lingering effects of the myrrh swimming in her head, her oncoming fever picking up where it left off. Sleep is never kind enough to claim her, and instead she drifts in and out, never quite conscious, too persistent to die.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
