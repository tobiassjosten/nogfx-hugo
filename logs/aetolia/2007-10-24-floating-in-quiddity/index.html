Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. You stand at 
The very top of the great rock, which unlike the summit of a mountain is a
relatively flat and smooth plateau which although it is not overly large 
offers no danger of falling off. From here you are afforded a magnificent view of 
the plains, which stretch out for many miles in every direction from the rock, 
and the surrounding countryside of Aetolia, perhaps one of the best views 
anywhere in the land, the forests of the north, the river Pachacacha stretching from 
east to west like a thin blue silk caught by the wind, and windings its way 
through the forests, the river Zaphar, mightiest of all the rivers. You see exits
leading southwest, west and down.

You have emoted: Tenar goes to her knees, then sprawls onto the rock, 
breathing hard.

You have emoted: Tenar rests her head on her arms, seeming to gather what 
little strength she can muster, before her efforts are scattered by a sudden 
racking fit of coughing.

You have emoted: Tenar curls into a pained ball, shaking with coughs, her 
lips and the hands she raises before them spattered with blood on each breath.

You have emoted: Tenar covers her eyes, beginning to cry softly. She drags 
her hands up to pull at her hair, smearing blood over her brow.

Bottom of pit.
A shimmering ball of energy hovers here above a multi-colored coral pedestal
ornamented with seashells. Like sharp teeth, a few stalagmites reach up from 
the ground here.
You see a single exit leading southeast.

You have emoted: Tenar tugs slowly at her hair, sitting up to rest her back
against the shrine, her elbows on her knees.

You have emoted: Tenar&#39;s lips form words, but no breath turns the shapes to
sounds. After a moment she closes her eyes, shivering.

She is a Human and is lanky and lithe.  Her skin is a comprehensive dusty 
tan, something of an ashen color underlying the ruddiness of her complexion.  Her
hair hangs just to her shoulders, an untidy flaxen tangle, which flies away
simultaneously in all directions and refuses to lie flat.  Her frame appears
attenuated to some degree--she is a bit taller than she should be, and a bit
thinner.  The bone structure in her face is sharp, a strong nose and 
slashing eyebrows, and her eyes are clear jasper-yellow.  Her coloring is tawny 
overall, and her mannerisms are those of a hunter or a beast--unselfconsciously 
sensual, immodest, unrestrained. She is wearing:
a lush circlet of glass fishes amongst leathern kelp
a pair of doeskin breeches
a grey shirt
a lynx pelt cloak
a black leather vest
a gilded butterfly

Anfini leans close into your ear. "When was the last time you saw it rain?"

You have emoted: Tenar raises her head, her face sunken and ashen pale, 
streaks of blood across her brow from just above her eyes into her hair where her 
hands now rest. "Daddy?" she whispers.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician nods, shaking shadowy dust into the 
air.

"You&#39;ve looked better, my daughter."

You have emoted: Tenar reaches out to you. "It&#39;s okay..." she whispers. "I&#39;m 
not worried about it anymore."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician caresses your hair with his slender 
hand, sniffling.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Do you fear death?"

You have emoted: Tenar holds your hand with the trembling remnant of a once
fierce grip. Her mouth trembles as she nods.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician smiles and says, "I wonder if..."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician pauses for a moment, his face calmed 
like a still pond. "I get awfully spiritual in times like these, despite my 
beliefs..."

You have emoted: Tenar tugs at your hand like a little girl, pressing it to 
her face.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician leans in close to plant a small kiss on
your forehead, his lips like ice.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "You&#39;ve changed me for the 
better, baby. I feel like a ghost, sometimes."

You have emoted: Tenar clears her throat, licking blood from her lips. 
"You&#39;re gonna get sick, Daddy. You shouldn&#39;t be here."

Crystal tears slide down Anfini&#39;s face, displacing the shadowy material that
coats his form.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "What are you thinking about, 
Tenar?"

You say, "Mom."

Anfini exhales slowly, allowing a long fluid breath to creep from his lungs.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I wish she was here right 
now..."

You have emoted: Tenar shakes her head. "I tried to find her, but...it&#39;s 
hard to walk so far."

You say, "She wasn&#39;t at the river."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician shakes his head and wipes his hand 
across your brow.

You have emoted: Tenar coughs convulsively, her hand flying to cover her 
mouth.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Don&#39;t. She probably can&#39;t take
this."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "It&#39;s best for... all of us if 
she&#39;s by herself right now."

You say, "She wouldn&#39;t know what to do..."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician smiles sadly, heaving a great sigh. 
"No, she&#39;d... she&#39;d think you just had a bad stomach ache, or a bad cough... 
she&#39;d go off to pick you berries because those make her feel better."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician shakes suddenly, choking down the urge 
to cry.

You have emoted: Tenar tugs at your hand again, suddenly looking stricken.
"Daddy, I&#39;m sorry I ran away. I was scared, I...when Rion--".

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I won&#39;t do that to you. She
needed... help, I guess."

You say, "I know, I just thought...I didn&#39;t know what you were going to do,
but...I should have trusted you."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "P-please do."

Anfini embraces you with great ardour.

Ghostlike smoke oozes off of Anfini as he squeezes you tight, the effect 
like being immersed in a cool steam bath.

You have emoted: Tenar clings to you, shivering. "I do, Daddy, I do. I&#39;m 
sorry, if I hadn&#39;t been s-so stupid, maybe--" She begins to cry, punctuated by
occasional coughs.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician clings to you cheek-to-cheek, his 
breath coming out in great shuddering heaves. "If they had told me I would have to
watch my daughter die, I might... I might have never bothered..."

Ravek arrives from the southeast.

Ravek eyes you suspiciously.

Ravek peers about himself suspiciously.

You have emoted: Tenar shivers, coughing hard.

Ravek Orises, Devi wo Vusba ti says, "Who else is here..."

You have emoted: Tenar turns her face away from the newcomer.

A shadowy form lies over Tenar, embracing her. A deep voice emanates from 
his figure. "Please leave."

Ravek Orises, Devi wo Vusba ti ponders the girl&#39;s shrouded figure a moment
before turning to go...

Ravek Orises, Devi wo Vusba ti says, "Another time, Anfini."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Another time."

Ravek Orises, Devi wo Vusba ti raises his hand in farewell.

Ravek leaves to the southeast.

Anfini raises his hands dramatically, and summons an icewall to the 
southeast.

You have emoted: Tenar squeezes your hand. "What do you mean, not bothered?"

Anfini reaches out and gently caresses you.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "You never got to live long 
enough to really make something of yourself..."

You have emoted: Tenar rasps, "Do you believe that?"

Anfini stares implacably at you.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician sadly says, "Well... it&#39;s just that..."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician glances sidelong at the wall for a 
moment, caught in thought.

You have emoted: Tenar closes her eyes, her face wracked with silent 
suffering. "Daddy, sometimes things happen. Kids fall in lakes, carts roll over babies,
young men get shot in hunting--" she explodes into coughs, then continues 
when she gets her breath - "Hunting parties."

You have emoted: Tenar whispers, "It doesn&#39;t mean anything. It&#39;s just 
chance.  Bad chance."

You say, "The gods don&#39;t have anything to do with it. It&#39;s just a...roll of 
the dice."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician grips your shoulders like a crazed 
demon, yelling "I REFUSE to leave your life to chance!"

You have emoted: Tenar trembles under your hands, her head rolling back a
little, weakly. "Just by living...we&#39;re all given up to chance."

You say, "You could keep me in a cage, feed me every day... that might keep 
me safe."

You say, "But maybe not. Maybe there would be a diseased mosquito come along
some day."

You have emoted: Tenar reaches up to touch your face. "Living means 
accepting that you might die, and letting that be unimportant enough to keep living."

As if by contact, Anfini shudders and breaks into tears again, smoke rolling 
off of his cheeks as they slide down his face.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I&#39;m s-sorry, Tenar... I thought 
I&#39;d hold up better..."

You have emoted: Tenar leans closer so that she can rest her head in the 
crook of your shoulder. "You&#39;ve been a good father."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician wipes his nose off with his sleeve. 
"Before I got here I had to... had to..." he stops for a moment to let out a shaky
breath. "Have I really? I never see you..."

You have emoted: Tenar breathes out gently, a voiceless laugh. "That might 
be part of what makes you a good father, considering...what I&#39;ve heard about 
the people you see a lot of."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Shelter. I&#39;ve tried to keep you 
out of my business..."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Splash me with blood, but I 
didn&#39;t want to see you like me."

You have emoted: Tenar nods slowly against your shoulder. "You&#39;ve done that
much. And I thank you for it."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I&#39;m just... not a good person,
Tenar."

You say, "I don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t care what you do or what you&#39;ve done or what
comes home in your pockets..."

You cough softly.

Anfini gives you a hard squeeze.

You say, "You&#39;re my dad."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician whispers into your ear, "I think you 
came out beautiful."

You have emoted: Tenar smiles ruefully. "Maybe..." she whispers. "Rion was
right."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "About what...?"

You say, "She told me...you do good work, beautiful work, with a scalpel. 
She used to say, someday when someone gives that man a different tool to work 
with, he&#39;ll make art that&#39;ll take his own breath away."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician wipes the excess moisture from his face
hurriedly, sniffling all the while. "When did she say that?"

You say, "When we took that trip together, into the mountains...a few months
before she died."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician grips your hand in his own, marveling 
at the similarity.

You say, "Daddy, don&#39;t get sick. And don&#39;t waste away wishing my life had 
been something different."

You have emoted: Tenar coughs harshly.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician shakes his head hurriedly.

You say, "That&#39;s supposed to be my job."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "No, never! Honey, your father 
spends enough time anguishing instead of changing things."

You say, "Just...take care of Mom. I don&#39;t know what she&#39;ll do if I&#39;m gone. 
She might not..."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician skims his hand over your hair.

You crease your brow in a frown.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Sh-she&#39;ll be fine... she will."

You say, "She might not understand. If she does, she might not do so well."

You have emoted: Tenar whispers, "We haven&#39;t been so good to her, not me 
either.  You have to take better care of her."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician sniffles loudly and nods. "I will. Of
course I will."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "My dear, I will see to it that 
you will never really die... I promise you that."

You have emoted: Tenar curls closer to you, resting her head in your lap.
"Well...just don&#39;t give me to that vampire, okay? I don&#39;t...don&#39;t want 
that."

You have emoted: Tenar&#39;s words begin to slur somewhat, and her shivers have
stopped entirely.

Anfini&#39;s breath catches in a gasp of surprise.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician&#39;s voice comes out in a frenzied shriek.
"No! Not like this! Not so quick!"

You have emoted: Tenar frowns. "Don&#39;t yell, Daddy. I&#39;m just resting..."

You have emoted: Tenar murmurs, "Promise you won&#39;t give me to your vampire."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician gasps again, squeezing you in a 
death-grip, hands shaking violently. "I won&#39;t, I won&#39;t."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Do you know what I&#39;ll do with 
your body?"

You shake your head.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "There&#39;s..."

Anfini sniffles softly.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "There&#39;s this garden, in Kelsys,
my... my sort-of-home. During the daylight hours a solid stream of light 
filters right through the water and onto this patch of grass, right off the 
center..."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "G-get my drift?"

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician smiles weakly at you.

You have emoted: Tenar nods. "That&#39;s good. It doesn&#39;t much matter...just 
flesh."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I don&#39;t ritualize death. It 
would mean a lot to me."

You say, "I&#39;ll be in th&#39; Underhalls then...hope it&#39;ss warm there."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician grips your hands in his own, staring
helplessly at you.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I love you..."

You have emoted: Tenar returns your grip weakly. "I love you too, Daddy. 
Don&#39;t go. It&#39;s...cold when you&#39;re not here."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician nods at you in slow-motion.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician scoops you up in his arms, gathering 
you close to him.

You have emoted: Tenar closes her eyes and leans her head against your 
chest.  "Don&#39;t go..." she murmurs again.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician whispers close into your ear, his lips
brushing the surface of you skin. "I&#39;m not going anywhere, baby..."

You have emoted: Tenar nods, a soft, almost watery sound accompanying each
breath.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician caresses your hair gently as he pitches 
his head back and begins to hum something to himself, a low-pitched, longing 
song that carries itself with a haunting echo through the cavernous room.

You have emoted: Tenar&#39;s breaths slow as she seems to fall asleep, but after 
a long time she whispers again.

You have emoted: Tenar whispers, "Daddy...don&#39;t be afraid."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I&#39;m not..."

You have emoted: Tenar&#39;s lips shape the words again, repeatedly, but no 
breath gives the shapes sound. After a time, she drifts back into sleep again.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician mutters, ". .ove you..."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician remains sitting with the girl in his 
lap, his hair fallen over his hung head.

You have emoted: Tenar&#39;s breath remains steady, though labored, for a while,
before falling off, a slow decline.

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I&#39;ll fill galleries with 
paintings of you... gardens with statues."

Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Get some rest, my girl... you&#39;ve
earned it."

Anfini sniffles softly.'>Atop the great rock.
Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. You stand at
The very top of the great rock, which unlike the summit of a mountain is a
relatively flat and smooth plateau which although it is not overly large
offers no danger of falling off. From here you are afforded a magnificent view of
the plains, which stretch out for many miles in every direction from the rock,
and the surrounding countryside of Aetolia, perhaps one of the best views
anywhere in the land, the forests of the north, the river Pachacacha stretching from
east to west like a thin blue silk caught by the wind, and windings its way
through the forests, the river Zaphar, mightiest of all the rivers. You see exits
leading southwest, west and down.
You have emoted: Tenar goes to her knees, then sprawls onto the rock,
breathing hard.
You have emoted: Tenar rests her head on her arms, seeming to gather what
little strength she can muster, before her efforts are scattered by a sudden

You have emoted: Tenar shivers, coughing hard.
Ravek Orises, Devi wo Vusba ti says, "Who else is here..."
You have emoted: Tenar turns her face away from the newcomer.
A shadowy form lies over Tenar, embracing her. A deep voice emanates from
his figure. "Please leave."
Ravek Orises, Devi wo Vusba ti ponders the girl's shrouded figure a moment
before turning to go...
Ravek Orises, Devi wo Vusba ti says, "Another time, Anfini."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Another time."
Ravek Orises, Devi wo Vusba ti raises his hand in farewell.
Ravek leaves to the southeast.
Anfini raises his hands dramatically, and summons an icewall to the
southeast.
You have emoted: Tenar squeezes your hand. "What do you mean, not bothered?"
Anfini reaches out and gently caresses you.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "You never got to live long
enough to really make something of yourself..."
You have emoted: Tenar rasps, "Do you believe that?"
Anfini stares implacably at you.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician sadly says, "Well... it's just that..."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician glances sidelong at the wall for a
moment, caught in thought.
You have emoted: Tenar closes her eyes, her face wracked with silent
suffering. "Daddy, sometimes things happen. Kids fall in lakes, carts roll over babies,
young men get shot in hunting--" she explodes into coughs, then continues
when she gets her breath - "Hunting parties."
You have emoted: Tenar whispers, "It doesn't mean anything. It's just
chance. Bad chance."
You say, "The gods don't have anything to do with it. It's just a...roll of
the dice."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician grips your shoulders like a crazed
demon, yelling "I REFUSE to leave your life to chance!"
You have emoted: Tenar trembles under your hands, her head rolling back a
little, weakly. "Just by living...we're all given up to chance."
You say, "You could keep me in a cage, feed me every day... that might keep
me safe."
You say, "But maybe not. Maybe there would be a diseased mosquito come along
some day."
You have emoted: Tenar reaches up to touch your face. "Living means
accepting that you might die, and letting that be unimportant enough to keep living."
As if by contact, Anfini shudders and breaks into tears again, smoke rolling
off of his cheeks as they slide down his face.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I'm s-sorry, Tenar... I thought
I'd hold up better..."
You have emoted: Tenar leans closer so that she can rest her head in the
crook of your shoulder. "You've been a good father."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician wipes his nose off with his sleeve.
"Before I got here I had to... had to..." he stops for a moment to let out a shaky
breath. "Have I really? I never see you..."
You have emoted: Tenar breathes out gently, a voiceless laugh. "That might
be part of what makes you a good father, considering...what I've heard about
the people you see a lot of."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Shelter. I've tried to keep you
out of my business..."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Splash me with blood, but I
didn't want to see you like me."
You have emoted: Tenar nods slowly against your shoulder. "You've done that
much. And I thank you for it."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I'm just... not a good person,
Tenar."
You say, "I don't care. I don't care what you do or what you've done or what
comes home in your pockets..."
You cough softly.
Anfini gives you a hard squeeze.
You say, "You're my dad."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician whispers into your ear, "I think you
came out beautiful."
You have emoted: Tenar smiles ruefully. "Maybe..." she whispers. "Rion was
right."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "About what...?"
You say, "She told me...you do good work, beautiful work, with a scalpel.
She used to say, someday when someone gives that man a different tool to work
with, he'll make art that'll take his own breath away."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician wipes the excess moisture from his face
hurriedly, sniffling all the while. "When did she say that?"
You say, "When we took that trip together, into the mountains...a few months
before she died."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician grips your hand in his own, marveling
at the similarity.
You say, "Daddy, don't get sick. And don't waste away wishing my life had
been something different."
You have emoted: Tenar coughs harshly.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician shakes his head hurriedly.
You say, "That's supposed to be my job."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "No, never! Honey, your father
spends enough time anguishing instead of changing things."
You say, "Just...take care of Mom. I don't know what she'll do if I'm gone.
She might not..."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician skims his hand over your hair.
You crease your brow in a frown.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Sh-she'll be fine... she will."
You say, "She might not understand. If she does, she might not do so well."
You have emoted: Tenar whispers, "We haven't been so good to her, not me
either. You have to take better care of her."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician sniffles loudly and nods. "I will. Of
course I will."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "My dear, I will see to it that
you will never really die... I promise you that."
You have emoted: Tenar curls closer to you, resting her head in your lap.
"Well...just don't give me to that vampire, okay? I don't...don't want
that."
You have emoted: Tenar's words begin to slur somewhat, and her shivers have
stopped entirely.
Anfini's breath catches in a gasp of surprise.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician's voice comes out in a frenzied shriek.
"No! Not like this! Not so quick!"
You have emoted: Tenar frowns. "Don't yell, Daddy. I'm just resting..."
You have emoted: Tenar murmurs, "Promise you won't give me to your vampire."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician gasps again, squeezing you in a
death-grip, hands shaking violently. "I won't, I won't."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Do you know what I'll do with
your body?"
You shake your head.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "There's..."
Anfini sniffles softly.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "There's this garden, in Kelsys,
my... my sort-of-home. During the daylight hours a solid stream of light
filters right through the water and onto this patch of grass, right off the
center..."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "G-get my drift?"
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician smiles weakly at you.
You have emoted: Tenar nods. "That's good. It doesn't much matter...just
flesh."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I don't ritualize death. It
would mean a lot to me."
You say, "I'll be in th' Underhalls then...hope it'ss warm there."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician grips your hands in his own, staring
helplessly at you.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I love you..."
You have emoted: Tenar returns your grip weakly. "I love you too, Daddy.
Don't go. It's...cold when you're not here."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician nods at you in slow-motion.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician scoops you up in his arms, gathering
you close to him.
You have emoted: Tenar closes her eyes and leans her head against your
chest. "Don't go..." she murmurs again.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician whispers close into your ear, his lips
brushing the surface of you skin. "I'm not going anywhere, baby..."
You have emoted: Tenar nods, a soft, almost watery sound accompanying each
breath.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician caresses your hair gently as he pitches
his head back and begins to hum something to himself, a low-pitched, longing
song that carries itself with a haunting echo through the cavernous room.
You have emoted: Tenar's breaths slow as she seems to fall asleep, but after
a long time she whispers again.
You have emoted: Tenar whispers, "Daddy...don't be afraid."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I'm not..."
You have emoted: Tenar's lips shape the words again, repeatedly, but no
breath gives the shapes sound. After a time, she drifts back into sleep again.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician mutters, ". .ove you..."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician remains sitting with the girl in his
lap, his hair fallen over his hung head.
You have emoted: Tenar's breath remains steady, though labored, for a while,
before falling off, a slow decline.
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "I'll fill galleries with
paintings of you... gardens with statues."
Dr. Anfini, the Ample Soul Physician says, "Get some rest, my girl... you've
earned it."
Anfini sniffles softly.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
