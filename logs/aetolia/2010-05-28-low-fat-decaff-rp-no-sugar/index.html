You have entered a cavern as strange as any sight you have yet to behold. Inside this stone room are literally dozens of carved troughs lining the walls. The troughs are filled to overflowing with all manner of leafy green vegetation gathered presumably from the surface. Occupying the troughs are dozens of huge aphids, each a pasty white color, slowly sucking the juices from the plants. Workers scurry about busily, carrying pots of fired clay. As you watch in amazement a worker gently strokes an aphid with its antennae, and is rewarded with a shining bead of amber liquid. The worker chirrups in glee and scurries off with its treasure.  Proselyte Carlyle Lunare is here, shrouded.
You see a single exit leading north.

ex Carlyle
He is a clever Atavian vampire. Tall and narrow in face and body, grey eyes peering down over a sharp nose. Full brown hair, auburn highlighted, neatly trimmed just past shoulder length. Wings to bear him heavenwards, fangs to pierce the unwary. He is wearing:
a chic pair of midnight-black trousers
a crimson shirt
a simple black vest with elongated tails
a pair of tall black boots
a white lace ascot scarf
He walks with the blessing of Ysmali.

look me
He is an agile Rajamala with a lean, humanoid physique, five feet and seven inches in height when standing upright. Short, dirty orange fur coats his body with innumerable thin black stripes that coalesce into black patches around his joints. His tiger-like head is wide and several white whiskers grow beneath the grey nose at the end of his blunt muzzle. He has large orange eyes with slitted black pupils and the tips of two large upper canine teeth poke out from beneath his upper lip. Jointed as a quadruped, he stands with the majority of his weight on his toes in a somewhat crouched stance; his hands are structured as a human&#39;s but each digit is tipped with a retractable claw and the palms and fingertips have calloused black pads. A stocky, furry tail sprouts from the base of his tailbone and swishes with every movement. He is wearing:
2 simple ring of heatherwoods
a plain grey pack
a shadowy cloak
a dark, nondescript hood
a pair of shadowy leather trousers
a pair of shadowy assassin&#39;s boots
a dashing highwayman&#39;s mask
a sleek, black quiver
a darkbow

You eye Carlyle, giving him the once over.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Hello?"

You indifferently say, "Hi."

Carlyle looks around in confusion.

You raise an eyebrow at Carlyle.

You say to Carlyle, "Something the matter?"

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I hear you, but I do not see you.."

You see the following people here:
Carlyle, Seurimas

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "But no.. nothing is the matter, persay."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Except perhaps with my eyes."

You say to Carlyle, "Ah, I figured you vampires had keener senses."

You say, "Suppose I was wrong."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Well, I can&#39;t really speak for vampires.. I&#39;m just a nightstalker."

conjure illusion carlyle A subtle movement amongst the shadows catches your eye at the corner of your vision.
You conjure up your illusion.

You say, "To-may-to, to-mah-to."

You smile wryly.

Carlyle utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I suppose the difference might seem meaningless to outsiders."


You say, "Meaningless is an all right word for it. Personally, I&#39;d use &#39;boring&#39; though."

Turning your snout to the wind, you deeply inhale any scents from the air.
        Carlyle is at Honeydew Caverns. (1823) (Ulangi.)
Balance Used: 2.25 seconds

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Like many things, it seem disproportianately important when you are striving for it."

You ponder Carlyle&#39;s profile, deep in consideration.

You say to Carlyle, "I suppose you&#39;re of the younger sort then, striving as you are for your sirring of whatever it is?"

Carlyle nods his head emphatically.

You say to Carlyle, "You happen to understand lifevision yet or not?"

Carlyle raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "No, not yet."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Oh wait.."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I do."

Carlyle narrows his eyes and then blinks rapidly, several times.

You say, "Those are those keen senses I expected."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Aha! Now I see you."

You smile impishly and say, "You see me for now."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Oh?"

You say, "Which is to say you shouldn&#39;t expect that always to be the case."

You say, "No senses are quite keen enough to find me always. At least no vampire&#39;s senses."

Carlyle seems to think for a moment before nodding slowly.

Almost entirely to himself, you say, "At least last I checked. Seems I&#39;m making mistakes as to how invisible I think I am quite often lately."

Your ghostly image slowly intensifies until you appear flesh and blood again.

You project a net of light about yourself until your image becomes faded and ghostly.

Carlyle peer at you.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I can still see you.."

You look confused and say, "Indeed you can."

You say, "Were you expecting something different?"

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I noticed you fade a bit?"

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I was responding to that."

Carlyle shrugs helplessly.

You say, "Can&#39;t stay ghostly and cloaked indefinitely. I faded back into visibility then returned my veil to its place shortly after."

Carlyle smiles and says "but many things I take note of seem to be irrelevant to those more.. accustomed to the way of things.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Ah."

You say, "&#39;s how it works usually. Besides a handful of people who seemingly got their schooling before adulthood."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Lucky ones, I suppose."

Nodding in agreement, you say, "I suppose so."



You smile wryly.

You toss a sparkling cloud of dust over Carlyle, who vanishes into invisibility as it settles over him.

Carlyle utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "So where do you learn tricks like that?"

You say, "Spinesreach, mostly."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Forthcoming."

You ponder the situation.

You say, "Hm?"

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "That was a rather vague answer."

You smile wryly.

You say, "It was a specific an answer as there is. Ashayth in the library taught me much of all I know."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "What I meant though, was what guild teaches those skills."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Though I see how you might have been confused.."

Carlyle coughs politely.

You say, "Syssin then."

The corners of Carlyle&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Thanks."

You ponder Carlyle&#39;s profile, deep in consideration.

You say, "Huh, can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had a civil conversation with a vampire before. Unless he was asking for someone killed."

You say to Carlyle, "So, do you drink blood yet?"

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I think I can. Though I haven&#39;t."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "And I always appreciate civil conversations."

You frown and say, "Doesn&#39;t not drinking blood tend to end poorly? Say with lots of feral rage and all that?"

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Though strictly speaking, I may be violating some sort of rule."

Carlyle shrugs helplessly.

Carlyle looks over himself.

You say, "Doubt you&#39;re breaking anything. It&#39;s Bloodloch, not Enorian."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I don&#39;t seem enraged... perhaps thats a vampire thing.. not Nightstalkers."

You say, "Seems so."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "If you were a house enemy I know I would be."

You say, "If I were an enemy I&#39;d likely be having a great deal of fun with your husk. Or what would soon be your husk. Or at the very least with some ropes and your semi-conscious body."

Carlyle utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

You pat a length of rope in a friendly manner.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Certainly, though I&#39;m not sure how much fun my husks can provide."

Apparently taking a moment to appraise the possibilities, you say, "With a little creativity, quite a lot."

You smile wryly.

Carlyle&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

You say, "But you&#39;re safe, don&#39;t worry."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I&#39;m not all that worried.. death happens."

Carlyle shrugs nonchalantly.

You smile wryly.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Its a "learning experience"."

The corners of Carlyle&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

You say, "Perhaps you&#39;re not aware of the Syssin&#39;s favorite passtime. The first time, there wouldn&#39;t be death."

Nodding in agreement, you say, "Sometimes a very _long_ learning experience."

Carlyle raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Well.. afterwards I would be aware?"

Carlyle looks worried and curious.

You say, "Hm?"

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Just wondering what this pasttime is.. something involving poison I assume."

With a grin and very pointedly, you say, "Nothing lethal."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "If it were lethal, it wouldn&#39;t really be all that long, I&#39;m guessing."

You say, "That&#39;s the point, yes."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Sounds unpleasant."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Good thing its a civil conversation."

You say, "It&#39;s actually quite fun, but I suppose the difference depends on where you are in the situation."

You nod your head at Carlyle.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Maybe not entirely.. There are always masochists."

You smile and say, "I guess in those situations everyone&#39;s happy!"

Carlyle gestures at your whip pointedly.

The corners of Carlyle&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

You pat an iron-tipped whip in a friendly manner.

ii cup
You are wielding:
You are holding:
"cup96044"               an ornate iron goblet (a slippery shot of "the Thief").
You are wearing:
You are holding 1 items.

probe cup
Iron has been shaped and twisted into a delicate cup, swooping upwards to form a stemmed goblet. Fashioned in the shape of an unfurling rose, the blossom opens into a wide mouth, shaping the bowl of the cup, while a slender, barbed vine twines downwards to the glass&#39; base. Carefully molded, the tankard features intricate chiseling, with engraved lines tracing the veins of the flower and each curve of the bloom&#39;s thorns.
It has 167 months of usefulness left.
It is strangely weightless.
It bears the distinctive mark of Moirean Seirath, Huntress of the Wilds.
A slippery shot of "the Thief" sloshes about in it. (9 sips)

You have emoted: Seurimas idly pulls at his shadowy cloak for a moment before looking back at Carlyle.

You say to Carlyle, "Hey, do you like alcohol?"

Carlyle utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I do, but novice laws in my guild forbid it."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I mean house.."

Glaring a goblet in his hands, you say, "Bah, this stuff probably wouldn&#39;t even get you drunk. I think it was joke of some sort..."

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Well in that case..."

You secretly slip an ornate iron goblet into the inventory of Proselyte Carlyle Lunare.

You have emoted: Seurimas hands the cup to Carlyle, watching closely for his reaction when he drinks.

Carlyle takes a slow sip of his drink, frowning, as if in dismay, at the result.

Carlyle raises an eyebrow questioningly.

You smile wryly at Carlyle.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Tastes like water.."

You say, "Thank you! I thought my senses had dulled or something."

Carlyle shakes.

Carlyle shakes his head.

You say, "I think the brewer was trying to send a message. One I didn&#39;t quite get it seems."

You shrug helplessly.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I prefer brewers to send more debilitating messages."

You utter a deep, rumbling laugh.

Carlyle gives an ornate iron goblet to you.

You say, "Perhaps when you&#39;ve become sirred we could get a proper drink."

Carlyle nods his head emphatically.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Definitely."

You express your esteem of Carlyle for Can&#39;t knock a good civil conversation.

You say, "For now, I must be going."

You smirk and say, "Want a parting shroud?"

Carlyle has expressed his esteem of you for the following reason: Longest IC conversation I&#39;ve had yet. Definitely appreciate it when people who have no obligation (guild/city/house) go out of their way to rp.

Carlyle nods his head emphatically.

You toss a sparkling cloud of dust over Carlyle, who vanishes into invisibility as it settles over him.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Can&#39;t hurt.. maybe I can sneak up on some nightstalkers who don&#39;t use lifevision."

You smirk and say to Carlyle, "And now you can pretend to be half as sneaky as I am."

Carlyle utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

You say, "Catch me when you want that drink then. Farewell."

Carlyle nods his head emphatically.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Farewell."

You grow still and begin to silently pray for preservation of your soul while you are out of the land.

Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Though strictly speaking, I may be violating some sort of rule."
Carlyle shrugs helplessly.
Carlyle looks over himself.
You say, "Doubt you're breaking anything. It's Bloodloch, not Enorian."
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I don't seem enraged... perhaps thats a vampire thing.. not Nightstalkers."
You say, "Seems so."
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "If you were a house enemy I know I would be."
You say, "If I were an enemy I'd likely be having a great deal of fun with your husk. Or what would soon be your husk. Or at the very least with some ropes and your semi-conscious body."
Carlyle utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
You pat a length of rope in a friendly manner.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Certainly, though I'm not sure how much fun my husks can provide."
Apparently taking a moment to appraise the possibilities, you say, "With a little creativity, quite a lot."
You smile wryly.
Carlyle's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
You say, "But you're safe, don't worry."
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I'm not all that worried.. death happens."
Carlyle shrugs nonchalantly.
You smile wryly.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Its a "learning experience"."
The corners of Carlyle's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
You say, "Perhaps you're not aware of the Syssin's favorite passtime. The first time, there wouldn't be death."
Nodding in agreement, you say, "Sometimes a very _long_ learning experience."
Carlyle raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Well.. afterwards I would be aware?"
Carlyle looks worried and curious.
You say, "Hm?"
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Just wondering what this pasttime is.. something involving poison I assume."
With a grin and very pointedly, you say, "Nothing lethal."
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "If it were lethal, it wouldn't really be all that long, I'm guessing."
You say, "That's the point, yes."
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Sounds unpleasant."
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Good thing its a civil conversation."
You say, "It's actually quite fun, but I suppose the difference depends on where you are in the situation."
You nod your head at Carlyle.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Maybe not entirely.. There are always masochists."
You smile and say, "I guess in those situations everyone's happy!"
Carlyle gestures at your whip pointedly.
The corners of Carlyle's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
You pat an iron-tipped whip in a friendly manner.
ii cup
You are wielding:
You are holding:
"cup96044" an ornate iron goblet (a slippery shot of "the Thief").
You are wearing:
You are holding 1 items.
probe cup
Iron has been shaped and twisted into a delicate cup, swooping upwards to form a stemmed goblet. Fashioned in the shape of an unfurling rose, the blossom opens into a wide mouth, shaping the bowl of the cup, while a slender, barbed vine twines downwards to the glass' base. Carefully molded, the tankard features intricate chiseling, with engraved lines tracing the veins of the flower and each curve of the bloom's thorns.
It has 167 months of usefulness left.
It is strangely weightless.
It bears the distinctive mark of Moirean Seirath, Huntress of the Wilds.
A slippery shot of "the Thief" sloshes about in it. (9 sips)
You have emoted: Seurimas idly pulls at his shadowy cloak for a moment before looking back at Carlyle.
You say to Carlyle, "Hey, do you like alcohol?"
Carlyle utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I do, but novice laws in my guild forbid it."
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I mean house.."
Glaring a goblet in his hands, you say, "Bah, this stuff probably wouldn't even get you drunk. I think it was joke of some sort..."
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Well in that case..."
You secretly slip an ornate iron goblet into the inventory of Proselyte Carlyle Lunare.
You have emoted: Seurimas hands the cup to Carlyle, watching closely for his reaction when he drinks.
Carlyle takes a slow sip of his drink, frowning, as if in dismay, at the result.
Carlyle raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You smile wryly at Carlyle.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Tastes like water.."
You say, "Thank you! I thought my senses had dulled or something."
Carlyle shakes.
Carlyle shakes his head.
You say, "I think the brewer was trying to send a message. One I didn't quite get it seems."
You shrug helplessly.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "I prefer brewers to send more debilitating messages."
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh.
Carlyle gives an ornate iron goblet to you.
You say, "Perhaps when you've become sirred we could get a proper drink."
Carlyle nods his head emphatically.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Definitely."
You express your esteem of Carlyle for Can't knock a good civil conversation.
You say, "For now, I must be going."
You smirk and say, "Want a parting shroud?"
Carlyle has expressed his esteem of you for the following reason: Longest IC conversation I've had yet. Definitely appreciate it when people who have no obligation (guild/city/house) go out of their way to rp.
Carlyle nods his head emphatically.
You toss a sparkling cloud of dust over Carlyle, who vanishes into invisibility as it settles over him.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Can't hurt.. maybe I can sneak up on some nightstalkers who don't use lifevision."
You smirk and say to Carlyle, "And now you can pretend to be half as sneaky as I am."
Carlyle utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
You say, "Catch me when you want that drink then. Farewell."
Carlyle nods his head emphatically.
Proselyte Carlyle Lunare says, "Farewell."
You grow still and begin to silently pray for preservation of your soul while you are out of the land.
