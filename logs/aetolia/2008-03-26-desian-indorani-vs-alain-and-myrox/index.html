He is an undead pale Azudim and is a foreboding figure, the entirety of his eleven foot frame shrouded in coalescing shadow. Midnight black skin is stretched taut over thick, corded muscles, heightening his imposing appearance. His features are stoic, a firm jaw set below stout cheekbones. The whites of his eyes contrast heavily with his dark skin, giving them a frighteningly wide look when open. Blue lips rest under flared nostrils, nearly blending with the colored skin. Thick, dreadlocked black hair is splayed across his face, obscuring where it falls. Pulsing slightly, veined wings display their bat-like presence at his back in a somber blue tone. A golden hourglass is burned into his torso, glowing dimly with the essence of death. He is wearing:
a ring of pestilence
a medallion of the Chosen
a silver ring
an auroral sunstone ring
a plain leather weaponbelt
3 obsidian ring, set with silvers
a pack embroidered with a golden hourglass

He is an undead pale Azudim and is a foreboding figure, the entirety of his eleven foot frame shrouded in coalescing shadow. Midnight black skin is stretched taut over thick, corded muscles, heightening his imposing appearance. His features are stoic, a firm jaw set below stout cheekbones. The whites of his eyes contrast heavily with his dark skin, giving them a frighteningly wide look when open. Blue lips rest under flared nostrils, nearly blending with the colored skin. Thick, dreadlocked black hair is splayed across his face, obscuring where it falls. Pulsing slightly, veined wings display their bat-like presence at his back in a somber blue tone. A golden hourglass is burned into his torso, glowing dimly with the essence of death. He is wearing:
a ring of pestilence
a medallion of the Chosen
a silver ring

a plain leather weaponbelt
3 obsidian ring, set with silvers

An almost unbearable feeling of emptiness heralds the arrival of a cloaked and hooded figure carrying a blood-stained sickle. Alain gasps in terror as a skeletal hand emerges from the sleeve and points at him. He bows his head to the inevitable as the manifestation of Death swings its sickle at his neck. You watch in fascinated horror as his head is severed from his body.
