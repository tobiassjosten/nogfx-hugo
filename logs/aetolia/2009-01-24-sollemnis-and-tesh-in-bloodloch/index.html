[12:39.57]Flowing from a natural spring deep within the earth, this river still pulses with a strong current. Coming from the east, the water moves quickly westward. The cavern narrows as the water runs along its course, clearly illustrating that these tunnels were carved by the natural path of the river. Also obvious, by the faint marking on the walls, is that the water level has been slowly dropping over the years. Duke Tesh Voltaire is here, hidden. You see exits leading north, southeast and west.

[12:39.57]Flowing from a natural spring deep within the earth, this river still pulses with a strong current. Coming from the east, the water moves quickly westward. The cavern narrows as the water runs along its course, clearly illustrating that these tunnels were carved by the natural path of the river. Also obvious, by the faint marking on the walls, is that the water level has been slowly dropping over the years. Duke Tesh Voltaire is here, hidden. You see exits leading north, southeast and west.
