--- A cobblestone walkway -------- -4:1:0 ---
Slate grey cobblestone peppers the ground to form a crude walkway out of the forest visible to the east. Small green grasses and weeds have found their home within the cracks of the stones, though they are trodden in a few places. A dusting of sand veils the cobblestone, deposited from the heavy foot traffic in the area. The laughter of the nearby brook, encompassed with the shrill cry of distant birds, creates an aura of solitude. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.
You see exits leading east and southwest.

--- A cobblestone walkway -------- -4:1:0 ---
Slate grey cobblestone peppers the ground to form a crude walkway out of the forest visible to the east. Small green grasses and weeds have found their home within the cracks of the stones, though they are trodden in a few places. A dusting of sand veils the cobblestone, deposited from the heavy foot traffic in the area. The laughter of the nearby brook, encompassed with the shrill cry of distant birds, creates an aura of solitude. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.
You see exits leading east and southwest.

--- A cobblestone walkway -------- -4:1:0 ---
Slate grey cobblestone peppers the ground to form a crude walkway out of the forest visible to the east. Small green grasses and weeds have found their home within the cracks of the stones, though they are trodden in a few places. A dusting of sand veils the cobblestone, deposited from the heavy foot traffic in the area. The laughter of the nearby brook, encompassed with the shrill cry of distant birds, creates an aura of solitude. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.

--- A cobblestone walkway -------- -4:1:0 ---
Slate grey cobblestone peppers the ground to form a crude walkway out of the forest visible to the east. Small green grasses and weeds have found their home within the cracks of the stones, though they are trodden in a few places. A dusting of sand veils the cobblestone, deposited from the heavy foot traffic in the area. The laughter of the nearby brook, encompassed with the shrill cry of distant birds, creates an aura of solitude. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.
You see exits leading east and southwest.

The abundance of healthy vegetation growing along the path's edge threatens to block passage ahead, which has resulted in the various wildflowers and grasses being trampled in places.

A majestic falcon perches nearby, gauging its surroundings with a cautious gaze. There are 2 donkeys here. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.
