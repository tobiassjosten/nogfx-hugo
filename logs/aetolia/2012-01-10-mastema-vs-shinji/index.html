Pain unlike anything you have felt before screams through every inch of you, as though your very psyche was being torn asunder, a moment of pure suffering abruptly and blissfully cut short with your soul having been unceremoniously ripped from its corporeal shell.
Vibrant essence streams forth from the floor, signaling the end of combat.
