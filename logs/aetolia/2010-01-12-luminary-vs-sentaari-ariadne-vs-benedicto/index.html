At the base of the Lleisian Tree. (Lleisian Forest.)
Surrounded by the overgrown stone ruins of ancient architecture, the great Lleisian Tree towers 
overhead in all its natural glory. A huge oak tree of mammoth proportions, the Lleisian Tree is a 
testament to the strength of nature in the face of time and its ravages. The tree stands tall and 
strong in the midst of the ruins of what looks to have been a spacious, circular room. The remains 
of a border show through in between the surface roots, as if this tree had been the centerpiece of 
the room, only to have outgrown its boundaries over time. The tree's branches start rather low to 
the ground, and continue up its trunk in a random, but almost ladder-like fashion, allowing even the
most novice of treeclimbers easy access to the top. Cradled in the Lleisian Tree's upper branches is
what looks to be a dark obelisk, extending down at an angle toward a spot in the northeast. The 
shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.
You see exits leading east, southwest, northwest and up.

Nearing a bubbling brook. (lost) (Lleisian Forest.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. Greeted by the sounds of a bubbling stream and a small 
flowing waterfall, a feeling of peace pervades the area. Beautiful orchids sway in the gentle 
passing breeze, seemingly keeping a watch over the various fish that lazily propel themselves 
through the stream. A giant oak tree towers over you here, dividing whatever light the sky may give 
into even rays that sit comfortably, unmoving on the small grassy knolls that surround you. An 
icewall is here, blocking passage to the east. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the west. The
shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.
You see exits leading east and west.

Your aura of weapons rebounding disappears. (skullcap)
You nod gravely at your Guardian Angel, whose wings flare suddenly as an alien and frightening look 
of power sweeps across her face. With one hand, she reaches forward and as her hand touches 
Benedicto's chest, it flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters his breast. The Angel's eyes 
roll back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Benedicto's body. Benedicto collapses 
without a sound; his body now nothing more than a useless husk.
You have slain Benedicto.

Entrance to the jousting grounds. (Enorian.) [-Dhar-]
The air shimmers between two huge pyramidal menhirs that mark the portal beckoning the way into the 
arena below. Scenes depicting heroic combatants are etched deeply into each of the four sides of the
pillars, signifying great battles of the past and those yet to come. The earth is well trodden, 
having been packed hard by the numerous accomplished combatants, as well as those amateur to the 
combative arts. Evidence of foot traffic is everywhere - the grass is trampled, sword lashes scar 
the earth, and black scorch marks are reminiscent of the power of those who wield fire. Curiously, 
the ground beyond the coruscating portal remains untouched by the regular skirmishes. A 
flame-charred chariot pulled by demonic goats stands here. A bright-eyed missionary serenely patrols
the streets of Enorian. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. The shining figure
of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Lanira Bezaliel is here.

At the base of the Lleisian Tree. (Lleisian Forest.)
Surrounded by the overgrown stone ruins of ancient architecture, the great Lleisian Tree towers 
overhead in all its natural glory. A huge oak tree of mammoth proportions, the Lleisian Tree is a 
testament to the strength of nature in the face of time and its ravages. The tree stands tall and 
strong in the midst of the ruins of what looks to have been a spacious, circular room. The remains 
of a border show through in between the surface roots, as if this tree had been the centerpiece of 
the room, only to have outgrown its boundaries over time. The tree's branches start rather low to 
the ground, and continue up its trunk in a random, but almost ladder-like fashion, allowing even the
most novice of treeclimbers easy access to the top. Cradled in the Lleisian Tree's upper branches is
what looks to be a dark obelisk, extending down at an angle toward a spot in the northeast. A stout 
donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in 
the air here.
You see exits leading east, southwest, northwest and up.

You nod gravely at your Guardian Angel, whose wings flare suddenly as an alien and frightening look 
of power sweeps across her face. With one hand, she reaches forward and as her hand touches 
Benedicto's chest, it flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters his breast. The Angel's eyes 
roll back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Benedicto's body. Benedicto collapses 
without a sound; his body now nothing more than a useless husk.
You have slain Benedicto.

At the base of the Lleisian Tree. (Lleisian Forest.)
Surrounded by the overgrown stone ruins of ancient architecture, the great Lleisian Tree towers
overhead in all its natural glory. A huge oak tree of mammoth proportions, the Lleisian Tree is a
testament to the strength of nature in the face of time and its ravages. The tree stands tall and
strong in the midst of the ruins of what looks to have been a spacious, circular room. The remains
of a border show through in between the surface roots, as if this tree had been the centerpiece of
the room, only to have outgrown its boundaries over time. The tree's branches start rather low to
the ground, and continue up its trunk in a random, but almost ladder-like fashion, allowing even the
most novice of treeclimbers easy access to the top. Cradled in the Lleisian Tree's upper branches is
what looks to be a dark obelisk, extending down at an angle toward a spot in the northeast. The
shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.
You see exits leading east, southwest, northwest and up.

Nearing a bubbling brook. (lost) (Lleisian Forest.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. Greeted by the sounds of a bubbling stream and a small
flowing waterfall, a feeling of peace pervades the area. Beautiful orchids sway in the gentle
passing breeze, seemingly keeping a watch over the various fish that lazily propel themselves
through the stream. A giant oak tree towers over you here, dividing whatever light the sky may give
into even rays that sit comfortably, unmoving on the small grassy knolls that surround you. An
icewall is here, blocking passage to the east. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the west. The
shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.
You see exits leading east and west.

Entrance to the jousting grounds. (Enorian.) [-Dhar-]
The air shimmers between two huge pyramidal menhirs that mark the portal beckoning the way into the
arena below. Scenes depicting heroic combatants are etched deeply into each of the four sides of the
pillars, signifying great battles of the past and those yet to come. The earth is well trodden,
having been packed hard by the numerous accomplished combatants, as well as those amateur to the
combative arts. Evidence of foot traffic is everywhere - the grass is trampled, sword lashes scar
the earth, and black scorch marks are reminiscent of the power of those who wield fire. Curiously,
the ground beyond the coruscating portal remains untouched by the regular skirmishes. A
flame-charred chariot pulled by demonic goats stands here. A bright-eyed missionary serenely patrols
the streets of Enorian. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. The shining figure
of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Lanira Bezaliel is here.
You see exits leading east and out.

At the base of the Lleisian Tree. (Lleisian Forest.)
Surrounded by the overgrown stone ruins of ancient architecture, the great Lleisian Tree towers
overhead in all its natural glory. A huge oak tree of mammoth proportions, the Lleisian Tree is a
testament to the strength of nature in the face of time and its ravages. The tree stands tall and
strong in the midst of the ruins of what looks to have been a spacious, circular room. The remains
of a border show through in between the surface roots, as if this tree had been the centerpiece of
the room, only to have outgrown its boundaries over time. The tree's branches start rather low to
the ground, and continue up its trunk in a random, but almost ladder-like fashion, allowing even the
most novice of treeclimbers easy access to the top. Cradled in the Lleisian Tree's upper branches is
what looks to be a dark obelisk, extending down at an angle toward a spot in the northeast. A stout
donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in
the air here.

of power sweeps across her face. With one hand, she reaches forward and as her hand touches

without a sound; his body now nothing more than a useless husk.
You have slain Benedicto.
Defeated, Benedicto is cast out of the Arena.
