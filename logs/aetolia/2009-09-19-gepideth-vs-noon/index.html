With a vicious snarl you carve a merciless swathe through the steaming guts of Noon, who gurgles and chokes as you withdraw your dripping blade, glistening with gore.
The last vestiges of strength having ebbed from Noon's body, he sinks to the floor with a sigh. Suddenly, your surroundings are enveloped in a blinding white light, forcing you to cower with your hands over your eyes. When you tentatively open them once more, you are astonished to find Noon alive once more.
Noon quickly changes back into Human form.

When you tentatively open them once more, you are astonished to find Noon alive once more.
Noon quickly changes back into Human form.
Your victim is protected by a caged soul.
