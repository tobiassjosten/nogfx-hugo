Southeastern corner of a bleak prison yard. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
The frost-laden slate upon the ground makes walking treacherous here, the ice 
having forced fissures into the tile. Traces of flora have desperately taken 
advantage of the broken slate, growing feebly here and there. Tall stone 
ramparts rise up on all sides of you, reaching overhead. To the west is a great 
breach in the southern wall, rubble scattered in the wake of an ancient 
explosion. To the north, the prison tower rises up against the sky. The silence 
is oppressive here, the area seeming devoid of life. Hackles raised, an adult 
grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Silent and observant, a red fox stands 
here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Nervously pacing, a 
small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of night 
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on 
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger 
stands here, snuffling about angrily.

A silent prison courtyard. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
The usual signs of life are eerily absent here in this stone courtyard. The 
walls of the prison tower rise up to the north, grim and imposing against the 
sky. The ground has been laid in slate, the tiles cracked and ancient. The stone
is coated with a thin layer of ice, making tread a bit treacherous if one 
doesn't pay close attention to their step. A tall stone barrier surrounds the 
court, with ramparts once used for constant surveillance of the prison yard. A 
large section of the southwest rampart has been blown apart by some great force,
giving a hint as to why this prison yard is now deserted. To the south an 
ominous barred gate can be seen, forbidding freedom. Silent and observant, a red
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Nervously
pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of 
night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger 
stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs 
the air for enemies.
You see exits leading north, east, south and west.

A silent prison courtyard. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
The usual signs of life are eerily absent here in this stone courtyard. The 
walls of the prison tower rise up to the north, grim and imposing against the 
sky. The ground has been laid in slate, the tiles cracked and ancient. The stone
is coated with a thin layer of ice, making tread a bit treacherous if one 
doesn't pay close attention to their step. A tall stone barrier surrounds the 
court, with ramparts once used for constant surveillance of the prison yard. A 
large section of the southwest rampart has been blown apart by some great force,
giving a hint as to why this prison yard is now deserted. To the south an 
ominous barred gate can be seen, forbidding freedom. Silent and observant, a red
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Nervously
pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of 
night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger 
stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs 
the air for enemies.
You see exits leading north, east, south and west.

A great rampart towers over the surroundings from the east, the wall continuing 
all around before disappearing behind the foreboding prison tower to the north. 
To the south, stand the sealed gates of the complex, and to its west, a gaping 
depression within the rampart, rubble and debris scattered in the wake of an 
ancient explosion. The slate tiles upon the ground have been greatly damaged to 
the extent of which it appears possible to dislodge a few, and a few stomps on 
the ground suggest that there is a hollow space below. Silent and observant, a 
red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. 
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the 
colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. 
Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A 
grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult 
grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies.

East of the prison spire. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
The courtyard has narrowed into an abrupt corner here, the grim prison tower 
looming overhead to the west. The tall ramparts ensure that there are no dark 
alleyways to hide in, keeping its hostages in plain view of whatever guard once 
patrolled this now abandoned prison yard. Ice has ravaged the tiles upon the 
ground, making movement treacherous as the slate is slick and broken in places. 
The smell of pinesap pervades the senses, giving a hint as to what's on the 
other side of the prison walls. The only sound here is the occasional howl of 
frigid wind, biting at the skin. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, 
alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of 
night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger 
stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs 
the air for enemies.

Before the prison spire. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
From the courtyard a cracked stone path leads towards to the tall metal doors of
this foreboding spire. Two marble statues stand upon each side of the entrance, 
both depicting tall armored figures looking down on those unfortunate enough to 
end up in this place. Some stray weeds have started to push their way through 
the path causing cracks to appear throughout. Close to the path a rusted 
flagpole leans against the walls of the prison, a flag depicting the Spirean 
tricolor clinging feebly from the end of it. Silent and observant, a red fox 
stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the 
colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. 
Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A 
grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult 
grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies.
You see exits leading north, east, south and west.

A dilapidated garden path. (Ironmaw Gardens.)
The devastating effects the bitter northern frosts have had on this once lush 
garden are quite obvious. The bushes that lined the path into through the garden
entrance now appear to be only skeletons of branches and bark reaching out over 
the pathway. A stone path winds its way around the garden, though its surface is
crumbling, cracked and worn from cold, snow, and the occasional knobby root 
having punched its way to the surface. While evidence of a more assorted variety
of plants exists, through time and mismanagement it seems as if a few species of
bush and bloom have managed to choke out the rest. The garden is mostly 
dominated by a low to the ground bush that covers seems to cover entire sections
of the garden like dull green carpet, though close examination reveals the stiff
leaves hiding wicked red thorns across its branches. The garden itself is 
situated overtop a slight hill with the peak dominated by several thickly leaved
spruce trees, their branches hanging low to the ground and laden with many 
needles. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with 
a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and 
observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge 
gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling 
about angrily.
You see exits leading northeast and south.

Forest approaching the prison. (Ironmaw Gardens.)
The overhead canopy blackens out the sun prohibiting much of the sunlight from 
striking the forest floor. Gnarled roots of nearby trees protrude throughout the
rich earth, obscuring the already disintegrating path. A striking aroma of 
decayed leaves and other plants are distinguishable through the cold, thin air. 
A distant sound of an leaves and the howling of the wind. Silent and observant, 
a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. 
Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A 
grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult 
grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies.
You see exits leading north, northeast and southeast.

A fork in the gardens. (Ironmaw Gardens.)
The contour of the land dips down into a shallow basin here, likely the resting 
place of some ancient pond or the result of a shifting sinkhole. The upward 
slope is peppered with scraggly plants trying to survive in the harsh 
environment with the occasional young aspen tree standing tall and stark against
the horizon. A little traveled pathway lies across the area barely 
distinguishable from the surrounding ground. Forking before a large statue 
situated at the bottom of the depression, one section of the path veers off to 
the northwest into a clutch of pines that make up the entrance to the tundra 
forest, while the other path curves off through the overgrown garden. At the 
lowest point in the basin a worn, stone statue can be viewed. Nervously pacing, 
a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Hackles raised, an adult grey 
wolf sniffs the air for enemies.

A foreboding entryway. (lost) (Ironmaw Prison Spire.)
The most striking feature of this massive entryway is the spiral stone staircase
which snakes upwards to the top of the spire. A broken mosaic has been inlaid
into the floor, while most of the tiles are missing it can be made out as once
showing the Spirean Tricolor in all its glory. A desk crafted from a single
piece of rock stands ominously in the centre of the room, though vulgar writings
have been engraved into its surface. The smell of damp and decay is strong in
here, as the sounds of small feet clicking against the floor can be heard
passing through the room occasionally. Huge doorways leads to various parts of
the ground floor, a chill wind blowing in from the northwest. Hackles raised, an
adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Prince Shoren Ta'sa, Forest Daemon
is here, hidden. He wields a throwing axe in his left hand and a hunter's spear
in his right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, northwest and up.

Southeastern corner of a bleak prison yard. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
The frost-laden slate upon the ground makes walking treacherous here, the ice
having forced fissures into the tile. Traces of flora have desperately taken
advantage of the broken slate, growing feebly here and there. Tall stone
ramparts rise up on all sides of you, reaching overhead. To the west is a great
breach in the southern wall, rubble scattered in the wake of an ancient
explosion. To the north, the prison tower rises up against the sky. The silence
is oppressive here, the area seeming devoid of life. Hackles raised, an adult
grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Silent and observant, a red fox stands
here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Nervously pacing, a
small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of night
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger
stands here, snuffling about angrily.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

A silent prison courtyard. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
The usual signs of life are eerily absent here in this stone courtyard. The
walls of the prison tower rise up to the north, grim and imposing against the
sky. The ground has been laid in slate, the tiles cracked and ancient. The stone
is coated with a thin layer of ice, making tread a bit treacherous if one
doesn't pay close attention to their step. A tall stone barrier surrounds the
court, with ramparts once used for constant surveillance of the prison yard. A
large section of the southwest rampart has been blown apart by some great force,
giving a hint as to why this prison yard is now deserted. To the south an
ominous barred gate can be seen, forbidding freedom. Silent and observant, a red
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Nervously
pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of
night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger
stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs
the air for enemies.
You see exits leading north, east, south and west.

A silent prison courtyard. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
The usual signs of life are eerily absent here in this stone courtyard. The
walls of the prison tower rise up to the north, grim and imposing against the
sky. The ground has been laid in slate, the tiles cracked and ancient. The stone
is coated with a thin layer of ice, making tread a bit treacherous if one
doesn't pay close attention to their step. A tall stone barrier surrounds the
court, with ramparts once used for constant surveillance of the prison yard. A
large section of the southwest rampart has been blown apart by some great force,
giving a hint as to why this prison yard is now deserted. To the south an
ominous barred gate can be seen, forbidding freedom. Silent and observant, a red
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Nervously
pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of
night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger
stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs
the air for enemies.
You see exits leading north, east, south and west.

Along the eastern rampart. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
A great rampart towers over the surroundings from the east, the wall continuing
all around before disappearing behind the foreboding prison tower to the north.
To the south, stand the sealed gates of the complex, and to its west, a gaping
depression within the rampart, rubble and debris scattered in the wake of an
ancient explosion. The slate tiles upon the ground have been greatly damaged to
the extent of which it appears possible to dislodge a few, and a few stomps on
the ground suggest that there is a hollow space below. Silent and observant, a
red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye.
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the
colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes.
Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A
grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult
grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies.

East of the prison spire. (Ironmaw Courtyard.)
The courtyard has narrowed into an abrupt corner here, the grim prison tower
looming overhead to the west. The tall ramparts ensure that there are no dark
alleyways to hide in, keeping its hostages in plain view of whatever guard once
patrolled this now abandoned prison yard. Ice has ravaged the tiles upon the
ground, making movement treacherous as the slate is slick and broken in places.
The smell of pinesap pervades the senses, giving a hint as to what's on the
other side of the prison walls. The only sound here is the occasional howl of
frigid wind, biting at the skin. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here,
alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of
night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger
stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs
the air for enemies.

A dilapidated garden path. (Ironmaw Gardens.)
The devastating effects the bitter northern frosts have had on this once lush
garden are quite obvious. The bushes that lined the path into through the garden
entrance now appear to be only skeletons of branches and bark reaching out over
the pathway. A stone path winds its way around the garden, though its surface is
crumbling, cracked and worn from cold, snow, and the occasional knobby root
having punched its way to the surface. While evidence of a more assorted variety
of plants exists, through time and mismanagement it seems as if a few species of
bush and bloom have managed to choke out the rest. The garden is mostly
dominated by a low to the ground bush that covers seems to cover entire sections
of the garden like dull green carpet, though close examination reveals the stiff
leaves hiding wicked red thorns across its branches. The garden itself is
situated overtop a slight hill with the peak dominated by several thickly leaved
spruce trees, their branches hanging low to the ground and laden with many
needles. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with
a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and
observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge
gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling

Forest approaching the prison. (Ironmaw Gardens.)
The overhead canopy blackens out the sun prohibiting much of the sunlight from
striking the forest floor. Gnarled roots of nearby trees protrude throughout the
rich earth, obscuring the already disintegrating path. A striking aroma of
decayed leaves and other plants are distinguishable through the cold, thin air.
A distant sound of an leaves and the howling of the wind. Silent and observant,
a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye.

A fork in the gardens. (Ironmaw Gardens.)
The contour of the land dips down into a shallow basin here, likely the resting
place of some ancient pond or the result of a shifting sinkhole. The upward
slope is peppered with scraggly plants trying to survive in the harsh
environment with the occasional young aspen tree standing tall and stark against
the horizon. A little traveled pathway lies across the area barely
distinguishable from the surrounding ground. Forking before a large statue
situated at the bottom of the depression, one section of the path veers off to
the northwest into a clutch of pines that make up the entrance to the tundra
forest, while the other path curves off through the overgrown garden. At the
lowest point in the basin a worn, stone statue can be viewed. Nervously pacing,
