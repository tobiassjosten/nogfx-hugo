Purple moths. Everywhere. In your mind, in your head, in your skin, making it shift and bulge.

You have emoted: Lin bolts upright, her eyes snapping open. She has scarcely moved in her burrow, except to pack fallen snow out of the way. It occurred to her to conceal the hole with snow and not her cloak, and using the latter, she has kept a little warmer than before, though still incoherent, taken by hypothermia. "I- I see You," she whispers.

The moths aren&#39;t really there; they flutter, flicker, indistinct in your mind&#39;s eye. Just wishful thought, wishful dreaming. Hallucinations, brought on by your closeness to the Underking&#39;s realm. Even now, you balance on the edge between the two opposed courts; where the Dreamless stand.

But you, of course, are not Dreamless. You dream even now, you realize.

You have emoted: Lin curls into a tight ball - anyone discovering her would find only a lump of a cloak, its slight form melded into the snow in such a way that it would be assumed empty. Her mind tends toward morbid, panicky imaginings - she begins to envision unfathomable distances of snow built up over her shelter over the course of days. She thinks of herself leaving this accursed prison at last, her body wasted and grey, no one recognizing her. She sees moths, thinks of reaching out to one, sees her flesh curling and bubbling in unexpected heat, tissue falling away from bone. Her eyes are wide open in the dark.

Then there She is, against you. Mother. MOTHER. She&#39;s warm. She&#39;s everything you want; warmth, fire, passion, PAIN, SENSATION. She melds to you, hugs you close, an imagining made real by desperation and terror. Her lips sink against the hollow of your neck; press in. Draw up. Dot every inch they find, until She passes your chin, your jawbone, and kisses hard against your lips. A small sigh escapes the Goddess at this contact, and She arches against you, lets you feel Her passion, so hot that She almost BURNS against your nearly-bare form.

You have emoted: Lin moans in a weak voice, her lips barely moving against what she feels, but not for lack of trying. She embraces her Mother Goddess desperately, seeking refuge and sanctuary against near-death in Her bosom, and at the same time, her body yearning for more familiar, primal urges, shuddering emotionally at such unexpected warmth and pleasure. At last she allows herself to cry, so much relief washing through her, sand mingling with snow in an environmental impossibility.

You burn hot, burn bright, filled with heat, moths beating weakly under your skin; they seek to be free, but as Mother holds you close, they don&#39;t NEED to be. Purple glows in you, over you, under you, BENEATH you, and you are utterly surrounded by it, visions circling rapidly before your eyes before, again, you&#39;re in the forest you occupied before. This time, though - this time the sky is empty, open, filled with fleeting ice crystals, and the trees and plants are opposed by high, cold drifts of snow.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s head rolls back, she struggles to maintain her coherent thought, what little she had. Getting her bearings, her eyes drink in the landscape, and this time it is with excitement, wings of her own beating in her heart. The world seems full of potential, not a threat. She shivers, but it is no longer from the cold, and though her mind can be felt reaching out to the monotonous spans of the haven space, she remains wholly fixated on the Divine presence in her company, envisioning Her gruesome face, trying to keep the images intact as she moves to caress Her, warm her face against Her skin.

But She fades, She fades away, another wishful thought, and you&#39;re left with numbness; numbness, unclear thought, and a pervading sense of dreamwalking through the cold, snowed-in forest. The trees are sparse, the canopy equally so, and dim light stabs down, casting strange shadows on the snow. A hunting horn is in your hand.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s teeth bare as she grimaces, her heart sinking, crushed, like love lost, like life&#39;s treasure diminished in the blink of an eye. She lifts her eyes, takes in the snowscape again with resignation. Her feet move without her saying so. She turns the horn over and over in her hands, unsure what to make of it.

Shapes are moving distantly in the trees; the leaves shiver, flutter in the cold winds, some brown, some still lush and living. Like you, the forest is half-alive, the glimmering sounds of bells ringing through them, and you notice a set of footsteps, leading straight away from where you&#39;re standing. Someone has passed here before you.

You have emoted: Lin stares at those footsteps for what seems like forever, working options over in her mind. She turns and realized she can no longer see her burrow or even remember how she got out of it. A feeling of despair manifests in her belly like a fist, but before it can linger, it is killed, as Lin pulls in a lungful of freezing air and blows on the horn as hard and as loudly as she can, before taking off in the direction of the footsteps with unnatural haste, her cloak billowing.

One of the shapes takes off running; you&#39;re pursuing it, trees rushing by, hovering ice crystals CUTTING into you, spurring you on as though you were some bloodhound; you can feel moths bursting from your skin, joining you in the hunt, DRIPPING with your blood as they beat forward, zipping and swerving through the thickly-clustered trunks. Through shadow and light you rush, through falling leaves and brown, and the figure, the one you&#39;re HUNTING... the figure stays ahead of you, running, fleet, fast, an unnatural silhouette.

You have emoted: Lin begins to run, her circulation working overtime, pumping warmth back into her system. She forgets her cold, she forgets dark days spent in the hole, falling through nightmarish drifts of her deepest thoughts. Every deep breath is a freezing splash that keeps her awake, her claws extended and tasting the snow, ready to find this thing and kill it. Her gait is quick and silent, her body low to the ground when she hunts, and the feeling in her heart is life, pure and simple the way she always wanted it.

The figure draws closer, closer, nearer, nearer, you can SMELL them now, FEEL the snow giving under your feet, the forest thicker, the moths thicker, everything narrowing in focus, INTENSITY...

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s pace slows. Her breath fogs about her face as she eventually comes to a halt, as low as she can be to the snow, trying to maintain a low profile. A moment of yearning fear overcomes her, torn between the urge to charge the last bit of distance to this person, to tackle them, death from above, and swiftly end their life... or to reach out to this soul, perhaps find a like mind. Her decision, however, seems almost certain, as with unfurled claws, she bunches up her legs and makes a powerful sprint at the silhouette.

The silhouette turns, and just as you strike it, something strikes YOU; you&#39;re bowled over into the snow, into the tangled vines, the forest howling around you. The silhouette is turned to you, now, and you realize, with a start...

...it&#39;s YOU.

You have emoted: Lin sits up shakily, rubbing at her sore face, beginning to breathe so quickly she&#39;s on the verge of hyperventilation as she stares at her own reflection. "No," she says, "No, no, no..."

You attack yourself, throwing yourself into the snow, snarling, exultant, ECSTATIC. Your reflection is every inch you, everything you hate in yourself, every inch of madness and desire and lust. She wears a crown, now, a queen&#39;s crown that you tremble to behold, and she&#39;s attempting to claw you to death. "I have NO ONE," she tells you. "I have myself and MOTHER and I&#39;m STRONG."

You have emoted: Lin catches a set of razors across the face, snarls, and bodily forces her doppleganger back, lunging into her with her own retort of strikes and frenzied swipes. "You CAN&#39;T be!" she cries to herself, her voice pleading, "Your FRIENDS made you strong, friends, LOVERS, the people who GOT you here!"

You have emoted: "I don&#39;t-- I don&#39;t know--" Lin stumbles suddenly, her horrified gaze at the sky, her attacking subsided. "Isn&#39;t... isn&#39;t that right?"

Your reflection takes full advantage of your uncertainty, laughing, clawing at you, bludgeoning you to the ground and leaping on top of you. The moths swarm, circle, DANCE around you, mad passions inciting them, their whispers ALMOST intelligible. "FUCK them," whispers your double. "Fuck them ALL. I got here and then they didn&#39;t matter anymore, NONE of them mattered. What I have is enough. I&#39;m queen of the WORLD."

You have emoted: Lin pants for breath, wincing as cold wind razes over the gashes in her flesh. Her eyes struggle to take in every moth and still keep focused on her mirror image. There is only dread for the girl, dread and hate. "You wouldn&#39;t... you know you would never forget your shavora... you- you stupid wretch, you would starve yourself if it made them happy... WHY couldn&#39;t you stand up for yourself!? How are you so strong? Are you Lin, Iro, someone else!? I don&#39;t understand..."

The ice crystals dance in the air, clear and cold and cruel, just as cruel as the vision of yourself that dances before you. She is not that simple, though, not so easily named, and she laughs off your attempts to do so. "You are looking at the strongest woman in the world. Nothing more or less. Names do not CONSTRAIN me. All know me and FEAR me..." She leans down, so much stronger than you, so much BETTER, so much less vulnerable. "Or envy me, as YOU do."

You have emoted: Lin shuts her eyes, cold again, cold and scared and everything this better Lin is not. "I do..." she agrees, and opening her eyes, she glares furiously into her own face. "I envy you so much... you are the part of me that wants to bathe in blood, to command men to their deaths... to deliver a world to a Goddess with a smile. Can I- can I still do that? Are you my future?" Judging by the tone in her voice, it sounds as if she hopes it is.

"That depends," you purr to yourself, you lean down; somehow you are both these creatures at once, the weaker, the stronger, one isolated and cold like the scenery around you, the other - you, YOU - possessing of the Nightmare&#39;s warmth, fighting back the chill that this other so thoroughly embodies. One the demon, one the mortal... "Are you strong or WEAK?"

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s throat pulses as she gulps deeply, sweat running down her face in spite of the tremendous cold. "Strong. Strong. STRONG. Not this soft bitch... not- no... I am YOU." Her hand caresses the cheek of her dominant self, her throat and wrists bared, signs of submission. "I am done with this... I have always wanted to be you, that is why am no longer human!"

You hit yourself. HARD. At first it&#39;s difficult to tell which has stricken the other, but they&#39;re one in the same, whimpering and cringing alike, writhing in the snow, your nose broken, gushing blood, gushing warmth. "WEAK," comes the accusation, booming in your head. "Alone is WEAK. You have chosen WEAKNESS."

You have emoted: "No!" Lin cries, her breath wet and ragged as she pulls her arms protectively around her twin. "She- aaagh, she has things I need, I- I cannot live without her... and she knows she cannot kill me...! Please, I beg of you..." At odds with the surging emotions in her head, she cradles the other Lin viciously, no matter how the vision might react to such treatment. "We are both weak... and both so very strong... can&#39;t- can&#39;t live divided, like this..."

You say, "Her viciousness... my tenderness. Her loyalty and determination... my free spirit. Both of us passionate... both of us... tragically stupid, full of love, even if it we offer it to different things...!"

Your duplicate attacks you, strikes you, makes you SUFFER for the necessity of her; with each blow, you recall words. Angry words, STRONG words, words that drove others away, lapses in temper, and then, eventually, the COLD, chilling you, testing you, the cold you have somehow endured until now. Pain sings in your frame, and your mirror image stares down at you, shuddering, gasping, so utterly YOU that she hurts to behold. "You need more than HER," comes another voice, one that belongs to you and yet not you.

You have emoted: Weeping, Lin reaches out to her twin, possessed by the notion that the violent, snarling thing seems pathetic, in need of care, reaching up to stroke her shoulder with a bloody, frostbitten hand. A marriage of fury and sympathy rests in her eyes. "Tell me... and- and no tricks, tell me the truth..."

Your twin holds to you, hitting, striking, but eventually she stops punishing you, stops HATING you for your weakness; for to her it is strength, even as her strength, to you, reflects as weakness. You are linked together, tied inextricably, and the voice is the two of you both united, speaking in something more than words: "Be whole. Need others. Only then will you be strong."

You have emoted: Lin accepts each blow, grunting lightly but bearing the pain graciously, wearing only a tear-framed smile for her feral half. "I promise You," she whispers, and then in a lower voice, she rises slightly from the snow and says, "I... promise you also." She sets her palm flat over the other&#39;s heart. "No power in... being alone."

You are held, possessed, kissed, OWNED; and it isn&#39;t you, anymore, but the Lady, for you have melted back into yourself and left only Her. She tears your lip apart with Her teeth, draws back, and is blown away by the wind, moths once more, quickly dispersed and cast to the icy winds. The world shrinks in, until there is only your hole, your freezing, torturous, dark hole, which you have never left.

You have emoted: In a way, being entirely numb is a relief, compared to Lin&#39;s prior state of lying bloodied in the snow. She experiences a flash of adoration, and then the natural disappointment of sensations lost... but lying in her burrow, a hellish den only marginally better than the scathing tundra outside, she manages to crack a tiny smile, drifting into a hard-earned slumber.

And as you drift off, the moths blanket you, warm you, reward you. You will not die here.'>____________
_ __ ________/ Day Twelve \________ __ _
Purple moths. Everywhere. In your mind, in your head, in your skin, making it shift and bulge.
You have emoted: Lin bolts upright, her eyes snapping open. She has scarcely moved in her burrow, except to pack fallen snow out of the way. It occurred to her to conceal the hole with snow and not her cloak, and using the latter, she has kept a little warmer than before, though still incoherent, taken by hypothermia. "I- I see You," she whispers.

You are linked together, tied inextricably, and the voice is the two of you both united, speaking in something more than words: "Be whole. Need others. Only then will you be strong."
You have emoted: Lin accepts each blow, grunting lightly but bearing the pain graciously, wearing only a tear-framed smile for her feral half. "I promise You," she whispers, and then in a lower voice, she rises slightly from the snow and says, "I... promise you also." She sets her palm flat over the other's heart. "No power in... being alone."
You are held, possessed, kissed, OWNED; and it isn't you, anymore, but the Lady, for you have melted back into yourself and left only Her. She tears your lip apart with Her teeth, draws back, and is blown away by the wind, moths once more, quickly dispersed and cast to the icy winds. The world shrinks in, until there is only your hole, your freezing, torturous, dark hole, which you have never left.
You have emoted: In a way, being entirely numb is a relief, compared to Lin's prior state of lying bloodied in the snow. She experiences a flash of adoration, and then the natural disappointment of sensations lost... but lying in her burrow, a hellish den only marginally better than the scathing tundra outside, she manages to crack a tiny smile, drifting into a hard-earned slumber.
And as you drift off, the moths blanket you, warm you, reward you. You will not die here.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
