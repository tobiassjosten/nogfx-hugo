On the banks of Lake Khepria. (Lake Khepria.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. You can barely hear your own voice above the deafening roar of the waterfall. There is no pause between where the jungle ends and the lake begins. There are trees growing right out of the bank and vines hanging from the edges of the canopy down into the lake below. The water is clear as glass, and you can see brightly colored fish swimming amidst razor sharp rocks. A fine mist hangs over the lake, obscuring your view of the other side, and a narrow, rickety footbridge vanishes into the mist to the east. A path leads to the northeast towards a clearing, and another path seems to follow the river's flow to the southwest. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.
You see exits leading northeast, southwest and down.

Ruined temple baths. (road). (Temple of Skulls.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. Light pours in and casts an eerie glow upon everything, playing with shadows in this room of the past. Huge blocks of marble are strewn about in haphazard chunks, never having moved from the places they've tumbled in a time only the Divine remember. The floor is cracked and shattered in places that the unwary need watch their step. In the center of the room is a space which appears to have been a communal bath, but toppled through the middle is a large pillar that obscures the flow of a hot water spring. You can hear the slight bubbling of the water as it wells up from beneath the stone, air slightly misty with its released steam. There is a sickeningly sweet smell wafting from the vines that lace the remains of the wall and are slowly taking over, tearing the room apart. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.
You see a single exit leading south.

Firm, yet expressive features compliment this unique breed of horse. Its midnight black coat outlines its angular back and well-muscled legs. Broad of chest but still relatively sleek, this stallion is clearly surpassing in both endurance and agility. The only apparent problem with the horse is its obvious bad temperament, frequently biting out and pawing the ground restlessly.
A midnight black stallion looks weak and feeble.
He weighs about 600 pound(s).
He is loyal to Blood Knight Tyriik Bouchard, Red Ruin.

Deep in the heart of the jungle. (Quietus Weald.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. You are now in the darkest part of the jungle, and you quickly sense that this is a place of death and insanity. Slithering, creeping, and rumbling sounds fill your ears. You have no idea whether it is night or day, you merely stumble around searching for some sort of path through the trees. When your fingers touch the ground, they feel scaly things running around. As you look around, all kinds of eyes seem to peer out at you from the gloom. The ominous feeling of being watched will not go away, there are two paths leading away from this place, a very dim light seeping in from each. A kola tree is growing here. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.
You see exits leading east and south.

As you get closer you can just make out writing sketched across the archway in a language that only the Divine can understand. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the in. A midnight black stallion trots menacingly here. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.

Deep in the Jungle. (Quietus Weald.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. A kola tree is growing here. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze. A sleek falcon is perched here, preening jet black feathers. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Blood Knight Tyriik Bouchard, Red Ruin is riding on a midnight black stallion. He wields a gleaming teradrite rapier in his left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right.

On the banks of Lake Khepria. (Lake Khepria.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. You can barely hear your own voice above the deafening roar of the waterfall. There is no pause between where the jungle ends and the lake begins. There are trees growing right out of the bank and vines hanging from the edges of the canopy down into the lake below. The water is clear as glass, and you can see brightly colored fish swimming amidst razor sharp rocks. A fine mist hangs over the lake, obscuring your view of the other side, and a narrow, rickety footbridge vanishes into the mist to the east. A path leads to the northeast towards a clearing, and another path seems to follow the river's flow to the southwest. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.
You see exits leading northeast, southwest and down.

Ruined temple baths. (road). (Temple of Skulls.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. Light pours in and casts an eerie glow upon everything, playing with shadows in this room of the past. Huge blocks of marble are strewn about in haphazard chunks, never having moved from the places they've tumbled in a time only the Divine remember. The floor is cracked and shattered in places that the unwary need watch their step. In the center of the room is a space which appears to have been a communal bath, but toppled through the middle is a large pillar that obscures the flow of a hot water spring. You can hear the slight bubbling of the water as it wells up from beneath the stone, air slightly misty with its released steam. There is a sickeningly sweet smell wafting from the vines that lace the remains of the wall and are slowly taking over, tearing the room apart. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.
You see a single exit leading south.

Firm, yet expressive features compliment this unique breed of horse. Its midnight black coat outlines its angular back and well-muscled legs. Broad of chest but still relatively sleek, this stallion is clearly surpassing in both endurance and agility. The only apparent problem with the horse is its obvious bad temperament, frequently biting out and pawing the ground restlessly.
A midnight black stallion looks weak and feeble.
He weighs about 600 pound(s).
He is loyal to Blood Knight Tyriik Bouchard, Red Ruin.

This area is unnaturally flooded with water. You are now in the darkest part of the jungle, and you quickly sense that this is a place of death and insanity. Slithering, creeping, and rumbling sounds fill your ears. You have no idea whether it is night or day, you merely stumble around searching for some sort of path through the trees. When your fingers touch the ground, they feel scaly things running around. As you look around, all kinds of eyes seem to peer out at you from the gloom. The ominous feeling of being watched will not go away, there are two paths leading away from this place, a very dim light seeping in from each. A kola tree is growing here. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.
You see exits leading east and south.

The entrance to a ruined temple. (Quietus Weald.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. As you emerge from the deep jungle, you are surprised to see a huge temple, lying in ruins before you. Most of the roof has collapsed and the trees and wildlife have taken over. Although still intact, the entrance has been covered with vines. It is a huge archway lined with white marble pillars. As you get closer you can just make out writing sketched across the archway in a language that only the Divine can understand. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the in. A midnight black stallion trots menacingly here. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.
You see exits leading east and in.
