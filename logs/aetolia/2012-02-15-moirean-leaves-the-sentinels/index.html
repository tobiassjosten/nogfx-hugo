You tell Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained, "Moirean is repeatedly 
attempting to break into my home in Eleusis. I want to know what I can do about 
this."

Sibatti tells you, "I envision a day when I am not perpetually handling children."


You tell Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained, "Well, I would not be 
allowed to cast her as an enemy of the Council, so what I must essentially do is 
figure out how to fend off someone stronger than me from entering my place."

You tell Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained, "I am sorry if this 
inconveniences you."

    [ Lin is derping around Delos --> Enorian --> Heartwood but eventually
	  comes to say &#39;hi&#39; to her in person. ]

The Sanctuary. (Ancient Heartwood.) (17048)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Birds of every sort flutter about 
their beautiful garden of herbs, flowers, and berries. A large fountain stands 
central in the sanctuary, and pours water into a pool that gently flows out onto 
the waiting plants. Many perches made of stout wood have been fastened to every 
available surface, providing ample spaces for the birds to roost. Earthenware 
bowls and oaken pots lie about, filled to overflowing with seeds and grain to 
feed the birds. Benches are scattered about in no particular order, providing 
places for the birds&#39; admirers to sit and chat. An Eleusian ranger stands guard, 
her hand resting on the hilt of her sword. A small, cheery sapling sits here, 
its leaves a stunning green, and its blossoms a soothing white. Armed with a 
javelin, an Eleusian peltast keeps watch for invaders. A dark brown root sigil 
is here. The regal Heartwood stag grazes on the forest foliage. Esrytesh Sibatti 
dur Naya, the Unrestrained is here.
Exits: down and in (closed pine door).

The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds.

The shadows fade, leaving your footfalls audible once again.

Seated on a high perch, you say, "I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve woken in a vicious mood. If it 
was anyone else I would not have minded so much."

Sibatti crosses her arms and glances up at you, her ears skewed at an angle none 
too pleasant. She only gives you a look, mildly frustrated.

You have emoted: Lin glances once at Sibatti, then pointedly looks away, 
lighting and tending to a thin pipe, jutting from her teeth like an errant 
feather in a bird&#39;s plumage. "I do not know what that look means, Esry."

"It means I am in no mood to be ...." Sibatti uncrosses her arms hastily and 
reaches into her things for a wineskin, uncorking its stop.

Sibatti tips an impressed leather wineskin with serged seams back and draws a 
mouthful of the aged cachaca.

Swallowing, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "Light. Gentle. 
Compassionate, or ... any of the things I should be."

You have emoted: Lin lifts from her perch, her face flashing with anger. "I&#39;m 
not in the mood to--" she clenches her teeth, and swallows her words, sinking 
back into a relaxed position. "I didn&#39;t come here to argue with you about 
anything. I just wanted company."

Sibatti sits in a swift movement on the edge of the stone fountain, her 
shoulders drawn back and the arch of her back harsh. Her brows are angled 
sharply downward, and she takes another sip from her wineskin. "I won&#39;t be very 
good company," she warns, a low rumble in her voice. Her voice quiets, adding, 
"I haven&#39;t had a few good months."

You have emoted: Lin stays on her perch, in view of Sibatti slightly from above, 
but she shifts into an upright sitting position, her legs dangling from the edge.
 Tendrils of smoke waft from the bowl of her pipe. "There is just... so much I 
don&#39;t know. I- I wanted to know how you and -he- were doing. I wanted to... help,
 in any way I could, I suppose as a means of proving that his torment is not my 
fault."

You have emoted: "And because it is a good thing to do, I suppose," Lin mutters.

Sibatti snorts in reply, tipping her nose up and running the palm of her hand 
over her hair, fingertips catching onto her ears and tugging them backwards. She 
seems more inclined to drink than to answer.

Sibatti tips an impressed leather wineskin with serged seams back and draws a 
mouthful of the aged cachaca.

Her voice low, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "At least now I 
know what really happened, as bitter as it makes me feel. I can&#39;t even get to 
the point where I can talk about it without feeling angry - and that&#39;s the best 
part of it all."

You have emoted: "You are angry," Lin says, "And I am in a foul mood. Perhaps it 
would be best if I left you alone for a little while."

Sibatti turns her head to view you in her peripherals, not looking any more 
agreeable than when the conversation started. "Perhaps."

You have emoted: Lin pinches the bridge of her nose. The bough she was sitting 
on flings into the air dangerously as she comes to land on the Sanctuary terrace,
 her eyes set dead ahead with a weary look as she leaves.

Duiran Council Chambers. (Ancient Heartwood.) (17019)
Armed with a javelin, an Eleusian peltast keeps watch for invaders. A carven bit 
of stone has been shaped and etched with runic symbols here, standing vigil over 
the whole of the Heartwood. Wandering hand fingering a throwing knife, a 
wilderness scout keeps watch on activity in the area. A long ornate table is 
here, 5 strange oak chairs placed at it. A sigil in the shape of a small, 
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A dark brown root sigil is here.
Exits: west (open oak door) and up (closed pine door).

You close the door to the west.

    [ Lin goes to the Council Chamber just to hang out. Moirean opens
	  the door repeatedly, which Lin closes right away, but she gets
	  shot twice. She tries to go back to her home instead, when... ]

You are pierced by a black heart arrow that quickly dissipates into the air, 
leaving only the wound behind.
The wound to your heart proves too deep, and your back arches in pain as a 
stream of black energy pours out of you, coursing towards Moirean. When it 
dissipates, a profound emptiness fills your chest.

    [ Lin heads down to her valley at last. She is now overreacting.
	  (Mind Radiance) ]

You bow your head, and concentrate on preparing a channel for your mental power.

You focus your mind, allowing the image of Moirean to form a picture within your 
mind&#39;s eye.

Moirean has left the area.

Your victim is not close enough for you to finish.

Moirean is out of range of your telepathy, and the mental cords between you snap 
instantly.

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Lin. Seriously, radiancing me?"

(Sentinels): You say, "I will not indulge you the way others do."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Radiancing Pridemates is not wise."

(Sentinels): You say, "I will also not argue with you about it here."

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "If you two have a dispute, you resolve it with 
Sacrament. I don&#39;t want to hear about it in -any- other fashion."

(Sentinels): You say, "I just said I would not argue about it."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "You can&#39;t just try to kill a Pridemate and then 
decide you don&#39;t want to talk about it."

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "Lin, you know our law."

(Sentinels): You say, "I wlll not threaten, attack or slay another member of the 
Pride outside of the Sacrament of Enmity."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "I am waiting."

  --> sense Moirean
An image of Within a broken circle of faded crimson appears in your mind. 
(20158)
From your knowledge, that room is in (Ancient Heartwood.)

    [ This is our &#39;arena room&#39; and a chamber we use for the Sacrament
	  of Enmity, which is what two Sentinels who just can&#39;t get along
	  go through. ]

(Sentinels): You say, "I take issue with this."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "You tried to kill me. I don&#39;t think you are in the 
position to take issue."

(Sentinels): You say, "And I wish to know if I will be listened to and taken 
seriously, or if the current climate of the day will keep me from being heard."

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "You are both in the wrong. You initiate the 
Sacrament by speaking to me, as it is scribed."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "How am I in the wrong?"

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "I just said it."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "No, explain it."

(Sentinels): You say, "You broke into my goddamned home, Imp!"

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, ""You initiate the Sacrament by speaking to me"."

(Sentinels): You say, "AGAIN!"

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "When I was told that was your house, I ceased going 
there."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "I have been doing my goddamn best to behave and 
cater to your childish whims and whines, but trying to KILL me is a line you&#39;ve 
crossed that I will not ignore."

(Sentinels): You say, "There is no Sacrament. I do not respect you as a Sentinel.
 If the Prideleader wishes to punish me instead, I will accept that."

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "For the love of.."

(Sentinels): Nadia says, "This conversation does not being here."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "You are the aggressor and broke the guild laws. You 
don&#39;t get to pick your punishment."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Sibatti, I think you are sufficiently informed at 
this point of, at least on my part, the intent for the sacrament."

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "Not another word here. I will see you both in the 
Rotunda."


  --> --> -->


A determined look upon her face, Minsja points her spear at the ground directly 
under your feet. Her eyes radiate with wild power briefly as you feel the ground 
fall away from under your feet.

Suspended mid-air only momentarily, gravity does its work and you plummet 
downward only to land agilely on your feet on the Rotunda below.
The Rotunda. (Ancient Heartwood.) (20151)
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A 
woodland lynx prowls here, eyes darting with scarcely contained ferocity. 
Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Silent and 
observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of 
the eye. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Nervously pacing, 
a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of night 
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on 
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. Fangs extended, 
a venomous forest snake slithers here. A cloaked figure is riding on a donkey. 
She wields a vicious dark brown dhurive in her hands. Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, 
the Unrestrained is here.
Exits: north, east, southeast (open pine door), south (open pine door), 
southwest, west, up (open pine door), and down (open pine door).

Lifting her chin, A cloaked figure says, "I was at the circle."

Sibatti&#39;s eyes glow a faint red as she briefly closes them.

Wiping your face of emotion, you place both feet shoulder-width apart and then 
shift your hands behind your back. Arranging them so the right settles above the 
left, you keep them flat as a board and stare straight at Sibatti.

Your pose is now set as: Lin is here, standing straight with stiffened hands 
settled behind her back.

Moirean gives a cheerful yellow tulip to Sibatti.

"I didn&#39;t realize there was so little happening in the world that we have the 
time and the energy to expend on so much -bullshit-," Sibatti snarls, her voice 
befitting the angered growl of a feral cat.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s eyes narrow reactively but she says nothing.

Crossing her arms over her chest, A cloaked figure says, "Don&#39;t include me in 
this "we." I am the one attacked here - and I respected guild laws and did not 
simply slay her in return."

Kiyotan plummets in from above, landing agilely on his feet.

A cloaked figure raises an eyebrow, frowning, as a look of genuine confusion 
crosses her face. "I&#39;m honestly uncertain why -I- am getting your ire," she 
pouts. "I&#39;m OBEYING the laws. Not killing people." Her pout shifts to a scowl 
and she scuffs at the floor in a short kick. "...and still get yelled at..."

Sibatti&#39;s gaze swings sharply over to A cloaked figure, her fury not even 
lessened one bit. "You respect this law, but I&#39;m still entertaining your 
bullshit with that &#39;Mad Mage&#39; of Bloodloch," retorts.

A cloaked figure raises her hands in protest. "So EVERYTHING I do will be 
colored by that?" she squawks.

Her voice raising, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "You will 
not presume to tell ME to &#39;leave you out&#39; of my statement."

A cloaked figure impatiently shoves back the hood of her cloak with the heel of 
her hand, her snarl of curls bouncing free in a messy wave of crimson.

Moirean deftly lowers the hood of a cloak of obscurity, revealing her identity.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s eyes flicker over to Kiyotan, to whom she offers a 
passing glance, a friendly nod, before returning her attention to the matter at 
hand.

Moirean&#39;s stare remains fixed on Sibatti, glowering. Her arms cross across her 
chest and, taking in her height, slight frame and the lopsided crown askew on 
her head, it&#39;s fairly hard not to connect her image at this moment with that of 
a petulant child.

"You&#39;re -both- wrong, for two different reasons," Sibatti continues, her tone 
sharp. She slips her arms behind her back and entwines them.

In a grumbling mutter, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "Followed 
the rules."

How the huge wolf upon which Kiyotan sits astride managed to stealthily sneak in 
will remain a mystery. Out of the shadow the beast prowls, and the Yeleni slips 
off his back. He stands beside Sibatti, a deferential pace behind. His single 
visible eye shifts between the assembled women, his face an expressionless mask. 
Arms remain folded across a bare torso.

Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says to you, "Taking out your rage 
in such an unrefined and bloodthirsty manner is shameful, and ill-befitting of 
this Pride."

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s chest expands in a single, deep breath, the most she has 
moved in several minutes. "I agree," she says quietly.

Kiyotan gracefully hops off of a massive arctic wolf.

"I don&#39;t know--" Sibatti squeezes her eyes shut, looking suddenly exasperated, 
and takes a deep breath. "I don&#39;t -care- what petty issues you have going on 
between you - gods knows they take priority over those -dismissible- things like 
oath and service in these parts lately - but you NEVER fracture the unity of 
this Pride with your hackneyed solutions."

Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says to Her Highness, Queen Moirean 
of the Imps, "Lin said she told you twice to stop, before I even said a word to 
you."

You have emoted: "Not counting when she did this exact thing a few years ago," 
Lin mutters.

Moirean&#39;s scowl deepens. "I didn&#39;t even KNOW I had an issue with Lin," she 
protests. "She said stay out of her house, so I stopped travelling to her. 
Apparently Keshena also lives there? I didn&#39;t know it was the same residence." 
She turns to you and adds, "...and Ingram said I was invited in as a guest when 
I "intruded" before. Yell at HIM, not me."

You have emoted: At this, Lin returns to her prior silence, meeting Moirean&#39;s 
accusations with only a steady gaze.

Sibatti quirks an eyebrow at you, her voice lowered in volume but still heavy 
with tension. "You could not get these details from her -before- you deemed it 
an unresolvable issue?"

You have emoted: "I know the details," Lin replies. "She has not explained the
-exact- details."

Moirean promptly plops into a seat on the floor, arms still crossed over her 
chest. "Dunno why you even hate me suddenly," she grumps. "Gave me my crown back 
and said we were friends. Liarface."

A woodland lynx saunters away disinterestedly.

You just received message #5736 from Sibatti.

Message #5736  Sent By: Sibatti         Received On: 2/15/2012/6:11
"(( Woodland lynx don&#39;t give a fuuuuuck ))."

Kiyotan&#39;s arms unfold to tuck thumbs in the waistline of his hakama. Though his 
expression remains unchanged, the coruscating flames at his back seem to whirl 
and lash in agitation.

Sibatti turns her attention back to Moirean. "I had agreed to give you one year 
to set yourself right, with regards to your engagement. Damonicus asked for me 
to give you that much time, and that year passed its expiration a few days 
before this one. He said he spoke to you." Her tail flicks into movement, its 
feathered end brushing over the floor of the Rotunda. "I have seen nothing 
change in that time."

Pursing her lips, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "Not true. There 
is a wedding in the works. That&#39;s Change."

Sibatti snorts through her nose and glares at Moirean.

You have emoted: Lin clenches her teeth and shakes her head.

Kiyotan&#39;s chin sinks an inch toward his chest as he favors Moirean with a bored 
look of mild incredulity.

Raising her voice, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "At WHICH POINT 
I then become a Cardinalis and am privy to their plans and secrets."

Sibatti lets out a very long, very exhausted-sounding sigh through her nose, a 
hand slipping up to rub at her temple.

Moirean frowns, looking a bit perplexed. "Wait," she states. "That&#39;s not why we 
are here. This is about Lin trying to fry me!"

Moirean scrambles to her feet suddenly, smoothing wielding a dark bow. She 
narrows her eyes and draws back the string, letting out a soft, "Ziiing!" to 
imitate an arrow&#39;s flight.

Drawing her fingertips along the Heartstring, Moirean forms a silvery arrow with 
black heart for its head, and nocking it, she draws the string back, taking 
careful aim. After a moment, she releases the string and sends the arrow flying.
You are pierced by a black heart arrow that quickly dissipates into the air, 
leaving only the wound behind.

Moirean&#39;s aura of weapons rebounding disappears.

careful aim. After a moment, she releases the string and sends the arrow flying.
You are pierced by a black heart arrow that quickly dissipates into the air, 
leaving only the wound behind.
The wound to your heart proves too deep, and your back arches in pain as a 
stream of black energy pours out of you, coursing towards Moirean. When it 
dissipates, a profound emptiness fills your chest.

You say nothing at all to Moirean but let your silence speak for you.

Beaming, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "Bullseye!"

You suddenly perceive the vague outline of an aura of rebounding around Moirean.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s eyes snap toward Sibatti, her eyebrows cocked at an angle.

"Your time is up," Sibatti says to Moirean, speaking over the obnoxious din. 
"You will break it, or you will call this Pride your home no longer."

Kiyotan&#39;s eye flicks to Sibatti, then back to Moirean, his controlled features 
still a blank mask.

Moirean&#39;s attention is on the heart, poking and prodding at it in curiosity. Its 
crystalline facets glitter with a dusky gleam, their glow reflected in her 
heatlit eyes. She doesn&#39;t seem to hear the statement at first, although her ears 
twitch. Slowly, eventually, she turns her head, mouth slackjaw. Her eyes express 
a range of emotions for a brief flash, before confusion clouds her stare.

In a very, very soft, quiet voice, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, 
"Bye bye?"

You project the hallucination into the mind of Moirean.
You expected me to lose my temper.

You project the hallucination into the mind of Moirean.
Check.

"Use your words," Sibatti sighs.

Moirean rubs at her forehead with the heel of her hand and sharply sneezes. 
"Lin&#39;s in my head," she complains.

Sibatti glares angrily at you.

You have emoted: Lin responds to Sibatti with a calm, attentive look, most of 
her anger faded. "She is lying."

Moirean gapes at you, eyes widening. "Am not!" she shrilly retorts.

In a harsh growl, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "I don&#39;t
-care-."

You have emoted: "This has become a farce," Lin murmurs. She seems to no longer 
feel the need to stand straight like an Enorian soldier, and takes a sidestep to 
offer her hand to a woodland lynx, if she should wish for a sniff.

Sibatti gives Moirean a silent, expectant look, dropping her arms to her sides.

Moirean&#39;s gaze drifts back to Sibatti and then shifts over to, surprisingly, 
Kiyotan. Quietly, she begins an appeal, words coming quick. "Once upon a time 
Firelady came to the forest and told us a story. She told us about darkness and 
light and the dangers of handling each. She spoke of laws, too, which dictated 
how people should interact with enemies." She swallows heavily and her stare 
turns back to Sibatti. "Firelady told us that those laws were for children, or 
for leaders too uncertain in their own followers to trust that they could guard 
their own souls."

Sibatti clasps her hands together, fingers interlaced, her half-lidded stare set 
on Moirean. "I did trust you to guard your own soul, Moirean. I also told you 
that you were valuing spectacle over service. I do not know how I could have 
made it any clearer to you that the solution was just that simple."

Continuing, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "I have contacts, 
in both the Spires as well as among the ranks of the undead, I interface with 
and would not consider a thoroughly hated enemy. I understand completely that 
not every dealing we make is on the up-and-up."

Sibatti tilts her head a bit to one side, her ears flicking forward somewhat 
aggressively and her eyes narrowing. "But you value this &#39;show&#39;, this fireworks 
display, more than you apparently value your home in the Beacon - and they cast 
you out for it too."

Stubbornly, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "I still help them."

Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "It has never been a question 
of trust, or loyalty, but your judgment, Moirean. The fact that you continue to 
walk this line speaks more to me than any justification you can give to me. I 
consider myself an unbiased individual, and the limits of my trust are nearly 
boundless."

Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "Just because you are capable 
of doing something does not mean you should, much less that you should flaunt
it."

Moirean frowns, her head bowing. Her chin rests on her knees and she softly says,
"It&#39;s...complicated..."

You have emoted: Lin takes on an awkward mien, glancing anywhere that isn&#39;t 
Sibatti or Moirean, the talon of one foot digging into the living wood.

"Do you love him?" speaks a rumbling bass, the deep sound almost dissonant 
compared to the higher pitched tones of the conversation thus far. Kiyotan, with 
his head slightly tilted back and to one side, looks expectantly down his cheek 
at Moirean. The tone of the query is not gentle, but devoid of derision.

Moirean doesn&#39;t meet the stares of anyone present, her eyes instead fixed on the 
lynx prowling through the room. She watches the beast in silence for a long 
moment, before sighing. "No. Yes. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t this so. It&#39;s not...
romantic. It&#39;s not treasonous. We work together, often, for our Order. I value 
his knowledge, and respect him for that. He&#39;s made me stronger." She tilts her 
head upwards towards Kiyotan, eyes wide as she asks, "Is that love?"

Kiyotan&#39;s imperious stare unblinkingly remains upon Moirean, as if perhaps 
waiting for more, or reading the unspoken on her face. After an extended silence,
he finally replies: "I would not say so." His hands unhook from his pants, 
spreading apart palms-up. "You cannot work with him, value his knowledge, and 
respect his expertise without public acknowledgement of an engagement with 
him?"

Frowning, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "There is no reason to, 
then."

Kiyotan adopts a thoughtful expression, lifting his gaze upward. "&#39;For our
Order,&#39; didn&#39;t you say?"

Uncertainly, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "Yes, sometimes..."

You have emoted: Lin produces and cups her hand around a pipe, lighting it as 
discreetly as possible. Standing apart from the group, she smokes in silence, 
watching the discussion.

Moirean abruptly scrambles to her feet, shaking her head. She slices her arms 
through the air and stomps one foot. "This isn&#39;t why we are here," she says, 
ears folding inwards as if to try to block out any replies. "We&#39;re here because 
Lin is a liarface and mean and tried to kill me. I don&#39;t wanna talk about this 
anymore."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "The imp is being indulgent."

You have emoted: Lin glances pointedly at Moirean and puffs three perfect rings 
from her lips.

<<Order>>: You say, "The imp -defines- indulgent."

Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "Lin&#39;s punishment is being 
handled."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "I have grown sick of her. I liked her once. No more."

Kiyotan&#39;s eye closes and he clears his throat into a fist. "Yes," he concurs 
with Sibatti.

<<Order>>: You say, "I confess, I... was... somewhat calculating. Used her 
momentum against her to put her in this situation."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "Tell Me more."

<<Order>>: You say, "It&#39;s a very simple exchange. She&#39;s broken into my home, my 
valley, my -territory-, more times than I care to count."

<<Order>>: You say, "She did it this last time, so I attempted to cook her with 
my brain. I am very good at that. She flew off the handle. I knew, when we were 
summoned to this get-together, that if I kept quiet she would eventually make 
herself look like a damned fool."

Moirean lets out a snort and mimics the tone of Sibatti. "My decision is being 
made, then," she retorts. "I will think over my choices. Expect a decision 
around the time Lin actually sees some retribution for her actions."

You have emoted: "I see more than you can comprehend," Lin remarks softly.

"I gave you your ultimatum almost a day ago," Sibatti interjects to Moirean.

Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "And over a year to &#39;consider 
your choices.&#39;"

Moirean lifts her chin, a lopsided, Imp-sized crown wobbling atop her head, and 
gives her wings a sharp flap. "I need to think about things," she states, voice 
pitched in what is, apparently, an attempt at a regal tone.

<<Order>>: You say, "She shot at me with the little bows everyone is carrying 
around - she knew, I could tell in the flash of her eye, I would lose my temper."

<<Order>>: You say, "It would have been a disaster. A fight in front of the 
Prideleader."

<<Order>>: You say, "I felt nothing."

Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "You have one month."

Pain, frustration, sadness, anger - all flash across Moirean&#39;s features, before 
she gives a nod and schools her features into a merry, mirthful expression. Her 
lips curve into a wide smile, and she executes a jaunty salute. "Thank you for 
your patience, Prideleader," she chirps.

"Kiyotan will be handling your punishment," Sibatti says to you, the anger in 
her words not a bit faded.

Sibatti leaves to the up.

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Aledar needs an interview."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Since I can&#39;t give it now."

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "No he doesn&#39;t. He rejoined the Pride after taking 
his oath and leaving."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Fine, whatever."

(Sentinels): Moirean says, "He asked for one."

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "Aledar - you do not take an interview as a returning 
member."

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s composure takes a visible hit when Sibatti departs, a 
thick sigh gusting through her teeth. "But of course," she says, glancing at 
Kiyotan.

Moirean carefully shapes together some materials into a firework.

(Sentinels): Aledar says, "Ahhh, Thank you for the clarification."

Moirean squats down and lights a firework. As she rises, she stumbles, kicking 
against the explosive&#39;s base, so the column is facing almost directly at you.

Moirean places a sinister skull firework into the ground by its stand, preparing 
it for use.

A woodland lynx bats at a sinister skull firework playfully for a few moments.

Moirean lights the fuse on a sinister skull firework and it begins to burn down, 
making its way to the final explosion.

Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "...erk."

You have emoted: Lin braces herself, clenching her eyes shut when the incendiary 
bursts before her face. Though her claws dig into her palms and her hands 
tremble at the singing pain, she maintains her silence, shooting Moirean a weary 
glance.

With exaggerated concern, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says to you, 
"Oh, gee, are you allr--" She breaks off with a squawk, batting at the air. 
"Ack!"

    [ I believe Omei, at this point, had tossed some manner of illusion at
	  her. ]

You have emoted: "Go find something to do," Lin says.
balance | 0.86 seconds.

Her expression slipping into an angry scowl, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the 
Imps says, "Debating if murdering you counts."

Moirean rubs at her forehead again and lets out another sneeze. "And stay the 
fuck out of my head!"

Moirean pulls a hunter&#39;s spear from her weaponbelt fluidly.
Moirean begins to wield a hunter&#39;s spear in her left hand.

With a quick thrust from the butt end of a hunter&#39;s spear, Moirean knocks you to 
the ground.

Moirean scowls miserably.

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.

Moirean spits on the ground in disgust.

    [ Moirean leaves silently. ]


Omei appears, growling, Her grip tightening on Her spear.

Omei begins to wield a bloodstained hunter&#39;s spear in Her left hand.

Omei cocks back Her bloody spear, sighting carefully along its length before 
flinging it skyward.
A hunter&#39;s spear materializes in Omei&#39;s hands, its point glistening with 
recently-drawn blood.
Omei snarls viciously.

Moths peeling away from Her one by one, Omei dissolves, She and the moths 
vanishing into thin air in a burst of riotous purple.

You have emoted: Lin staggers back a step, thrilling with fear and awe. "Mother--"

Blinking rapidly, you say, "I was never in her head."

The fire at Kiyotan&#39;s back spins and whips into a violent whorl at the 
appearance--and subsequent disappearance--of the Goddess. Lips drawn into a thin 
line, he stiffly gestures for you to follow as he stalks northward. Not needing 
a command, Lansyr follows at his heels.

You begin to follow Kiyotan.

You follow Kiyotan to the north.


    [ When suddenly... ]


(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Fine, screw it."

(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "And there she goes."

2012/02/15 07:22:08 - Sibatti ousted Moirean from the position of secretary.
2012/02/15 07:22:16 - Sibatti put Moirean on probation.
2012/02/15 07:26:45 - Sibatti dismissed Moirean as an aide to the novices.
2012/02/15 07:32:59 - Moirean quit the guild.'>[ Moirean tried prisming into Lin's home, her valley, to shoot at
her with her Heartstring Bow. When Lin threatened her over it, she
instead tried to prism to Keshena, who was in a different room in
her home. ]
You tell Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained, "Moirean is repeatedly
attempting to break into my home in Eleusis. I want to know what I can do about
this."
Sibatti tells you, "I envision a day when I am not perpetually handling children."
You tell Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained, "Well, I would not be
allowed to cast her as an enemy of the Council, so what I must essentially do is
figure out how to fend off someone stronger than me from entering my place."
You tell Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained, "I am sorry if this
inconveniences you."
[ Lin is derping around Delos --> Enorian --> Heartwood but eventually
comes to say 'hi' to her in person. ]
The Sanctuary. (Ancient Heartwood.) (17048)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Birds of every sort flutter about
their beautiful garden of herbs, flowers, and berries. A large fountain stands
central in the sanctuary, and pours water into a pool that gently flows out onto
the waiting plants. Many perches made of stout wood have been fastened to every
available surface, providing ample spaces for the birds to roost. Earthenware
bowls and oaken pots lie about, filled to overflowing with seeds and grain to
feed the birds. Benches are scattered about in no particular order, providing
places for the birds' admirers to sit and chat. An Eleusian ranger stands guard,
her hand resting on the hilt of her sword. A small, cheery sapling sits here,
its leaves a stunning green, and its blossoms a soothing white. Armed with a
javelin, an Eleusian peltast keeps watch for invaders. A dark brown root sigil
is here. The regal Heartwood stag grazes on the forest foliage. Esrytesh Sibatti
dur Naya, the Unrestrained is here.
Exits: down and in (closed pine door).
The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds.
The shadows fade, leaving your footfalls audible once again.
Seated on a high perch, you say, "I'm sorry, I've woken in a vicious mood. If it
was anyone else I would not have minded so much."
Sibatti crosses her arms and glances up at you, her ears skewed at an angle none
too pleasant. She only gives you a look, mildly frustrated.
You have emoted: Lin glances once at Sibatti, then pointedly looks away,
lighting and tending to a thin pipe, jutting from her teeth like an errant
feather in a bird's plumage. "I do not know what that look means, Esry."
"It means I am in no mood to be ...." Sibatti uncrosses her arms hastily and
reaches into her things for a wineskin, uncorking its stop.
Sibatti tips an impressed leather wineskin with serged seams back and draws a
mouthful of the aged cachaca.
Swallowing, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "Light. Gentle.
Compassionate, or ... any of the things I should be."
You have emoted: Lin lifts from her perch, her face flashing with anger. "I'm
not in the mood to--" she clenches her teeth, and swallows her words, sinking
back into a relaxed position. "I didn't come here to argue with you about
anything. I just wanted company."
Sibatti sits in a swift movement on the edge of the stone fountain, her
shoulders drawn back and the arch of her back harsh. Her brows are angled
sharply downward, and she takes another sip from her wineskin. "I won't be very
good company," she warns, a low rumble in her voice. Her voice quiets, adding,
"I haven't had a few good months."
You have emoted: Lin stays on her perch, in view of Sibatti slightly from above,
but she shifts into an upright sitting position, her legs dangling from the edge.
Tendrils of smoke waft from the bowl of her pipe. "There is just... so much I
don't know. I- I wanted to know how you and -he- were doing. I wanted to... help,
in any way I could, I suppose as a means of proving that his torment is not my
fault."
You have emoted: "And because it is a good thing to do, I suppose," Lin mutters.
Sibatti snorts in reply, tipping her nose up and running the palm of her hand
over her hair, fingertips catching onto her ears and tugging them backwards. She
seems more inclined to drink than to answer.
Sibatti tips an impressed leather wineskin with serged seams back and draws a
mouthful of the aged cachaca.
Her voice low, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "At least now I
know what really happened, as bitter as it makes me feel. I can't even get to
the point where I can talk about it without feeling angry - and that's the best
part of it all."
You have emoted: "You are angry," Lin says, "And I am in a foul mood. Perhaps it
would be best if I left you alone for a little while."
Sibatti turns her head to view you in her peripherals, not looking any more
agreeable than when the conversation started. "Perhaps."
You have emoted: Lin pinches the bridge of her nose. The bough she was sitting
on flings into the air dangerously as she comes to land on the Sanctuary terrace,
her eyes set dead ahead with a weary look as she leaves.
Duiran Council Chambers. (Ancient Heartwood.) (17019)
Armed with a javelin, an Eleusian peltast keeps watch for invaders. A carven bit
of stone has been shaped and etched with runic symbols here, standing vigil over
the whole of the Heartwood. Wandering hand fingering a throwing knife, a
wilderness scout keeps watch on activity in the area. A long ornate table is
here, 5 strange oak chairs placed at it. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A dark brown root sigil is here.
Exits: west (open oak door) and up (closed pine door).
You close the door to the west.
[ Lin goes to the Council Chamber just to hang out. Moirean opens
the door repeatedly, which Lin closes right away, but she gets
shot twice. She tries to go back to her home instead, when... ]
You are pierced by a black heart arrow that quickly dissipates into the air,
leaving only the wound behind.
The wound to your heart proves too deep, and your back arches in pain as a
stream of black energy pours out of you, coursing towards Moirean. When it
dissipates, a profound emptiness fills your chest.
[ Lin heads down to her valley at last. She is now overreacting.
(Mind Radiance) ]
You bow your head, and concentrate on preparing a channel for your mental power.
You focus your mind, allowing the image of Moirean to form a picture within your
mind's eye.
Moirean has left the area.
Your victim is not close enough for you to finish.
Moirean is out of range of your telepathy, and the mental cords between you snap
instantly.
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Lin. Seriously, radiancing me?"
(Sentinels): You say, "I will not indulge you the way others do."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Radiancing Pridemates is not wise."
(Sentinels): You say, "I will also not argue with you about it here."
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "If you two have a dispute, you resolve it with
Sacrament. I don't want to hear about it in -any- other fashion."
(Sentinels): You say, "I just said I would not argue about it."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "You can't just try to kill a Pridemate and then
decide you don't want to talk about it."
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "Lin, you know our law."
(Sentinels): You say, "I wlll not threaten, attack or slay another member of the
Pride outside of the Sacrament of Enmity."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "I am waiting."
--> sense Moirean
An image of Within a broken circle of faded crimson appears in your mind.
(20158)
From your knowledge, that room is in (Ancient Heartwood.)
[ This is our 'arena room' and a chamber we use for the Sacrament
of Enmity, which is what two Sentinels who just can't get along
go through. ]
(Sentinels): You say, "I take issue with this."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "You tried to kill me. I don't think you are in the
position to take issue."
(Sentinels): You say, "And I wish to know if I will be listened to and taken
seriously, or if the current climate of the day will keep me from being heard."
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "You are both in the wrong. You initiate the
Sacrament by speaking to me, as it is scribed."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "How am I in the wrong?"
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "I just said it."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "No, explain it."
(Sentinels): You say, "You broke into my goddamned home, Imp!"
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, ""You initiate the Sacrament by speaking to me"."
(Sentinels): You say, "AGAIN!"
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "When I was told that was your house, I ceased going
there."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "I have been doing my goddamn best to behave and
cater to your childish whims and whines, but trying to KILL me is a line you've
crossed that I will not ignore."
(Sentinels): You say, "There is no Sacrament. I do not respect you as a Sentinel.
If the Prideleader wishes to punish me instead, I will accept that."
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "For the love of.."
(Sentinels): Nadia says, "This conversation does not being here."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "You are the aggressor and broke the guild laws. You
don't get to pick your punishment."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Sibatti, I think you are sufficiently informed at
this point of, at least on my part, the intent for the sacrament."
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "Not another word here. I will see you both in the
Rotunda."
--> --> -->
A determined look upon her face, Minsja points her spear at the ground directly
under your feet. Her eyes radiate with wild power briefly as you feel the ground
fall away from under your feet.
Suspended mid-air only momentarily, gravity does its work and you plummet
downward only to land agilely on your feet on the Rotunda below.
The Rotunda. (Ancient Heartwood.) (20151)
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A
woodland lynx prowls here, eyes darting with scarcely contained ferocity.
Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Silent and
observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of
the eye. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Nervously pacing,
a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of night
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. Fangs extended,
a venomous forest snake slithers here. A cloaked figure is riding on a donkey.
She wields a vicious dark brown dhurive in her hands. Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya,
the Unrestrained is here.
Exits: north, east, southeast (open pine door), south (open pine door),
southwest, west, up (open pine door), and down (open pine door).
Lifting her chin, A cloaked figure says, "I was at the circle."
Sibatti's eyes glow a faint red as she briefly closes them.
Wiping your face of emotion, you place both feet shoulder-width apart and then
shift your hands behind your back. Arranging them so the right settles above the
left, you keep them flat as a board and stare straight at Sibatti.
Your pose is now set as: Lin is here, standing straight with stiffened hands
settled behind her back.
Moirean gives a cheerful yellow tulip to Sibatti.
"I didn't realize there was so little happening in the world that we have the
time and the energy to expend on so much -bullshit-," Sibatti snarls, her voice
befitting the angered growl of a feral cat.
You have emoted: Lin's eyes narrow reactively but she says nothing.
Crossing her arms over her chest, A cloaked figure says, "Don't include me in
this "we." I am the one attacked here - and I respected guild laws and did not
simply slay her in return."
Kiyotan plummets in from above, landing agilely on his feet.
A cloaked figure raises an eyebrow, frowning, as a look of genuine confusion
crosses her face. "I'm honestly uncertain why -I- am getting your ire," she
pouts. "I'm OBEYING the laws. Not killing people." Her pout shifts to a scowl
and she scuffs at the floor in a short kick. "...and still get yelled at..."
Sibatti's gaze swings sharply over to A cloaked figure, her fury not even
lessened one bit. "You respect this law, but I'm still entertaining your
bullshit with that 'Mad Mage' of Bloodloch," retorts.
A cloaked figure raises her hands in protest. "So EVERYTHING I do will be
colored by that?" she squawks.
Her voice raising, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "You will
not presume to tell ME to 'leave you out' of my statement."
A cloaked figure impatiently shoves back the hood of her cloak with the heel of
her hand, her snarl of curls bouncing free in a messy wave of crimson.
Moirean deftly lowers the hood of a cloak of obscurity, revealing her identity.
You have emoted: Lin's eyes flicker over to Kiyotan, to whom she offers a
passing glance, a friendly nod, before returning her attention to the matter at
hand.
Moirean's stare remains fixed on Sibatti, glowering. Her arms cross across her
chest and, taking in her height, slight frame and the lopsided crown askew on
her head, it's fairly hard not to connect her image at this moment with that of
a petulant child.
"You're -both- wrong, for two different reasons," Sibatti continues, her tone
sharp. She slips her arms behind her back and entwines them.
In a grumbling mutter, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "Followed
the rules."
How the huge wolf upon which Kiyotan sits astride managed to stealthily sneak in
will remain a mystery. Out of the shadow the beast prowls, and the Yeleni slips
off his back. He stands beside Sibatti, a deferential pace behind. His single
visible eye shifts between the assembled women, his face an expressionless mask.
Arms remain folded across a bare torso.
Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says to you, "Taking out your rage
in such an unrefined and bloodthirsty manner is shameful, and ill-befitting of
this Pride."
You have emoted: Lin's chest expands in a single, deep breath, the most she has
moved in several minutes. "I agree," she says quietly.
Kiyotan gracefully hops off of a massive arctic wolf.
"I don't know--" Sibatti squeezes her eyes shut, looking suddenly exasperated,
and takes a deep breath. "I don't -care- what petty issues you have going on
between you - gods knows they take priority over those -dismissible- things like
oath and service in these parts lately - but you NEVER fracture the unity of
this Pride with your hackneyed solutions."
Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says to Her Highness, Queen Moirean
of the Imps, "Lin said she told you twice to stop, before I even said a word to
you."
You have emoted: "Not counting when she did this exact thing a few years ago,"
Lin mutters.
Moirean's scowl deepens. "I didn't even KNOW I had an issue with Lin," she
protests. "She said stay out of her house, so I stopped travelling to her.
Apparently Keshena also lives there? I didn't know it was the same residence."
She turns to you and adds, "...and Ingram said I was invited in as a guest when
I "intruded" before. Yell at HIM, not me."
You have emoted: At this, Lin returns to her prior silence, meeting Moirean's
accusations with only a steady gaze.
Sibatti quirks an eyebrow at you, her voice lowered in volume but still heavy
with tension. "You could not get these details from her -before- you deemed it
an unresolvable issue?"
You have emoted: "I know the details," Lin replies. "She has not explained the
-exact- details."
Moirean promptly plops into a seat on the floor, arms still crossed over her
chest. "Dunno why you even hate me suddenly," she grumps. "Gave me my crown back
and said we were friends. Liarface."
A woodland lynx saunters away disinterestedly.
You just received message #5736 from Sibatti.
Message #5736 Sent By: Sibatti Received On: 2/15/2012/6:11
"(( Woodland lynx don't give a fuuuuuck ))."
Kiyotan's arms unfold to tuck thumbs in the waistline of his hakama. Though his
expression remains unchanged, the coruscating flames at his back seem to whirl
and lash in agitation.
Sibatti turns her attention back to Moirean. "I had agreed to give you one year
to set yourself right, with regards to your engagement. Damonicus asked for me
to give you that much time, and that year passed its expiration a few days
before this one. He said he spoke to you." Her tail flicks into movement, its
feathered end brushing over the floor of the Rotunda. "I have seen nothing
change in that time."
Pursing her lips, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "Not true. There
is a wedding in the works. That's Change."
Sibatti snorts through her nose and glares at Moirean.
You have emoted: Lin clenches her teeth and shakes her head.
Kiyotan's chin sinks an inch toward his chest as he favors Moirean with a bored
look of mild incredulity.
Raising her voice, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "At WHICH POINT
I then become a Cardinalis and am privy to their plans and secrets."
Sibatti lets out a very long, very exhausted-sounding sigh through her nose, a
hand slipping up to rub at her temple.
Moirean frowns, looking a bit perplexed. "Wait," she states. "That's not why we
are here. This is about Lin trying to fry me!"
Moirean scrambles to her feet suddenly, smoothing wielding a dark bow. She
narrows her eyes and draws back the string, letting out a soft, "Ziiing!" to
imitate an arrow's flight.
Drawing her fingertips along the Heartstring, Moirean forms a silvery arrow with
black heart for its head, and nocking it, she draws the string back, taking
careful aim. After a moment, she releases the string and sends the arrow flying.
You are pierced by a black heart arrow that quickly dissipates into the air,
leaving only the wound behind.

Moirean's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.

careful aim. After a moment, she releases the string and sends the arrow flying.
You are pierced by a black heart arrow that quickly dissipates into the air,
leaving only the wound behind.
The wound to your heart proves too deep, and your back arches in pain as a
stream of black energy pours out of you, coursing towards Moirean. When it
dissipates, a profound emptiness fills your chest.
You say nothing at all to Moirean but let your silence speak for you.
Beaming, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "Bullseye!"
You suddenly perceive the vague outline of an aura of rebounding around Moirean.
You have emoted: Lin's eyes snap toward Sibatti, her eyebrows cocked at an angle.
"Your time is up," Sibatti says to Moirean, speaking over the obnoxious din.
"You will break it, or you will call this Pride your home no longer."
Kiyotan's eye flicks to Sibatti, then back to Moirean, his controlled features
still a blank mask.
Moirean's attention is on the heart, poking and prodding at it in curiosity. Its
crystalline facets glitter with a dusky gleam, their glow reflected in her
heatlit eyes. She doesn't seem to hear the statement at first, although her ears
twitch. Slowly, eventually, she turns her head, mouth slackjaw. Her eyes express
a range of emotions for a brief flash, before confusion clouds her stare.
In a very, very soft, quiet voice, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says,
"Bye bye?"
You project the hallucination into the mind of Moirean.
You expected me to lose my temper.
You project the hallucination into the mind of Moirean.
Check.
"Use your words," Sibatti sighs.
Moirean rubs at her forehead with the heel of her hand and sharply sneezes.
"Lin's in my head," she complains.
Sibatti glares angrily at you.
You have emoted: Lin responds to Sibatti with a calm, attentive look, most of
her anger faded. "She is lying."
Moirean gapes at you, eyes widening. "Am not!" she shrilly retorts.
In a harsh growl, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "I don't
-care-."
You have emoted: "This has become a farce," Lin murmurs. She seems to no longer
feel the need to stand straight like an Enorian soldier, and takes a sidestep to
offer her hand to a woodland lynx, if she should wish for a sniff.
Sibatti gives Moirean a silent, expectant look, dropping her arms to her sides.
Moirean's gaze drifts back to Sibatti and then shifts over to, surprisingly,
Kiyotan. Quietly, she begins an appeal, words coming quick. "Once upon a time
Firelady came to the forest and told us a story. She told us about darkness and
light and the dangers of handling each. She spoke of laws, too, which dictated
how people should interact with enemies." She swallows heavily and her stare
turns back to Sibatti. "Firelady told us that those laws were for children, or
for leaders too uncertain in their own followers to trust that they could guard
their own souls."
Sibatti clasps her hands together, fingers interlaced, her half-lidded stare set
on Moirean. "I did trust you to guard your own soul, Moirean. I also told you
that you were valuing spectacle over service. I do not know how I could have
made it any clearer to you that the solution was just that simple."
Continuing, Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "I have contacts,
in both the Spires as well as among the ranks of the undead, I interface with
and would not consider a thoroughly hated enemy. I understand completely that
not every dealing we make is on the up-and-up."
Sibatti tilts her head a bit to one side, her ears flicking forward somewhat
aggressively and her eyes narrowing. "But you value this 'show', this fireworks
display, more than you apparently value your home in the Beacon - and they cast
you out for it too."
Stubbornly, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "I still help them."
Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "It has never been a question
of trust, or loyalty, but your judgment, Moirean. The fact that you continue to
walk this line speaks more to me than any justification you can give to me. I
consider myself an unbiased individual, and the limits of my trust are nearly
boundless."
Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "Just because you are capable
of doing something does not mean you should, much less that you should flaunt
it."
Moirean frowns, her head bowing. Her chin rests on her knees and she softly says,
"It's...complicated..."
You have emoted: Lin takes on an awkward mien, glancing anywhere that isn't
Sibatti or Moirean, the talon of one foot digging into the living wood.
"Do you love him?" speaks a rumbling bass, the deep sound almost dissonant
compared to the higher pitched tones of the conversation thus far. Kiyotan, with
his head slightly tilted back and to one side, looks expectantly down his cheek
at Moirean. The tone of the query is not gentle, but devoid of derision.
Moirean doesn't meet the stares of anyone present, her eyes instead fixed on the
lynx prowling through the room. She watches the beast in silence for a long
moment, before sighing. "No. Yes. I don't know. I don't this so. It's not...
romantic. It's not treasonous. We work together, often, for our Order. I value
his knowledge, and respect him for that. He's made me stronger." She tilts her
head upwards towards Kiyotan, eyes wide as she asks, "Is that love?"
Kiyotan's imperious stare unblinkingly remains upon Moirean, as if perhaps
waiting for more, or reading the unspoken on her face. After an extended silence,
he finally replies: "I would not say so." His hands unhook from his pants,
spreading apart palms-up. "You cannot work with him, value his knowledge, and
respect his expertise without public acknowledgement of an engagement with
him?"
Frowning, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "There is no reason to,
then."
Kiyotan adopts a thoughtful expression, lifting his gaze upward. "'For our
Order,' didn't you say?"
Uncertainly, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "Yes, sometimes..."
You have emoted: Lin produces and cups her hand around a pipe, lighting it as
discreetly as possible. Standing apart from the group, she smokes in silence,
watching the discussion.
Moirean abruptly scrambles to her feet, shaking her head. She slices her arms
through the air and stomps one foot. "This isn't why we are here," she says,
ears folding inwards as if to try to block out any replies. "We're here because
Lin is a liarface and mean and tried to kill me. I don't wanna talk about this
anymore."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "The imp is being indulgent."
You have emoted: Lin glances pointedly at Moirean and puffs three perfect rings
from her lips.
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "The imp -defines- indulgent."
Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "Lin's punishment is being
handled."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "I have grown sick of her. I liked her once. No more."
Kiyotan's eye closes and he clears his throat into a fist. "Yes," he concurs
with Sibatti.
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "I confess, I... was... somewhat calculating. Used her
momentum against her to put her in this situation."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "Tell Me more."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "It's a very simple exchange. She's broken into my home, my
valley, my -territory-, more times than I care to count."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "She did it this last time, so I attempted to cook her with
my brain. I am very good at that. She flew off the handle. I knew, when we were
summoned to this get-together, that if I kept quiet she would eventually make
herself look like a damned fool."
Moirean lets out a snort and mimics the tone of Sibatti. "My decision is being
made, then," she retorts. "I will think over my choices. Expect a decision
around the time Lin actually sees some retribution for her actions."
You have emoted: "I see more than you can comprehend," Lin remarks softly.
"I gave you your ultimatum almost a day ago," Sibatti interjects to Moirean.
Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "And over a year to 'consider
your choices.'"
Moirean lifts her chin, a lopsided, Imp-sized crown wobbling atop her head, and
gives her wings a sharp flap. "I need to think about things," she states, voice
pitched in what is, apparently, an attempt at a regal tone.
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "She shot at me with the little bows everyone is carrying
around - she knew, I could tell in the flash of her eye, I would lose my temper."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "It would have been a disaster. A fight in front of the
Prideleader."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "I felt nothing."
Esrytesh Sibatti dur Naya, the Unrestrained says, "You have one month."
Pain, frustration, sadness, anger - all flash across Moirean's features, before
she gives a nod and schools her features into a merry, mirthful expression. Her
lips curve into a wide smile, and she executes a jaunty salute. "Thank you for
your patience, Prideleader," she chirps.
"Kiyotan will be handling your punishment," Sibatti says to you, the anger in
her words not a bit faded.
Sibatti leaves to the up.
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Aledar needs an interview."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Since I can't give it now."
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "No he doesn't. He rejoined the Pride after taking
his oath and leaving."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Fine, whatever."
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "He asked for one."
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "Aledar - you do not take an interview as a returning
member."
You have emoted: Lin's composure takes a visible hit when Sibatti departs, a
thick sigh gusting through her teeth. "But of course," she says, glancing at
Kiyotan.
Moirean carefully shapes together some materials into a firework.
(Sentinels): Aledar says, "Ahhh, Thank you for the clarification."
Moirean squats down and lights a firework. As she rises, she stumbles, kicking
against the explosive's base, so the column is facing almost directly at you.
Moirean places a sinister skull firework into the ground by its stand, preparing
it for use.
A woodland lynx bats at a sinister skull firework playfully for a few moments.
Moirean lights the fuse on a sinister skull firework and it begins to burn down,
making its way to the final explosion.
Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says, "...erk."

You have emoted: Lin braces herself, clenching her eyes shut when the incendiary
bursts before her face. Though her claws dig into her palms and her hands
tremble at the singing pain, she maintains her silence, shooting Moirean a weary
glance.
With exaggerated concern, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the Imps says to you,
"Oh, gee, are you allr--" She breaks off with a squawk, batting at the air.
"Ack!"
[ I believe Omei, at this point, had tossed some manner of illusion at
her. ]
You have emoted: "Go find something to do," Lin says.
balance | 0.86 seconds.
Her expression slipping into an angry scowl, Her Highness, Queen Moirean of the
Imps says, "Debating if murdering you counts."
Moirean rubs at her forehead again and lets out another sneeze. "And stay the
fuck out of my head!"
Moirean pulls a hunter's spear from her weaponbelt fluidly.
Moirean begins to wield a hunter's spear in her left hand.
With a quick thrust from the butt end of a hunter's spear, Moirean knocks you to
the ground.
Moirean scowls miserably.
You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.
Moirean spits on the ground in disgust.
[ Moirean leaves silently. ]
Omei appears, growling, Her grip tightening on Her spear.
Omei begins to wield a bloodstained hunter's spear in Her left hand.
Omei cocks back Her bloody spear, sighting carefully along its length before
flinging it skyward.
A hunter's spear materializes in Omei's hands, its point glistening with
recently-drawn blood.
Omei snarls viciously.
Moths peeling away from Her one by one, Omei dissolves, She and the moths
vanishing into thin air in a burst of riotous purple.
You have emoted: Lin staggers back a step, thrilling with fear and awe. "Mother--"
Blinking rapidly, you say, "I was never in her head."
The fire at Kiyotan's back spins and whips into a violent whorl at the
appearance--and subsequent disappearance--of the Goddess. Lips drawn into a thin
line, he stiffly gestures for you to follow as he stalks northward. Not needing
a command, Lansyr follows at his heels.
You begin to follow Kiyotan.
You follow Kiyotan to the north.
[ When suddenly... ]
(Sentinels): Moirean says, "Fine, screw it."
(Sentinels): Sibatti says, "And there she goes."
