He used to lose the ability to manifest without constant support from the MC Ritual, so perhaps the loss of that and the division of his essence has caused him to be inable to manifest otherwise."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "To see if it was a portal."

Haldrin gestures wildly, pointing uselessly in a southern direction. "The Ascendril are not having this issue. As of right now, that crystal is worth as much as a shattered one. I am almost certain this has something to do with the shadow plane. The eyes, as well as the fact that the Ascendril who rely on spirit are not having a problem at all with theirs. I would much rather do superficial damage to this crystal to figure out answers then let those of the Shadowplane escape."

<<Sciomancers>>: Cariv says, "But that&#39;s all entirely speculation."

Ishin chuckles long and heartily.

<<Sciomancers>>: Cariv says, "Albeit founded on presumably accurate information."

<<Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "Maybe you should make the post."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara, "You have an unhealthy obsession with the Shadow Plane."

<<Sciomancers>>: Cariv says, "No thanks. Be well."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara, "You should let it relax, before it reaches out and eats you."

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says to Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "I am morbidly curious."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara, "You would be curious no more if they did."

Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel says to Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "I&#39;ll write a book about the Plane."

Ishin stares coldly at Haldrin.

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "Not much to fear there. We wield the shadows, after all."

Vralen shakes his head at Haldrin.

Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel says, "Oh no."

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "That isn&#39;t to say we wouldn&#39;t fight left and right."

Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel says, "That&#39;s were we are wrong."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "That&#39;s where you are dead wrong."

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "But it would be an adventure worth writing about."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "You should be terrified of it."

Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso says, "I think that if anyone were to give the &#39;go ahead&#39; for something as silly as opening up the crystal, it&#39;d be at a time where the Shadow Warden could be present. Then again, I also vote against opening it up."

Vralen ponders the situation.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Let&#39;s just leave it right now."

Vralen sits down on an oak armchair.

Ishin turns his head towards the crystal. He steps in close and extends a hand towards it. "Say that again," he whispers.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I think we should go out and study."

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says to Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "There is much I should be terrified of, Sir. But I have learned that terror is a useless emotion. It clouds judgement and it dulls reflexes. Terror is as much a cause of death as what one is terrified of."

Orisae tilts her head and listens intently.

You say, "Cariv has asked me to act with the Crystal&#39;s best interest in mind in the absence of our Shadow Warden. We will not be doing anything irreversible or potentially permanent."

Vralen turns to #ishin with a curious expression on his face.

Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso asks Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Did you hear something?"

You murmur to Ishin, "You heard something? I thought I did earlier, but... I shrugged it off."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "We are all done here."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "It&#39;s not going to give anymore clues as of now."

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "You go. I am keeping a watch on it."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "We have clues already."

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "You have my word I will not cause any harm to it."

Ishin moves in closer yet to the crystal. He rests a hand lightly on it, the other lifting to push his goggles up as he rests an ear gently on the smooth surface. "Once more," he urges.

Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso says, "Might I suggest that we continue our watch of the Crystal."

Haldrin sits down on an oak armchair.

Vralen walks up to the Master Crystal and sits down in front of it cross-legged and with closed eyes. He places his voidstaff across his lap and listens intently to Ishin.

You chew thoughtfully on your lip.

Orisae furrows her brow in consternation.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I believe it is done for this month giving out clues."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "And acting up."

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "I believe the best course would be locking the guildhall up tight and keeping watch."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "It&#39;s pretty much dead right now."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "The answer is not here."

Nodding, Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara, "That&#39;s what we were doing earlier."

Vralen ponders Laikahra&#39;s profile, deep in consideration.

Ishin laughs softly. "Sometimes," he says in an agreeable tone. "Tell me what I can do to help?"

Vralen stares implacably at Ishin.

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says to Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso, "You misunderstand. Lock that door up. So none can enter or leave."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "No one can refine or do anything to that effect."

Haldrin stares at Ishin and blinks.

Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel exclaims, "Everyone!"

Vralen points off into the wild blue yonder.

Vralen points accusingly at a dark Master Crystal.

You have emoted: Arkhe quirks an eyebrow at Ishin, her chin jutting out slightly.

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "It wants you all to leave."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "All that can be done now is study and letting everyone know that we cannot crystalhome nor refine."

Orisae gives a pained sigh.

Orisae leaves to the up.

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "I&#39;m afraid what -it- wants is not necessarily the top of my concerns."

Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel asks Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Who is to stay?"

You say to Haldrin, "Fortunately, it overrules you."

Ishin taps the crystal lightly. "Who do you want to stay? Me?"

Vralen looks hopefully at the Crystal.

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says to you, "Except we have no real proof the crystal is saying anything."

Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara, "Ishin is not insane...err."

(Sciomancers): Orisae says, "Left."

Vralen peers about himself suspiciously.

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "I never said insane."

Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel mutters, "I thin. .. isn&#39;t."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "No, I&#39;m quite insane. But I would not lie about something that would negatively effect my Citadel."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Doesn&#39;t matter. I am vice gm. I say EVERYONE out."

You say to Haldrin, "I&#39;ll believe in the words of my own fiance. He wouldn&#39;t dare play me."

The corners of Vralen&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

Glowering, you say to Ishin, "Right?"

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "Arkhe, come here. The rest of you leave."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I don&#39;t care what ishin has to say."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "But I do care about what I have to say."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "And I say out."

Ishin turns, offering a hand to you.

Vralen leaves to the up.

(House Cardinalis): Ishin says, ""...tender..." is the only word you can discern from the whispers, the rest is rendered inaudible by the inane chatter of the present Sciomancers."

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says to Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "It is ridiculous to not leave a watch!"

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara, "GET OUT."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I am here."

You have emoted: Arkhe steps gently into Ishin&#39;s grasp, giving Laikahra a solemn nod.

Vralen arrives from the up.

Vralen spins his fingers in the air.

Ishin keeps his eyes locked on Haldrin as he guides your hand to the crystal. "Speak with it, beloved," he murmurs.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "You want to help then go see if that other mc portal stands."

(Sciomancers): Orisae says, "Is anything happening?"

(Sciomancers): Laikahra says, "Nope."

(Sciomancers): Laikahra says, "It&#39;s done for now."

Haldrin grips his staff tightly, planting it firmly on the ground. "I do not trust this at all. No offense Mr. Ishin, but that Crystal is quite important. I do not deem myself important enough for it to speak to me, but I want a clear sign if it wants me out."

The crystal remains pointedly inert.

(Sciomancers): Laikahra says, "Just go study and see about the ascendrils mc and see if that old portal still stands."

Haldrin ponders a dark Master Crystal&#39;s profile, deep in consideration.

Laikahra thwaps Ishin on the head.

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "That is about as much of a sign as I would have expected..."

Haldrin bows respectfully to a dark Master Crystal.

Ishin begins to advance on Haldrin slowly. "Leave," he states again, his voice as cold as the air outside. "Laikahra has told you, and the crystal has spoken that it desires the Tender."

Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel sadly says, "Tralendar."

Vralen nods his head at Laikahra.

Vralen pats a dark Master Crystal in a friendly manner.

Vralen leaves to the up.

A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.

Just as coldly, Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says to Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Leave I shall. But do me the favor of not coming off as threatening."

You have emoted: Arkhe&#39;s palm touches lightly into the smoky surface of the Master. She frowns, glancing once over her shoulder at the remaining Sciomancers. Exhaling a long, slow breath, she ignores the rest of the room and focuses quietly.

Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara says, "Be well."

Haldrin leaves to the up.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Sheesh."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "That boy."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I know he is trying to be helpful."

Ishin moves back over near you, and places a gentle hand on your shoulder in support.

You have emoted: "Your whisper was drowned amidst the noise..." Arkhe&#39;s frown deepens, glancing up at the Master Crystal. She places her other hand along a deep vein tentatively, before holding it there with renewed confidence.

Laikahra raises an eyebrow questioningly.

A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says to you, "Any idea who is being held in there?"

The Master Crystal remains conspicuously silent.

Ishin nudges Laikahra suggestively.

Ishin points straight up.

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "It just wants her."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to you, "I&#39;ll be above if you need me."

You think for a moment before nodding slowly at Ishin.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I am not going anywhere."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "But yes you go."

A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I am acting gm. I am not going anywhere."

You have emoted: A sharp tooth pierces Arkhe&#39;s lip fretfully, her small frame shuddering as another beam shoots out.

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "See?"

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "Laikahra, we need to leave."

You follow Ishin to the up.
Nexus of Elemental Magics. (Spinesreach.)
Sitting on a sculptured pedestal is a journal titled &#39;Spirit Section and Guild favour Information&#39;. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A large granite statue stands here, depicting a mage fighting imaginary foes. Leaning calmly on his staff, a Guardian of the Master Crystals stands here. Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve&#39;kahi, Nimir&#39;e Mashara is here. He wields a black voidstaff in his left hand. Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso is here. She wields a black voidstaff in her left hand and a tower shield in her right. Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel is here. He wields a black voidstaff in his left hand. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and up.

Ishin moves over to block the down exit.

Ishin lashes out with his whip and drags Laikahra into the room.

Ishin stops you from moving that way.

Haldrin raises an eyebrow questioningly.

You peer about yourself suspiciously.

Ishin tells you, "Tumble."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I am not leaving her alone."

You begin to tumble agilely to the down.

You tumble out of the room, escaping your predicament.
The Crystal Garden. (Spinesreach.)
There are 5 Magus guards here. A Master Crystal, darkened by smoky veins, stands before you. Down the middle of the Crystal, a solid stream of pure Earth and Air has been fashioned, filling in a large crack offending the Crystal. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing tall, an oak chair with an ouroboros carved into its back sits here.
There are no obvious exits.

You have emoted: Arkhe straightens herself, nearly losing her balance coming out of her tumble.

You mutter discontentedly.

A pair of red eyes appear within the depths of the Master Crystal, accompanied by a faint, exasperated whisper. "Finally," it says. The eyes roll accordingly.

You have emoted: Brushing her skirt off, Arkhe moves into the depression to stand before the Master Crystal once more. "They care much," she murmurs.

A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room.

Laikahra suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.

A whip comes speeding in, wraps itself around Laikahra and drags her off.

You chew thoughtfully on your lip.

You have emoted: "Or maybe they doubt my ability," Arkhe adds with a roll of her eyes.

A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room.

Laikahra suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.

A whip comes speeding in, wraps itself around Laikahra and drags her off.

A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.

You have emoted: Arkhe takes a deep breath and stands within arm&#39;s length of the Master. Her hands linger briefly near where the crack begins to separate the crystal, her expression thoughtful. "You asked for me?" she speaks into the pyramid.

"Much of my memory is clouded, obscured, lost as I languish in this neglected incarceration," the voice whispers finally, "I cannot recall your face. Have I met? Did I know you?"

The red eyes within the crystal watch you intently.

You have emoted: "Who?" Arkhe inquires, keeping her voice to a minimum level. "I.. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m quite young. If you&#39;ve been here for awhile, you would not recognize me."

You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "Please reassure them. The Master wished to speak to me alone, and it was difficult for them to leave me."

"Nevithor," the voice answers, "and it appears I have been trapped in this crystalline prison long enough for fools to overrun our Guild. How many centuries have passed? Where is the Shadow Mark?"

Ishin tells you, "Please tell Laikahra to fuck off."

<<Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "Arkhe."

<<Sciomancers>>: You say, "Yes?"

Ishin tells you, "They&#39;re talking about guild enemying me and shit."

<<Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "I am about to go off on your fiance."

<<Sciomancers>>: You say, "I.. where is the Shadow Mark?"

<<Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "You better get him out of this guildhall."

<<Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "I mean it."

<<Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "I mean like right now."

(Sciomancers): Vralen says, "We are together in this."

<<Sciomancers>>: You say, "Please?"

<<Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "Or else all hell is going to break loose."

(Sciomancers): Vralen says, "Keep united. Be strong."

You have emoted: Arkhe takes a small step back, taking in the crystal&#39;s breadth. "It is the year 310, Nevithor."

(Sciomancers): Vralen says, "Oh gods..."

You have emoted: "And..." Arkhe wrings her hands together with a small wince. "I&#39;m afraid I have never heard of the Shadow Mark."

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "War is about to break out in this guildhall. get him out of here."

<Sciomancers>: You say, "If he leaves, will you allow me to speak to the Master as it has requested.. alone?"

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "Just get him out."

You tell Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "I have this, love."

Ishin tells you, "All right."

You tell Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Best not anger them further."

Ishin tells you, "Tell the rest to stop tryin to enter?"

You tell Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "I have asked so."

Ishin tells you, "Haldrin in particular. He&#39;s about to get a nasty awakening."

"You are distracted," the voice observes, "why?"

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "I will fully leave the realms. just get him out of our guild hall."

You have emoted: A soft, fluid breath escapes from Arkhe&#39;s lips. "They are persistent," she grumbles, glancing toward the stair.

A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.

"Who possesses the Shadow Mark?" the voice inquires again.
                       
You tell Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "Ma&#39;am - the Shadow Mark. It requests information on where it is, or who holds it. What is this Mark?"

(Sciomancers): Vralen says, "That&#39;s an Order from the Protector of the Mark, Haldrin."

Laikahra tells you, "I would help but your fiance won&#39;t allow me in the room."

You tell Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "I am unsure it will continue to speak."

Kerryn tells you, "Do you require Laik&#39;s help?"

You have emoted: "I..." Arkhe falters in her reply.

You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "I am not sure. The Master requested a private meeting."

A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.

You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "But it wants to know where the Shadow Mark is."

A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.

"Bring me that other whom I addressed," the voice commands, "servant to the Lord of Shadow."

You tell Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Come here."

Laikahra tells you, "I am so frustrated."

You have emoted: Arkhe nods quietly.

Ishin walks in, his stride cold and muscles tense. "You called, beloved," he asks, moving next to you.

Laikahra tells you, "I want him out."

"Where is the Shadow Mark?" the voice commands, issuing forth from the Master Crystal and the red eyes within.

Laikahra tells you, "He just called me all kinds of names and attacked me."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "I don&#39;t have an actual item called a &#39;Shadow Mark&#39;. It is, however, a technique I have developed for use upon others."

Laikahra tells you, "Out of my guildhall."

A frustrated growl echoes through the chamber, coupled with another bolt of shadow, leaping forth from the crack in the Master Crystal. The projectile collides harmlessly with the chamber wall.

<Sciomancers>: You say, "Things are going to get very ugly... it did not like the lack of answer."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "Describe the Shadow Mark to me? Perhaps I have seen it."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "It seems too much similar to my technique for it to simply be coincidence. Though, it could of course be."

You let loose a long breath from your lungs, exhaling slowly.

"It was given to the Shadow Warden," the voice explains slowly, clearly struggling to maintain its composure. "Who holds it now? Who commands the Sciomancers? As this tide of uneducated fools washes over the Guild, who has the mob chosen to govern?"

Quickly, you say, "Mazzion."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "Mazzion Cardinalis."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "An Ankyrean."

The red eyes glare out at you from the crystal, but soften as soon as you speak. "This is good news," it whispers.

Laikahra arrives from the up.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Am I going to get pulled out again?"

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "For the love of Severn, get the Pit out."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "Gods."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "It wants to speak to us, not you."

Ishin lifts a hand, resting it over his face in frustration.

You have emoted: Arkhe glances frantically to the crack within the Master, slightly fearful.

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I think it&#39;s in the desert."

Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Where the old portal was at."

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "Get him out of my guildhall."

<Sciomancers>: You say, "It requested him."

Laikahra leaves to the up.

Ishin shakes his head.

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "I don&#39;t really care."

Ishin gives a pained sigh.

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "Haha. and he just asked me where the old portal was."

You have emoted: "I&#39;m going to catch hell for this later..." Arkhe mutters.

The ghost of a smile passes fleetingly across the lips of Ishin.

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "It isn&#39;t your fault she&#39;s stubborn and petty."

<Sciomancers>: Kerryn says, "We need to listen to what the Crystal wants."

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "One minute after he asked me to leave."

"Both of you be silent," the voice commands harshly.

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "He asked me where the old portal was."

<Sciomancers>: Kerryn says, "We&#39;ll sort the rest of his mess out after."

Ishin inclines his head slightly, lifting a hand to rest it on your shoulder.

You have emoted: Arkhe&#39;s hands clasp together in front of her, attempting to keep her composure.

Ishin tells you, "Be strong, beloved."

Ishin tells you, "Do not fear it, respect it."

<Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "I see some favors and some disfavors coming all around."

"I trust you have at least the sense to notice what has become of the Master Crystal," the voice states tiredly, pausing to await affirmation.

You have emoted: Arkhe nods crisply.

Ishin nods his head emphatically.

Kerryn tells you, "Whats it wanting?"

"I will try to be brief," the voice whispers now, more quietly than before. "I waited years, evidently, for the Sciomancers to devise a method to allow me to manifest physically, but to no avail."

You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "Silence, for now. It.. he.. is irritated."

Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "And for that, you need the Mark."

You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "So .. we are waiting in silence."

Kerryn tells you, "What does it want?"

You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "Um.. it is Nevithor."

Ishin tilts his head curiously.

Kerryn tells you, "Ahh.. what does he want?"

"More that I wanted to be certain you foolish children had not given it to someone unfit," it clarifies.

Kerryn tells you, "How can I help?"

You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "I think he wants the Shadow Mark."

Kerryn tells you, "What or who is it?"

Ishin nods slightly, then tilts his head, continuing to listen.

You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "I am trying to learn more about that now."

"The Master Crystal and I are connected, just as it and I are connected to your Lord," the voice explains, growing weaker, overtly strained as it speaks.

You have emoted: Arkhe glances furtively at Ishin and takes a few steps closer to the Master as the voice grows quieter.

A dark Master Crystal settles down in a corner to sleep.

Ishin follows you, nodding again.

Ishin tells you, "Maybe ask what we can do to help, beloved?"

You hear faint whispers, but the words escape your ears.

Ishin steps in closer to the crystal, once more pressing his ear against it. He gestures for you to do the same.

You have emoted: Arkhe approaches the crystal quickly, stepping before the vertical crack and straining to listen.

Kerryn tells you, "Have a feeling, Laik&#39;s going to have our heads...."

The crystal falls silent and the eyes vanish.

You say, "Nevithor.. I would pass on to the Warden how we may fix this.. I."

You pointedly say nothing at all.

Ishin purses his lips pensively, gazing thoughtfully at some distant point.'>&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Cariv says, "If it's what I assume, he's been trapped within or his soul has been divided in some way. He used to lose the ability to manifest without constant support from the MC Ritual, so perhaps the loss of that and the division of his essence has caused him to be inable to manifest otherwise."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "To see if it was a portal."
Haldrin gestures wildly, pointing uselessly in a southern direction. "The Ascendril are not having this issue. As of right now, that crystal is worth as much as a shattered one. I am almost certain this has something to do with the shadow plane. The eyes, as well as the fact that the Ascendril who rely on spirit are not having a problem at all with theirs. I would much rather do superficial damage to this crystal to figure out answers then let those of the Shadowplane escape."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Cariv says, "But that's all entirely speculation."
Ishin chuckles long and heartily.
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Cariv says, "Albeit founded on presumably accurate information."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "Maybe you should make the post."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara, "You have an unhealthy obsession with the Shadow Plane."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Cariv says, "No thanks. Be well."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara, "You should let it relax, before it reaches out and eats you."
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says to Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "I am morbidly curious."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara, "You would be curious no more if they did."
Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel says to Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "I'll write a book about the Plane."
Ishin stares coldly at Haldrin.
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "Not much to fear there. We wield the shadows, after all."
Vralen shakes his head at Haldrin.
Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel says, "Oh no."
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "That isn't to say we wouldn't fight left and right."
Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel says, "That's were we are wrong."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "That's where you are dead wrong."
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "But it would be an adventure worth writing about."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "You should be terrified of it."
Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso says, "I think that if anyone were to give the 'go ahead' for something as silly as opening up the crystal, it'd be at a time where the Shadow Warden could be present. Then again, I also vote against opening it up."
Vralen ponders the situation.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Let's just leave it right now."
Vralen sits down on an oak armchair.
Ishin turns his head towards the crystal. He steps in close and extends a hand towards it. "Say that again," he whispers.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I think we should go out and study."
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says to Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "There is much I should be terrified of, Sir. But I have learned that terror is a useless emotion. It clouds judgement and it dulls reflexes. Terror is as much a cause of death as what one is terrified of."
Orisae tilts her head and listens intently.
You say, "Cariv has asked me to act with the Crystal's best interest in mind in the absence of our Shadow Warden. We will not be doing anything irreversible or potentially permanent."
Vralen turns to #ishin with a curious expression on his face.
Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso asks Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Did you hear something?"
You murmur to Ishin, "You heard something? I thought I did earlier, but... I shrugged it off."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "We are all done here."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "It's not going to give anymore clues as of now."
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "You go. I am keeping a watch on it."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "We have clues already."
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "You have my word I will not cause any harm to it."
Ishin moves in closer yet to the crystal. He rests a hand lightly on it, the other lifting to push his goggles up as he rests an ear gently on the smooth surface. "Once more," he urges.
Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso says, "Might I suggest that we continue our watch of the Crystal."
Haldrin sits down on an oak armchair.
Vralen walks up to the Master Crystal and sits down in front of it cross-legged and with closed eyes. He places his voidstaff across his lap and listens intently to Ishin.
You chew thoughtfully on your lip.
Orisae furrows her brow in consternation.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I believe it is done for this month giving out clues."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "And acting up."
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "I believe the best course would be locking the guildhall up tight and keeping watch."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "It's pretty much dead right now."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "The answer is not here."
Nodding, Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara, "That's what we were doing earlier."
Vralen ponders Laikahra's profile, deep in consideration.
Ishin laughs softly. "Sometimes," he says in an agreeable tone. "Tell me what I can do to help?"
Vralen stares implacably at Ishin.
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says to Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso, "You misunderstand. Lock that door up. So none can enter or leave."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "No one can refine or do anything to that effect."
Haldrin stares at Ishin and blinks.
Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel exclaims, "Everyone!"
Vralen points off into the wild blue yonder.
Vralen points accusingly at a dark Master Crystal.
You have emoted: Arkhe quirks an eyebrow at Ishin, her chin jutting out slightly.
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "It wants you all to leave."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "All that can be done now is study and letting everyone know that we cannot crystalhome nor refine."
Orisae gives a pained sigh.
Orisae leaves to the up.
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "I'm afraid what -it- wants is not necessarily the top of my concerns."
Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel asks Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Who is to stay?"
You say to Haldrin, "Fortunately, it overrules you."
Ishin taps the crystal lightly. "Who do you want to stay? Me?"
Vralen looks hopefully at the Crystal.
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says to you, "Except we have no real proof the crystal is saying anything."
Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara, "Ishin is not insane...err."
(Sciomancers): Orisae says, "Left."
Vralen peers about himself suspiciously.
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "I never said insane."
Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel mutters, "I thin. .. isn't."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "No, I'm quite insane. But I would not lie about something that would negatively effect my Citadel."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Doesn't matter. I am vice gm. I say EVERYONE out."
You say to Haldrin, "I'll believe in the words of my own fiance. He wouldn't dare play me."
The corners of Vralen's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
Glowering, you say to Ishin, "Right?"
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "Arkhe, come here. The rest of you leave."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I don't care what ishin has to say."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "But I do care about what I have to say."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "And I say out."
Ishin turns, offering a hand to you.
Vralen leaves to the up.
(House Cardinalis): Ishin says, ""...tender..." is the only word you can discern from the whispers, the rest is rendered inaudible by the inane chatter of the present Sciomancers."
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says to Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "It is ridiculous to not leave a watch!"
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara, "GET OUT."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I am here."
You have emoted: Arkhe steps gently into Ishin's grasp, giving Laikahra a solemn nod.
Vralen arrives from the up.
Vralen spins his fingers in the air.
Ishin keeps his eyes locked on Haldrin as he guides your hand to the crystal. "Speak with it, beloved," he murmurs.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "You want to help then go see if that other mc portal stands."
(Sciomancers): Orisae says, "Is anything happening?"
(Sciomancers): Laikahra says, "Nope."
(Sciomancers): Laikahra says, "It's done for now."
Haldrin grips his staff tightly, planting it firmly on the ground. "I do not trust this at all. No offense Mr. Ishin, but that Crystal is quite important. I do not deem myself important enough for it to speak to me, but I want a clear sign if it wants me out."
The crystal remains pointedly inert.
(Sciomancers): Laikahra says, "Just go study and see about the ascendrils mc and see if that old portal still stands."
Haldrin ponders a dark Master Crystal's profile, deep in consideration.
Laikahra thwaps Ishin on the head.
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "That is about as much of a sign as I would have expected..."
Haldrin bows respectfully to a dark Master Crystal.
Ishin begins to advance on Haldrin slowly. "Leave," he states again, his voice as cold as the air outside. "Laikahra has told you, and the crystal has spoken that it desires the Tender."
Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel sadly says, "Tralendar."
Vralen nods his head at Laikahra.
Vralen pats a dark Master Crystal in a friendly manner.
Vralen leaves to the up.
A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.
Just as coldly, Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says to Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Leave I shall. But do me the favor of not coming off as threatening."
You have emoted: Arkhe's palm touches lightly into the smoky surface of the Master. She frowns, glancing once over her shoulder at the remaining Sciomancers. Exhaling a long, slow breath, she ignores the rest of the room and focuses quietly.
Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara says, "Be well."
Haldrin leaves to the up.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Sheesh."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "That boy."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I know he is trying to be helpful."
Ishin moves back over near you, and places a gentle hand on your shoulder in support.
You have emoted: "Your whisper was drowned amidst the noise..." Arkhe's frown deepens, glancing up at the Master Crystal. She places her other hand along a deep vein tentatively, before holding it there with renewed confidence.
Laikahra raises an eyebrow questioningly.
A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says to you, "Any idea who is being held in there?"
The Master Crystal remains conspicuously silent.
Ishin nudges Laikahra suggestively.
Ishin points straight up.
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "It just wants her."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to you, "I'll be above if you need me."
You think for a moment before nodding slowly at Ishin.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I am not going anywhere."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "But yes you go."
A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I am acting gm. I am not going anywhere."
You have emoted: A sharp tooth pierces Arkhe's lip fretfully, her small frame shuddering as another beam shoots out.
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "See?"
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "Laikahra, we need to leave."
You follow Ishin to the up.
Nexus of Elemental Magics. (Spinesreach.)
Sitting on a sculptured pedestal is a journal titled 'Spirit Section and Guild favour Information'. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A large granite statue stands here, depicting a mage fighting imaginary foes. Leaning calmly on his staff, a Guardian of the Master Crystals stands here. Shadow Adept, Haldrin Ve'kahi, Nimir'e Mashara is here. He wields a black voidstaff in his left hand. Shadow Adept, Orisae Adesso is here. She wields a black voidstaff in her left hand and a tower shield in her right. Shadow Adept Vralen Castiel is here. He wields a black voidstaff in his left hand. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and up.
Ishin moves over to block the down exit.
Ishin lashes out with his whip and drags Laikahra into the room.
Ishin stops you from moving that way.
Haldrin raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You peer about yourself suspiciously.
Ishin tells you, "Tumble."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I am not leaving her alone."
You begin to tumble agilely to the down.
You tumble out of the room, escaping your predicament.
The Crystal Garden. (Spinesreach.)
There are 5 Magus guards here. A Master Crystal, darkened by smoky veins, stands before you. Down the middle of the Crystal, a solid stream of pure Earth and Air has been fashioned, filling in a large crack offending the Crystal. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing tall, an oak chair with an ouroboros carved into its back sits here.
There are no obvious exits.
You have emoted: Arkhe straightens herself, nearly losing her balance coming out of her tumble.
You mutter discontentedly.
A pair of red eyes appear within the depths of the Master Crystal, accompanied by a faint, exasperated whisper. "Finally," it says. The eyes roll accordingly.
You have emoted: Brushing her skirt off, Arkhe moves into the depression to stand before the Master Crystal once more. "They care much," she murmurs.
A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room.
Laikahra suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.
A whip comes speeding in, wraps itself around Laikahra and drags her off.
You chew thoughtfully on your lip.
You have emoted: "Or maybe they doubt my ability," Arkhe adds with a roll of her eyes.
A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room.
Laikahra suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.
A whip comes speeding in, wraps itself around Laikahra and drags her off.
A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.
You have emoted: Arkhe takes a deep breath and stands within arm's length of the Master. Her hands linger briefly near where the crack begins to separate the crystal, her expression thoughtful. "You asked for me?" she speaks into the pyramid.
"Much of my memory is clouded, obscured, lost as I languish in this neglected incarceration," the voice whispers finally, "I cannot recall your face. Have I met? Did I know you?"
The red eyes within the crystal watch you intently.
You have emoted: "Who?" Arkhe inquires, keeping her voice to a minimum level. "I.. I'm afraid I'm quite young. If you've been here for awhile, you would not recognize me."
You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "Please reassure them. The Master wished to speak to me alone, and it was difficult for them to leave me."
"Nevithor," the voice answers, "and it appears I have been trapped in this crystalline prison long enough for fools to overrun our Guild. How many centuries have passed? Where is the Shadow Mark?"
Ishin tells you, "Please tell Laikahra to fuck off."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "Arkhe."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: You say, "Yes?"
Ishin tells you, "They're talking about guild enemying me and shit."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "I am about to go off on your fiance."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: You say, "I.. where is the Shadow Mark?"
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "You better get him out of this guildhall."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "I mean it."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "I mean like right now."
(Sciomancers): Vralen says, "We are together in this."
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: You say, "Please?"
&lt;&lt;Sciomancers>>: Laikahra says, "Or else all hell is going to break loose."
(Sciomancers): Vralen says, "Keep united. Be strong."
You have emoted: Arkhe takes a small step back, taking in the crystal's breadth. "It is the year 310, Nevithor."
(Sciomancers): Vralen says, "Oh gods..."
You have emoted: "And..." Arkhe wrings her hands together with a small wince. "I'm afraid I have never heard of the Shadow Mark."
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "War is about to break out in this guildhall. get him out of here."
&lt;Sciomancers>: You say, "If he leaves, will you allow me to speak to the Master as it has requested.. alone?"
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "Just get him out."
You tell Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "I have this, love."
Ishin tells you, "All right."
You tell Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Best not anger them further."
Ishin tells you, "Tell the rest to stop tryin to enter?"
You tell Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "I have asked so."
Ishin tells you, "Haldrin in particular. He's about to get a nasty awakening."
"You are distracted," the voice observes, "why?"
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "I will fully leave the realms. just get him out of our guild hall."
You have emoted: A soft, fluid breath escapes from Arkhe's lips. "They are persistent," she grumbles, glancing toward the stair.
A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.
"Who possesses the Shadow Mark?" the voice inquires again.
You tell Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "Ma'am - the Shadow Mark. It requests information on where it is, or who holds it. What is this Mark?"
(Sciomancers): Vralen says, "That's an Order from the Protector of the Mark, Haldrin."
Laikahra tells you, "I would help but your fiance won't allow me in the room."
You tell Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "I am unsure it will continue to speak."
Kerryn tells you, "Do you require Laik's help?"
You have emoted: "I..." Arkhe falters in her reply.
You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "I am not sure. The Master requested a private meeting."
A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.
You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "But it wants to know where the Shadow Mark is."
A beam of elemental power shoots randomly out from the crack in the Master Crystal, dissipating as it collides with the walls of the chamber.
"Bring me that other whom I addressed," the voice commands, "servant to the Lord of Shadow."
You tell Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis, "Come here."
Laikahra tells you, "I am so frustrated."
You have emoted: Arkhe nods quietly.
Ishin walks in, his stride cold and muscles tense. "You called, beloved," he asks, moving next to you.
Laikahra tells you, "I want him out."
"Where is the Shadow Mark?" the voice commands, issuing forth from the Master Crystal and the red eyes within.
Laikahra tells you, "He just called me all kinds of names and attacked me."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "I don't have an actual item called a 'Shadow Mark'. It is, however, a technique I have developed for use upon others."
Laikahra tells you, "Out of my guildhall."
A frustrated growl echoes through the chamber, coupled with another bolt of shadow, leaping forth from the crack in the Master Crystal. The projectile collides harmlessly with the chamber wall.
&lt;Sciomancers>: You say, "Things are going to get very ugly... it did not like the lack of answer."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "Describe the Shadow Mark to me? Perhaps I have seen it."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "It seems too much similar to my technique for it to simply be coincidence. Though, it could of course be."
You let loose a long breath from your lungs, exhaling slowly.
"It was given to the Shadow Warden," the voice explains slowly, clearly struggling to maintain its composure. "Who holds it now? Who commands the Sciomancers? As this tide of uneducated fools washes over the Guild, who has the mob chosen to govern?"
Quickly, you say, "Mazzion."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "Mazzion Cardinalis."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "An Ankyrean."
The red eyes glare out at you from the crystal, but soften as soon as you speak. "This is good news," it whispers.
Laikahra arrives from the up.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Am I going to get pulled out again?"
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "For the love of Severn, get the Pit out."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "Gods."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says to Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis, "It wants to speak to us, not you."
Ishin lifts a hand, resting it over his face in frustration.
You have emoted: Arkhe glances frantically to the crack within the Master, slightly fearful.
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "I think it's in the desert."
Mother Mage, Laikahra Cardinalis says, "Where the old portal was at."
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "Get him out of my guildhall."
&lt;Sciomancers>: You say, "It requested him."
Laikahra leaves to the up.
Ishin shakes his head.
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "I don't really care."
Ishin gives a pained sigh.
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "Haha. and he just asked me where the old portal was."
You have emoted: "I'm going to catch hell for this later..." Arkhe mutters.
The ghost of a smile passes fleetingly across the lips of Ishin.
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "It isn't your fault she's stubborn and petty."
&lt;Sciomancers>: Kerryn says, "We need to listen to what the Crystal wants."
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "One minute after he asked me to leave."
"Both of you be silent," the voice commands harshly.
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "He asked me where the old portal was."
&lt;Sciomancers>: Kerryn says, "We'll sort the rest of his mess out after."
Ishin inclines his head slightly, lifting a hand to rest it on your shoulder.
You have emoted: Arkhe's hands clasp together in front of her, attempting to keep her composure.
Ishin tells you, "Be strong, beloved."
Ishin tells you, "Do not fear it, respect it."
&lt;Sciomancers>: Laikahra says, "I see some favors and some disfavors coming all around."
"I trust you have at least the sense to notice what has become of the Master Crystal," the voice states tiredly, pausing to await affirmation.
You have emoted: Arkhe nods crisply.
Ishin nods his head emphatically.
Kerryn tells you, "Whats it wanting?"
"I will try to be brief," the voice whispers now, more quietly than before. "I waited years, evidently, for the Sciomancers to devise a method to allow me to manifest physically, but to no avail."
You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "Silence, for now. It.. he.. is irritated."
Ishin "Old Fogey" Cardinalis says, "And for that, you need the Mark."
You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "So .. we are waiting in silence."
Kerryn tells you, "What does it want?"
You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "Um.. it is Nevithor."
Ishin tilts his head curiously.
Kerryn tells you, "Ahh.. what does he want?"
"More that I wanted to be certain you foolish children had not given it to someone unfit," it clarifies.
Kerryn tells you, "How can I help?"
You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "I think he wants the Shadow Mark."
Kerryn tells you, "What or who is it?"
Ishin nods slightly, then tilts his head, continuing to listen.
You tell Invoker of Shadow, Kerryn Cardinalis-Lunare, "I am trying to learn more about that now."
"The Master Crystal and I are connected, just as it and I are connected to your Lord," the voice explains, growing weaker, overtly strained as it speaks.
You have emoted: Arkhe glances furtively at Ishin and takes a few steps closer to the Master as the voice grows quieter.
A dark Master Crystal settles down in a corner to sleep.
Ishin follows you, nodding again.
Ishin tells you, "Maybe ask what we can do to help, beloved?"
You hear faint whispers, but the words escape your ears.
Ishin steps in closer to the crystal, once more pressing his ear against it. He gestures for you to do the same.
You have emoted: Arkhe approaches the crystal quickly, stepping before the vertical crack and straining to listen.
Kerryn tells you, "Have a feeling, Laik's going to have our heads...."
The crystal falls silent and the eyes vanish.
You say, "Nevithor.. I would pass on to the Warden how we may fix this.. I."
You pointedly say nothing at all.
Ishin purses his lips pensively, gazing thoughtfully at some distant point.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
