[37mYou have emoted: [33mIsto beckons out to one of the padded dummies, calling, [1;36m"Come here, Ethen."[0;33m A little blonde boy with blue eyes waddles out and plops itself down in his lap. [1;36m"I hope you two don&#39;t [0m[1;36mmind my son sitting in, do you?"[0;33m he asks Arbre and Zeva.[0m

[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "You have been mortal long enough to spawn?"[0m

[33mZeva shakes her head slightly.[0m

[1;36mRunning his hands over the boy&#39;s head gently, you say to Arbre, "A few years, now, actually. Part of the reason I went living. He&#39;s about one and a half."[0m

[1;36m"Mm,"[0;33m Arbre intones apathetically, [1;36m"I rather assumed you got the cure for about the same reasons I did. I was surprised in your wife&#39;s following the example. But I digress. I imagine you wanted [0m[1;36mto speak of my intentions."[0m

[37mYou have emoted: [33mThe little boy points out at Zeva, murmuring gently [1;36m"Wulf."[0;33m Isto replies softly, [1;36m"Yes, Ethen, a wolf."[0;33m He settles the little boy comfortably in his lap before he nods his head at [0m[33mArbre. [1;36m"I know what it&#39;s like to carry the burden of one&#39;s past mistakes. I hope that your attaining the Cure and joining us is a sign of your attempt to do so. I hear only rumor, as we&#39;ve not [0m[1;36mhad many interactions. And I would really like to give you this opportunity, the same I was given."[0;33m he rumbles.[0m

[1;36mYou say, "Perhaps I wasn&#39;t clear. In your joining us and attaining the Cure, I hope it is a sign of you trying to rectify any possible misconceptions or mistakes."[0m

[33mArbre nods curtly at you. [1;36m"I like to think I have put things back together well as can be since my rather large blunder five or six decades ago,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"still fine tuning out the details, but [0m[1;36mI have learned loyalty, if that is your insinuation."[0m

[1;36mSpreading his hands in a mollifying before settling them around the boy in his lap, you say to Arbre, "I&#39;m not trying to imply anything. I&#39;m trying to give you an opportunity. You attained our [0m[1;36mclass through the lawless and unloyal action of a previous member, one whom I understand you still interact with."[0m

[32mYou tell Lupine Arbre Aquila, "((gesture. Sorry, I just woke not long ago.))"[0m

[32mYou tell Timber Wolf, Fang Zeva, Rout Guardian, "((gesture. Sorry, I just woke not long ago.))"[0m

[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "I do. I would have joined the Rout proper when I first returned from Duiran, only I landed myself on Osifer&#39;s shit-list for him, oh, kidnapping my child."[0m

[33mArbre rolls her shoulders in a shrug. [1;36m"I wanted to be a wolf, badly. That was the only way I could,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"when Doyen changed hands, I began heckling Xentor about allowing me to join the [0m[1;36mguild. Took me some time to put my priorities in order, but here I am."[0m

[1;36mCuriously, you ask, "And do you still spend time with Aren?"[0m

[32mArbre tells you, "(( I assumed as much. The typo part, I mean. I don&#39;t stalk you. I promise. ))"[0m

[32mYou tell Lupine Arbre Aquila, "(( >.> ))"[0m

[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "I do. His qualms with the Rout are his own - I do not agree with his bullheaded attitude, but what can I do of it?"[0m

[32mZeva tells you, "((Heh, that is alright.))"[0m

[1;36mYou say, "I&#39;m afraid that I will recommend you cease numerous face-to-face interactions. He will remain an enemy to the guild until such a time as he can demonstrate a change in attitude. This is [0m[1;36mfor -your- benefit, that you might make the most of this opportunity."[0m

[1;30mThe following members of the Atabahi are in the realm:[0m
[33mMember         Rank                          Position       Class[0m
[34m----------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
[1;30mIsto           the Doyen                     Guildmaster    Lycanthrope[0m
[1;30mZeva           a Rout Guardian               Secretary      Lycanthrope[0m
[1;30mArbre          a Lupine                                     Lycanthrope[0m

[33mArbre nods curtly at you. [1;36m"In my own defense, I had no idea he was enemied until my promotion. My opinion is that he paid for his crimes in blood to Xentor&#39;s specifications, I do not see why he [0m[1;36mshould remain an enemy. I also think that the GUILD ENEMIES privilege should be lowered to the first rank, if you wish for whelps and such to know who to avoid,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"both are my own [0m[1;36mopinions, to be taken as you will, obviously."[0m

[33mYou have emoted: Isto nods his head in understanding. [1;36m"I haven&#39;t gotten that far to look into the privileges, but I will do so. Thank you for pointing it out. As far as his enemy status goes, I [0m[1;36menemied him only just recently based upon his previous actions. Having been slain does not seem to have tempered his attitude, and I am not Xentor. I have given him the opportunity to resolve [0m[1;36mthis peacefully, but until such a time as I believe him to no longer be a threat to our family he will remain an enemy."[0;33m he replies. He reaches up to ruffle his hair a little, nose wrinkling [0m[33min thought before he adds, [1;36m"Note that I did not request you cut ties or complete contact, merely limit your public interactions so that you, and the Rout, are not harmed merely by association."[0m

[33mArbre nods to you. [1;36m"Aren has been irritating the piss out of me lately anyways,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"for much the same reasons you just stated. He and I have a rocky history, at best."[0m

[1;36mGrinning mischievously, you say, "Well, you have an excuse now that will perhaps limit confrontation on your part if you wish it."[0m

[33mZeva lowers her muzzle to the ground slowly, after a moment or two she lays down on her stomach.[0m

[33mYou have emoted: Isto shifts his body as the young boy clambers about his lap, trying to get comfortable before settling against his torso and plopping a thumb in his mouth. His nose wrinkles not [0m[33munlike his father&#39;s before his eyes begin to close ever so slowly.[0m

[1;36mYou say to Arbre, "Putting all that aside, I would like to know any reason you might wish to divulge about your change in heart, along with any plans you have for the future."[0m

[33mArbre twists her lips up slightly, real humor beginning to show. [1;36m"I agree with you on his inappropriate behavior towards the Rout, for what it is worth,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"not sure I agree that it is [0m[1;36menemy-status-worth, but that is a less important statement."[0;33m She shifts her weight, sprawling her legs out to one side. She eyes the child distastefully for a moment, but makes no comment of [0m[33mit, drawing her eyes back up to you again.[0m

[1;36mA chuckle breaking into his voice, you say, "We shall see, shan&#39;t we?"[0m

[1;36m"I do not intend to violently overthrow the Rout,"[0;33m Arbre offers in an almost irritated tone, [1;36m"I do everything I can for the betterment of myself and the organizations I am in. If I find [0m[1;36mleadership lacking and feel it is both a detriment and that I can do better, I step up. I had no time to make a strong opinion of Xentor, and less of you."[0m

[1;36mOnce more schooling his tone and resting his hands upon his knees, you say, "I&#39;m not implying anything, Arbre. I just know from my own experience that it took quite a kick in my ass to spur a [0m[1;36mchange. I do not know the depths of your mistakes and I&#39;m not overly interested - they are your own. I want to know why you chose to change. And if you work hard, as I&#39;ve no doubt you will, [0m[1;36myou will be given every opportunity any other trusted Rout member is."[0m

[33mArbre nods curtly, seeming to accept your reply. [1;36m"I will speak freely to you as your position requires it,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"that being said, I should prefer it if this conversation goes no further."[0;33m [0m[33mShe raises a brow at you, flicking her eyes once to Zeva.[0m

[33mZeva drawls lazily, &#39;I can leave if you like,&#39; her eyes half closed.[0m

[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "I have no problem with you hearing, Ceburi. I have issue with it being repeated."[0m

[1;36mYou say to Arbre, "Zeva&#39;s as tight-lipped as they go."[0m

[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "And I assume yourself as well, Doyen?"[0m

[1;36mYou say to Arbre, "Of course."[0m

[1;30mYou have emoted: [0;33mThe young boy starts within Isto&#39;s lap, slowing pushing himself out and onto his feet. He reaches back, only to pull forth a plush decapitated head doll, dragging it along the [0m[33mground by its food as he waddles over towards Zeva. [1;36m"Wulf."[0;33m he intones imperiously, holding out a hand towards Zeva&#39;s head.[0m

[33mArbre nods curtly to you. [1;36m"I did not want to become undead when I came back from the forests,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"tallied rather long on it, until it became my only option. Desian Arcan was the one [0m[1;36mjudging me worthy or no, and you know how he is. I am the product of one of his assorted sperm donations, so he was worse with me."[0;33m She pauses a moment, coughing and breathing in quickly. She [0m[33mcatches her breath and composes herself, continuing as if there were no interruption. [1;36m"Eventually the blood also became my only option. I was never particularly happy there."[0m

[33mZeva moves her head slowly towards the little boys hand.[0m

[33mYou have emoted: Isto nods his head gently in understanding. [1;36m"I, of all people, know the depths of Desian&#39;s... actions. And I certainly know the helpless feeling that leads to taking the Blood."[0;33m [0m[33mhe replies softly before falling silent once more.[0m

[37mYou have emoted: [33mTurning his head to keep Zeva and Ethen in the corner of his eye, Isto watches silently as Ethen reache out and runs a hand very gently over Zeva&#39;s snout and down over her head. [0m[33mHe drops the decapitated doll down in front of her before falling forward on his hands, legs refusing to bend too far past his hips. Getting frustrated, he merely rolls himself over onto his [0m[33mbottom before leaning back against Zeva&#39;s shoulder, patting her forepaw. [1;36m"Wulf."[0m

[33mArbre&#39;s eyes trail over to the child and Zeva, lingering there for a long moment. After a time, she seems to regain her attention, and draws it back over to you. [1;36m"I was hesitant of taking the [0m[1;36mcure, it is true,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"but most of that was in regards to my sire. Once that was solved away, a lingering fear of death and -"[0;33m She cuts herself off at the child&#39;s speech. [1;36m"Zeva,"[0;33m she [0m[33msounds out for him slowly, [1;36m"the wolf&#39;s name is Zeva."[0m

[33mZeva smiles slowly at the little boy, watching him out of the corner of her half closed eye.[0m

[37mYou have emoted: [33mIsto can&#39;t help but smile as Ethen chirps tiredly, [1;36m"Se-ffa."[0;33m He pats Zeva&#39;s forepaw once more as if comforting her. Half turning, he buries his face into her fur and begins to [0m[33mdoze once more. [1;36m"I&#39;m proud you chose to bear your fears, Arbre. What was the other, or were the others?"[0;33m he murmurs soothingly.[0m

[1;36m"Bwuh?"[0;33m Arbre says, drawing her attention back to you. She looks at you confused for a moment before your words clear her mind. [1;36m"Fears? I assume you mean with living again,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"that is as [0m[1;36mfar into the subject I am going to go, at least. Silly mortal things make me nervous. Breathing air, not breathing water, stuff you do not have to think of when undead. The sun makes me more [0m[1;36mnervous now than it did when I was blooded, and I have no logical explanation for that one. That is about it."[0;33m She relaxes passively for a moment before widening her eyes, clearly remembering [0m[33msomething. [1;36m"I am used to picking and choosing whom I like as lovers,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"now I have to remember to be a bit more discerning."[0m

[37mYou have emoted: [33mIsto dips his head towards the now sleeping boy resting against Zeva as he chuckles, [1;36m"Can be a bit of a pickle."[0;33m and winks at Arbre.[0m

[37mYou bestow your guildfavour on Lupine Arbre Aquila.[0m

[1;36m"Thank you for being more intuitive than anyone else I have made that comment to,"[0;33m Arbre says, grumbling, but clearly not directed at you, [1;36m"I adopted two and borne one. Something like three too [0m[1;36mmany daughters for me."[0m

[1;36mSuddenly and quite sheepishly rubbing the back of his neck, you say, "I&#39;ve adopted uh... three girls, two boys. Of them, only two have been strong enough to be named Cardinalis. I had two boys [0m[1;36mprevious, as well, but I.. uh."[0m

[33mYou have emoted: Isto swallows hard, eyes glued to the sleeping boy before continuing softly, [1;36m"I crushed their skulls in my hands. He... he is different."[0m

[1;36m"Mm, guildfavor for being both beautiful and witty?"[0;33m Arbre says, clearly unaffected by your revelation, [1;36m"not being able to read the logs is irksome. Xavin said something when we first discussed [0m[1;36mme taking the swim about me bearing him a son. I find the idea repulsive."[0m

[33mZeva&#39;s eyes fly open and she looks at you before murmuring, &#39;You what?&#39; Careful to not wake the sleeping boy.[0m

[37mYou have emoted: [33mIsto&#39;s face goes immediately blank as he meets Zeva&#39;s gaze with an unreadable one of his own. [1;36m"I crushed their skulls in my hands after retrieving them from the Luminaries. Their [0m[1;36mmother sought to hide them from me to punish me, and by that time I could not stand what they stood for, who their mother was or what they were being turned into. So I crushed their skulls and [0m[1;36mstabbed out the eyes of the Luminary guildmistress and her wife. Many, many years ago."[0;33m he replies before nodding to Arbre. [1;36m"The directive tasks lists one Pack as Family. I stated, and I [0m[1;36mquote, It is important to be honest with one another. We have nothing if we do not have trust, and the desire to admit and rectify our mistakes. Thank you, Arbre."[0m

[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "I am drowning in slices as well. If it were me, I might offer some reward for placement in the current hunt. That might be a self-serving statement however."[0m

[1;36mWith newfound, if grim, humor, you say to Zeva, "Funny. My current wife is the one who brought them to the Luminaries."[0m

[33mYou purse your lips pensively, gazing off into the distance as you carefully gather your thoughts.[0m

[1;36mYou say to Arbre, "Good idea, thank you. I was going to ask, as well - you have experience in running shops?"[0m

[33mArbre furrows her brow. [1;36m"Aithene was never Luminary,"[0;33m she draws out, clearly uncertain, [1;36m"and I would rather claw out my own eyeballs than run a shop. I used to help stock house, order, and city [0m[1;36mshops with slices, but nothing more. Might start with plants, once I get the hang of this harvesting stuff."[0m

[33mYou have emoted: Isto nods his head in understanding, [1;36m"Alright. And no, she was, as she had been since her early twenties, a Vampire. But she still brought my children to them. Something I just [0m[1;36mfound out, and found rather ironic. She has borne me a perfect child whereas she lead to the destruction of my wretched mistakes."[0m

[1;36mClearing her throat softly, and whispering, Timber Wolf, Fang Zeva, Rout Guardian says, in a feral tongue, "Doyen, I must rest soon.."[0m

[1;36m"Hrm,"[0;33m Arbre says, allowing the subject to fall, [1;36m"I knew her when she was a childe."[0m

[1;30mYou express your esteem of Zeva for This was one of the most enjoyable times I&#39;ve had with you. And while you didn&#39;t put out a wall of text I really enjoyed your emotes, and you maintained a [0m[1;30mpresence. I would absolutely -love- to see more from you.[0m

[32mArbre tells you, "(( You express your esteem of Zeva for Never seen your roleplay before, and you did well. Try to interact a bit more - I know the conversation was mostly he and I. ))"[0m

[1;30mYou have emoted: [0;33mIsto offers Zeva a small smile before he stands up with a small groan. [1;36m"Here, I&#39;ll grab him. I wanted to ask, before you leave, if you would take up Raddock&#39;s current job. He&#39;s [0m[1;36mnot around often enough and I think if you have a bit more of a voice you would make an excellent candidate for a future Doyen."[0;33m he says gently as he walks over and scoops Ethen into his arms [0m[33mever so gently. [1;36m"Seffa-wulf."[0;33m the young boy coos in his delirious, half-woken state as he is lifted before curling up against his father&#39;s chest and once more passing out.[0m

[33mArbre takes the opportunity to stand as well, brushing the dust from her legs and dress casually as she allows you and Zeva the moment to speak.[0m

09:21:34p | [33mYou have emoted: Isto shrugs his shoulders gently and replies, [1;36m"I was hoping you could do both. It&#39;s merely an opportunity for you to take on a more disciplinary role with the older Rout members [0m[1;36mand perhaps further solidify any further opportunity to ascending to Doyen. If such an opportunity presents itself for you I would like you to be a bit more ready and comfortable in a [0m[1;36mdisciplinary role."[0m'>[33mZeva sits back on her haunches.[0m
[37mYou have emoted: [33mIsto beckons out to one of the padded dummies, calling, [1;36m"Come here, Ethen."[0;33m A little blonde boy with blue eyes waddles out and plops itself down in his lap. [1;36m"I hope you two don't [0m[1;36mmind my son sitting in, do you?"[0;33m he asks Arbre and Zeva.[0m
[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "You have been mortal long enough to spawn?"[0m
[33mZeva shakes her head slightly.[0m
[1;36mRunning his hands over the boy's head gently, you say to Arbre, "A few years, now, actually. Part of the reason I went living. He's about one and a half."[0m
[1;36m"Mm,"[0;33m Arbre intones apathetically, [1;36m"I rather assumed you got the cure for about the same reasons I did. I was surprised in your wife's following the example. But I digress. I imagine you wanted [0m[1;36mto speak of my intentions."[0m
[37mYou have emoted: [33mThe little boy points out at Zeva, murmuring gently [1;36m"Wulf."[0;33m Isto replies softly, [1;36m"Yes, Ethen, a wolf."[0;33m He settles the little boy comfortably in his lap before he nods his head at [0m[33mArbre. [1;36m"I know what it's like to carry the burden of one's past mistakes. I hope that your attaining the Cure and joining us is a sign of your attempt to do so. I hear only rumor, as we've not [0m[1;36mhad many interactions. And I would really like to give you this opportunity, the same I was given."[0;33m he rumbles.[0m
[1;36mYou say, "Perhaps I wasn't clear. In your joining us and attaining the Cure, I hope it is a sign of you trying to rectify any possible misconceptions or mistakes."[0m
[33mArbre nods curtly at you. [1;36m"I like to think I have put things back together well as can be since my rather large blunder five or six decades ago,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"still fine tuning out the details, but [0m[1;36mI have learned loyalty, if that is your insinuation."[0m
[1;36mSpreading his hands in a mollifying before settling them around the boy in his lap, you say to Arbre, "I'm not trying to imply anything. I'm trying to give you an opportunity. You attained our [0m[1;36mclass through the lawless and unloyal action of a previous member, one whom I understand you still interact with."[0m
[32mYou tell Lupine Arbre Aquila, "((gesture. Sorry, I just woke not long ago.))"[0m
[32mYou tell Timber Wolf, Fang Zeva, Rout Guardian, "((gesture. Sorry, I just woke not long ago.))"[0m
[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "I do. I would have joined the Rout proper when I first returned from Duiran, only I landed myself on Osifer's shit-list for him, oh, kidnapping my child."[0m
[33mArbre rolls her shoulders in a shrug. [1;36m"I wanted to be a wolf, badly. That was the only way I could,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"when Doyen changed hands, I began heckling Xentor about allowing me to join the [0m[1;36mguild. Took me some time to put my priorities in order, but here I am."[0m
[1;36mCuriously, you ask, "And do you still spend time with Aren?"[0m
[32mArbre tells you, "(( I assumed as much. The typo part, I mean. I don't stalk you. I promise. ))"[0m
[32mYou tell Lupine Arbre Aquila, "(( >.> ))"[0m
[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "I do. His qualms with the Rout are his own - I do not agree with his bullheaded attitude, but what can I do of it?"[0m
[32mZeva tells you, "((Heh, that is alright.))"[0m
[1;36mYou say, "I'm afraid that I will recommend you cease numerous face-to-face interactions. He will remain an enemy to the guild until such a time as he can demonstrate a change in attitude. This is [0m[1;36mfor -your- benefit, that you might make the most of this opportunity."[0m
[1;30mThe following members of the Atabahi are in the realm:[0m
[33mMember Rank Position Class[0m
[34m----------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
[1;30mIsto the Doyen Guildmaster Lycanthrope[0m
[1;30mZeva a Rout Guardian Secretary Lycanthrope[0m
[1;30mArbre a Lupine Lycanthrope[0m
[33mArbre nods curtly at you. [1;36m"In my own defense, I had no idea he was enemied until my promotion. My opinion is that he paid for his crimes in blood to Xentor's specifications, I do not see why he [0m[1;36mshould remain an enemy. I also think that the GUILD ENEMIES privilege should be lowered to the first rank, if you wish for whelps and such to know who to avoid,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"both are my own [0m[1;36mopinions, to be taken as you will, obviously."[0m
[33mYou have emoted: Isto nods his head in understanding. [1;36m"I haven't gotten that far to look into the privileges, but I will do so. Thank you for pointing it out. As far as his enemy status goes, I [0m[1;36menemied him only just recently based upon his previous actions. Having been slain does not seem to have tempered his attitude, and I am not Xentor. I have given him the opportunity to resolve [0m[1;36mthis peacefully, but until such a time as I believe him to no longer be a threat to our family he will remain an enemy."[0;33m he replies. He reaches up to ruffle his hair a little, nose wrinkling [0m[33min thought before he adds, [1;36m"Note that I did not request you cut ties or complete contact, merely limit your public interactions so that you, and the Rout, are not harmed merely by association."[0m
[33mArbre nods to you. [1;36m"Aren has been irritating the piss out of me lately anyways,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"for much the same reasons you just stated. He and I have a rocky history, at best."[0m
[1;36mGrinning mischievously, you say, "Well, you have an excuse now that will perhaps limit confrontation on your part if you wish it."[0m
[33mZeva lowers her muzzle to the ground slowly, after a moment or two she lays down on her stomach.[0m
[33mYou have emoted: Isto shifts his body as the young boy clambers about his lap, trying to get comfortable before settling against his torso and plopping a thumb in his mouth. His nose wrinkles not [0m[33munlike his father's before his eyes begin to close ever so slowly.[0m
[1;36mYou say to Arbre, "Putting all that aside, I would like to know any reason you might wish to divulge about your change in heart, along with any plans you have for the future."[0m
[33mArbre twists her lips up slightly, real humor beginning to show. [1;36m"I agree with you on his inappropriate behavior towards the Rout, for what it is worth,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"not sure I agree that it is [0m[1;36menemy-status-worth, but that is a less important statement."[0;33m She shifts her weight, sprawling her legs out to one side. She eyes the child distastefully for a moment, but makes no comment of [0m[33mit, drawing her eyes back up to you again.[0m
[1;36mA chuckle breaking into his voice, you say, "We shall see, shan't we?"[0m
[1;36m"I do not intend to violently overthrow the Rout,"[0;33m Arbre offers in an almost irritated tone, [1;36m"I do everything I can for the betterment of myself and the organizations I am in. If I find [0m[1;36mleadership lacking and feel it is both a detriment and that I can do better, I step up. I had no time to make a strong opinion of Xentor, and less of you."[0m
[1;36mOnce more schooling his tone and resting his hands upon his knees, you say, "I'm not implying anything, Arbre. I just know from my own experience that it took quite a kick in my ass to spur a [0m[1;36mchange. I do not know the depths of your mistakes and I'm not overly interested - they are your own. I want to know why you chose to change. And if you work hard, as I've no doubt you will, [0m[1;36myou will be given every opportunity any other trusted Rout member is."[0m
[33mArbre nods curtly, seeming to accept your reply. [1;36m"I will speak freely to you as your position requires it,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"that being said, I should prefer it if this conversation goes no further."[0;33m [0m[33mShe raises a brow at you, flicking her eyes once to Zeva.[0m
[33mZeva drawls lazily, 'I can leave if you like,' her eyes half closed.[0m
[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "I have no problem with you hearing, Ceburi. I have issue with it being repeated."[0m
[1;36mYou say to Arbre, "Zeva's as tight-lipped as they go."[0m
[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "And I assume yourself as well, Doyen?"[0m
[1;36mYou say to Arbre, "Of course."[0m
[1;30mYou have emoted: [0;33mThe young boy starts within Isto's lap, slowing pushing himself out and onto his feet. He reaches back, only to pull forth a plush decapitated head doll, dragging it along the [0m[33mground by its food as he waddles over towards Zeva. [1;36m"Wulf."[0;33m he intones imperiously, holding out a hand towards Zeva's head.[0m
[33mArbre nods curtly to you. [1;36m"I did not want to become undead when I came back from the forests,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"tallied rather long on it, until it became my only option. Desian Arcan was the one [0m[1;36mjudging me worthy or no, and you know how he is. I am the product of one of his assorted sperm donations, so he was worse with me."[0;33m She pauses a moment, coughing and breathing in quickly. She [0m[33mcatches her breath and composes herself, continuing as if there were no interruption. [1;36m"Eventually the blood also became my only option. I was never particularly happy there."[0m
[33mZeva moves her head slowly towards the little boys hand.[0m
[33mYou have emoted: Isto nods his head gently in understanding. [1;36m"I, of all people, know the depths of Desian's... actions. And I certainly know the helpless feeling that leads to taking the Blood."[0;33m [0m[33mhe replies softly before falling silent once more.[0m
[37mYou have emoted: [33mTurning his head to keep Zeva and Ethen in the corner of his eye, Isto watches silently as Ethen reache out and runs a hand very gently over Zeva's snout and down over her head. [0m[33mHe drops the decapitated doll down in front of her before falling forward on his hands, legs refusing to bend too far past his hips. Getting frustrated, he merely rolls himself over onto his [0m[33mbottom before leaning back against Zeva's shoulder, patting her forepaw. [1;36m"Wulf."[0m
[33mArbre's eyes trail over to the child and Zeva, lingering there for a long moment. After a time, she seems to regain her attention, and draws it back over to you. [1;36m"I was hesitant of taking the [0m[1;36mcure, it is true,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"but most of that was in regards to my sire. Once that was solved away, a lingering fear of death and -"[0;33m She cuts herself off at the child's speech. [1;36m"Zeva,"[0;33m she [0m[33msounds out for him slowly, [1;36m"the wolf's name is Zeva."[0m
[33mZeva smiles slowly at the little boy, watching him out of the corner of her half closed eye.[0m
[37mYou have emoted: [33mIsto can't help but smile as Ethen chirps tiredly, [1;36m"Se-ffa."[0;33m He pats Zeva's forepaw once more as if comforting her. Half turning, he buries his face into her fur and begins to [0m[33mdoze once more. [1;36m"I'm proud you chose to bear your fears, Arbre. What was the other, or were the others?"[0;33m he murmurs soothingly.[0m
[1;36m"Bwuh?"[0;33m Arbre says, drawing her attention back to you. She looks at you confused for a moment before your words clear her mind. [1;36m"Fears? I assume you mean with living again,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"that is as [0m[1;36mfar into the subject I am going to go, at least. Silly mortal things make me nervous. Breathing air, not breathing water, stuff you do not have to think of when undead. The sun makes me more [0m[1;36mnervous now than it did when I was blooded, and I have no logical explanation for that one. That is about it."[0;33m She relaxes passively for a moment before widening her eyes, clearly remembering [0m[33msomething. [1;36m"I am used to picking and choosing whom I like as lovers,"[0;33m she says, [1;36m"now I have to remember to be a bit more discerning."[0m
[37mYou have emoted: [33mIsto dips his head towards the now sleeping boy resting against Zeva as he chuckles, [1;36m"Can be a bit of a pickle."[0;33m and winks at Arbre.[0m
[37mYou bestow your guildfavour on Lupine Arbre Aquila.[0m
[1;36m"Thank you for being more intuitive than anyone else I have made that comment to,"[0;33m Arbre says, grumbling, but clearly not directed at you, [1;36m"I adopted two and borne one. Something like three too [0m[1;36mmany daughters for me."[0m
[1;36mSuddenly and quite sheepishly rubbing the back of his neck, you say, "I've adopted uh... three girls, two boys. Of them, only two have been strong enough to be named Cardinalis. I had two boys [0m[1;36mprevious, as well, but I.. uh."[0m
[33mYou have emoted: Isto swallows hard, eyes glued to the sleeping boy before continuing softly, [1;36m"I crushed their skulls in my hands. He... he is different."[0m
[1;36m"Mm, guildfavor for being both beautiful and witty?"[0;33m Arbre says, clearly unaffected by your revelation, [1;36m"not being able to read the logs is irksome. Xavin said something when we first discussed [0m[1;36mme taking the swim about me bearing him a son. I find the idea repulsive."[0m
[33mZeva's eyes fly open and she looks at you before murmuring, 'You what?' Careful to not wake the sleeping boy.[0m
[37mYou have emoted: [33mIsto's face goes immediately blank as he meets Zeva's gaze with an unreadable one of his own. [1;36m"I crushed their skulls in my hands after retrieving them from the Luminaries. Their [0m[1;36mmother sought to hide them from me to punish me, and by that time I could not stand what they stood for, who their mother was or what they were being turned into. So I crushed their skulls and [0m[1;36mstabbed out the eyes of the Luminary guildmistress and her wife. Many, many years ago."[0;33m he replies before nodding to Arbre. [1;36m"The directive tasks lists one Pack as Family. I stated, and I [0m[1;36mquote, It is important to be honest with one another. We have nothing if we do not have trust, and the desire to admit and rectify our mistakes. Thank you, Arbre."[0m
[1;36mLupine Arbre Aquila says, "I am drowning in slices as well. If it were me, I might offer some reward for placement in the current hunt. That might be a self-serving statement however."[0m
[1;36mWith newfound, if grim, humor, you say to Zeva, "Funny. My current wife is the one who brought them to the Luminaries."[0m
[33mYou purse your lips pensively, gazing off into the distance as you carefully gather your thoughts.[0m
[1;36mYou say to Arbre, "Good idea, thank you. I was going to ask, as well - you have experience in running shops?"[0m
[33mArbre furrows her brow. [1;36m"Aithene was never Luminary,"[0;33m she draws out, clearly uncertain, [1;36m"and I would rather claw out my own eyeballs than run a shop. I used to help stock house, order, and city [0m[1;36mshops with slices, but nothing more. Might start with plants, once I get the hang of this harvesting stuff."[0m
[33mYou have emoted: Isto nods his head in understanding, [1;36m"Alright. And no, she was, as she had been since her early twenties, a Vampire. But she still brought my children to them. Something I just [0m[1;36mfound out, and found rather ironic. She has borne me a perfect child whereas she lead to the destruction of my wretched mistakes."[0m
[1;36mClearing her throat softly, and whispering, Timber Wolf, Fang Zeva, Rout Guardian says, in a feral tongue, "Doyen, I must rest soon.."[0m
[1;36m"Hrm,"[0;33m Arbre says, allowing the subject to fall, [1;36m"I knew her when she was a childe."[0m
[1;30mYou express your esteem of Zeva for This was one of the most enjoyable times I've had with you. And while you didn't put out a wall of text I really enjoyed your emotes, and you maintained a [0m[1;30mpresence. I would absolutely -love- to see more from you.[0m
[32mArbre tells you, "(( You express your esteem of Zeva for Never seen your roleplay before, and you did well. Try to interact a bit more - I know the conversation was mostly he and I. ))"[0m
[1;30mYou have emoted: [0;33mIsto offers Zeva a small smile before he stands up with a small groan. [1;36m"Here, I'll grab him. I wanted to ask, before you leave, if you would take up Raddock's current job. He's [0m[1;36mnot around often enough and I think if you have a bit more of a voice you would make an excellent candidate for a future Doyen."[0;33m he says gently as he walks over and scoops Ethen into his arms [0m[33mever so gently. [1;36m"Seffa-wulf."[0;33m the young boy coos in his delirious, half-woken state as he is lifted before curling up against his father's chest and once more passing out.[0m
[33mArbre takes the opportunity to stand as well, brushing the dust from her legs and dress casually as she allows you and Zeva the moment to speak.[0m
