Short hallway. (Spinesreach.?)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. The stone hall extends northward here, though this length is somewhat shorter than the surrounding corridors. A soft light fills the corridor from the floor, the result of some long forgotten runic symbols carved into the ancient stonework. A pinewood door to the east hangs on broken hinges, a small moon carved into the frame. Soaring high above, a mithril clockwork falcon surveys its surroundings with an inanimate gaze.
You see exits leading north, east(open) and south.

You watch in horror, helpless, as Tyriik&#39;s fist is wreathed in crackling black energy. With a diabolical laugh, he stiffens his hand and slowly runs it down your chest, splitting it open as he does so. Though you scream in pain and beg to die, Tyriik proceeds to rip apart your organs, magnifying the pain until you are driven nearly mad. With a detached smile upon his face, he proceeds to rip out your sternum and drive it through your already splayed-out body, pinning it to the ground and finally killing you.
You have been slain by Tyriik.

You watch in horror, helpless, as Tyriik's fist is wreathed in crackling black energy. With a diabolical laugh, he stiffens his hand and slowly runs it down your chest, splitting it open as he does so. Though you scream in pain and beg to die, Tyriik proceeds to rip apart your organs, magnifying the pain until you are driven nearly mad. With a detached smile upon his face, he proceeds to rip out your sternum and drive it through your already splayed-out body, pinning it to the ground and finally killing you.
You have been slain by Tyriik.
