With glossy marble floors and opalescent alabaster walls, the room is dazzling, but it is the beautiful fountain that serves as the focal point of the hall. The base of the fountain is made of three angels, their glorious wings spanning from head to toe. The angels hold a large, glowing red gem over their heads while a thin stream of water flows over it. The water causes the light to refract and flicker, making the jewel look as if it were made of fire. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.

With glossy marble floors and opalescent alabaster walls, the room is dazzling, but it is the beautiful fountain that serves as the focal point of the hall. The base of the fountain is made of three angels, their glorious wings spanning from head to toe. The angels hold a large, glowing red gem over their heads while a thin stream of water flows over it. The water causes the light to refract and flicker, making the jewel look as if it were made of fire. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.

7.1 MOBILES

Mobiles (also referred to as NPCs (non-player-characters), or CCCs
(computer-controlled-characters)) can range from a worm to a dragon to a
human being to a talking sword. Their range of response to you could be
anything from ignoring you, to having something to say back to you, to
attacking you.

Generally, the way you will get a mobile to talk to you is to GREET it.

Some mobiles in Aetolia will become loyal to you in certain
circumstances. If a mobile is loyal to you, you may give it a variety of
commands. These are:

ORDER <mobile> PASSIVE          Pacify an upset mobile.
ORDER <mobile> KILL <player> Order a mobile to attempt to slay someone.
ORDER <mobile> FOLLOW <player>  Order a mobile to follow someone.

ORDER <mobile> GO <direction>   Order a mobile to move somewhere.

While not currently implemented, there are plans to eventually greatly
expand the range of response that a mobile has, as well as give them the
ability to initiate things. For instance, certain mobiles that you have
really upset, might see that you are online and decide to exact revenge.
There you are, relaxing in your house, when there is a light tap on the
door. &#34;Excuse me,&#34; says an unfamiliar voice, &#34;but could I have a word
with you?&#34; Being the gregarious person that you are, you obligingly open
the door at which point the ogre whose mother you insulted last week
rips your arms off and beats you to death with them. Fun!

With glossy marble floors and opalescent alabaster walls, the room is dazzling, but it is the beautiful fountain that serves as the focal point of the hall. The base of the fountain is made of three angels, their glorious wings spanning from head to toe. The angels hold a large, glowing red gem over their heads while a thin stream of water flows over it. The water causes the light to refract and flicker, making the jewel look as if it were made of fire. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.

With glossy marble floors and opalescent alabaster walls, the room is dazzling, but it is the beautiful fountain that serves as the focal point of the hall. The base of the fountain is made of three angels, their glorious wings spanning from head to toe. The angels hold a large, glowing red gem over their heads while a thin stream of water flows over it. The water causes the light to refract and flicker, making the jewel look as if it were made of fire. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.

With glossy marble floors and opalescent alabaster walls, the room is dazzling, but it is the beautiful fountain that serves as the focal point of the hall. The base of the fountain is made of three angels, their glorious wings spanning from head to toe. The angels hold a large, glowing red gem over their heads while a thin stream of water flows over it. The water causes the light to refract and flicker, making the jewel look as if it were made of fire. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully.

7.1 MOBILES
Mobiles (also referred to as NPCs (non-player-characters), or CCCs
(computer-controlled-characters)) can range from a worm to a dragon to a
human being to a talking sword. Their range of response to you could be
anything from ignoring you, to having something to say back to you, to
attacking you.
Generally, the way you will get a mobile to talk to you is to GREET it.
Some mobiles in Aetolia will become loyal to you in certain
circumstances. If a mobile is loyal to you, you may give it a variety of
commands. These are:
ORDER &lt;mobile> PASSIVE Pacify an upset mobile.
ORDER &lt;mobile> KILL &lt;player> Order a mobile to attempt to slay someone.
ORDER &lt;mobile> FOLLOW &lt;player> Order a mobile to follow someone.
ORDER &lt;mobile> CALM If your mobile is panicking, this will calm it.
ORDER &lt;mobile> DROP &lt;whatever> Order a mobile to drop something it is
holding.

more
ORDER &lt;mobile> GO &lt;direction> Order a mobile to move somewhere.
While not currently implemented, there are plans to eventually greatly
expand the range of response that a mobile has, as well as give them the
ability to initiate things. For instance, certain mobiles that you have
really upset, might see that you are online and decide to exact revenge.
There you are, relaxing in your house, when there is a light tap on the
door. "Excuse me," says an unfamiliar voice, "but could I have a word
with you?" Being the gregarious person that you are, you obligingly open
the door at which point the ogre whose mother you insulted last week
rips your arms off and beats you to death with them. Fun!
