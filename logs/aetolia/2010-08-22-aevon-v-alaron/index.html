The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully. There are 2 donkeys here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and west.

The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully. There are 2 donkeys here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.

The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. There are 2 donkeys here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and west.

The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. There are 2 donkeys here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.

--- By the Slyphian Fountain ------ 0:0:0 ---
The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. There are 2 donkeys here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and west.

The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully. There are 2 donkeys here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and west.

The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully. There are 2 donkeys here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and west.

--- By the Slyphian Fountain ------ 0:0:0 ---
The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. There are 2 donkeys here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and west.

The prestigious Slyphian fountain stands tall here, spraying a fine, cool mist over the heated battles of the arena. Decorated in trimmings of gold on a white marble surface, the fountain depicts many religious images pertaining to the realm of Change - an obvious commemoration to the gods that guide many combatants. The area has been flooded with sand. A dark brown root sigil is here. A massive golem made of clay stands here. There are 2 donkeys here. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He is riding on a donkey. He wields a burnished bronze crozier in his left hand and a menacing flail in his right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and west.
