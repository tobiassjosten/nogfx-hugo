To the east, the floor is framed with obsidian glass, but here that fades to slick black stone, though the walls still gleam with glassine darkness as the crystal warps and distorts all light. Set within the panes along each wall, hundreds of duskywing butterflies have been carved, writhing in what might be ecstasy or agony. Each depiction is immensely detailed, devoid of color beyond the refracted glow of the jade torches that are dispersed among them. An elegant obsidian cup has been left on the ground here.
You see exits leading east and southwest.

A few long slits, heavily reinforced and set next to very sturdy shutters, serve as windows, set along the curve of this great stone tower. Due to the elevation of the keep, the view from this place is spectacular, the mighty Vashnars sprawling as towering behemoths capped with snow and ice. The corridor itself is unremarkable, primarily constructed for defense in the event the tower is attacked from air. A Nazetu crossbowman stands here on alert.
You see exits leading northeast and south.

To the east, the floor is framed with obsidian glass, but here that fades to slick black stone, though the walls still gleam with glassine darkness as the crystal warps and distorts all light. Set within the panes along each wall, hundreds of duskywing butterflies have been carved, writhing in what might be ecstasy or agony. Each depiction is immensely detailed, devoid of color beyond the refracted glow of the jade torches that are dispersed among them. An elegant obsidian cup has been left on the ground here.
You see exits leading east and southwest.

A few long slits, heavily reinforced and set next to very sturdy shutters, serve as windows, set along the curve of this great stone tower. Due to the elevation of the keep, the view from this place is spectacular, the mighty Vashnars sprawling as towering behemoths capped with snow and ice. The corridor itself is unremarkable, primarily constructed for defense in the event the tower is attacked from air. A Nazetu crossbowman stands here on alert.
You see exits leading northeast and south.
