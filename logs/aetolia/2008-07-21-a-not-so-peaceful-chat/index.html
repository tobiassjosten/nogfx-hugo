Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an begins drifting forward, her tail supporting her 
as she descends from her perch above the banister. As she is about to touch feet
to floor, a loud crack is heard and Litania now has a piece of the banister 
wrapped in her tail.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "Just like that."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "You have told me essentially nothing."

You have emoted: Elene glances over to survey the damage done, before allowing 
her eyes to settle upon Litania. She cocks her head to the right.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an looks to her tail and the piece of banister it 
holds. With a flick of the tip, she pops the broken piece of banister into the 
air while simultaneously sucking in a deep breath.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an exhales sharply and an intense blue flame shoots 
from her mouth, hitting the airborne banister piece. It floats to the white 
forest floor as ashes.

Litania smirks.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks you, "You think I&#39;m just a tool to be used as
you please?"
 
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an is facing you now, the heat of her flame still 
radiating from her lips.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks, "Well?"

You have emoted: Elene leans down, retrieving the ashes of the piece of banister
in her hands. Putting away her quill for safekeeping, she scatters the blackened
remains of the banister where it should be. A short invocation, and from the 
floating ashes within the air, the gaping hole of the damage forms in violent 
lashes of jade and black. "Really, you should respect one&#39;s house."

You have emoted: Elene smoothens the intersection of the reformed area with a 
hand, before flickering around, the edge of her robes circling around her feet. 
"Do you think that? Yourself as a tool? Interesting."

Litania scoffs loudly, arrogantly dismissive.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "Absolutely not."

Litania pales slightly.

Litania gasps, and glows momentarily.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "The only way in which I consider myself a 
tool is as an educator."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an looks at you, a bit of disgust creeping onto her 
face.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks you, "How can you possibly consider yourself 
a Cabalist?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an has lost the golden glow and panapoly of color 
from her eyes. As she looks upon you, they begin losing their color entirely, 
fading to white. It would appear as if Litania has no irises.

You have emoted: Elene throws her head back in a display of her arrogance. "What
gives you the right to judge one as to their worthiness in being a Cabalist?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an giggles, but it is no female voice. The voice 
isn&#39;t male either, as you hear her giggle further.

You have emoted: Elene splays out a single hand in front of her, a crackling of 
dark essence surrounding the appendage. "A Cabalist is everything but himself."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks, "I repeat, then. How can you consider 
yourself a Cabalist?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an has gone without blinking for many minutes now. As
you think about that fact, you realize she isn&#39;t looking -at- you, but -through-
you.

You have emoted: Elene jerks her thumb in Litania&#39;s direction. "I educate. I 
strive for power. I crave for Knowledge and withhold it when it pleases me to do
so." An eerie smirk pasted across her lips, she makes her way to her, yet she 
seems to be observing her crackling hand. "Of course, the five Tenets I hold 
dear, has been my company these forty years. And so I consider myself a 
Cabalist."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an continues to seem like she is looking through you 
to something on the other side. A bemused expression lingers on her lips and 
when she speaks, it is not with just one voice.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "A True Cabalist would never have done to us
what you did, Dhasan."

You have emoted: Elene folds her arms and regards Litania steadily. "A True 
Cabalist is one that I&#39;ll hardly think you embody either."

You have emoted: Elene&#39;s voice is low, its sibilant tone oddly ringing in the 
balcony. "A True Cabalist, stops at nothing for their Knowledge. This is where 
it plays host to Lgakt."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an grins a most peculiar grin. The left side of her 
face seems to smile while the other side seems to scowl.

You have emoted: Elene runs the crackling hand down the other arm of hers, 
splitting open skin and spilling blood. "Nor would the Lord Jy&#39;barrak Golgotha 
have claimed me as his own, should it be otherwise."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an simply looks upon you for a short time. Her 
expression remains unchanged. An unearthly growl comes from somewhere deep 
inside Litania as her eyes turn from white to red in but an instant.

You have emoted: Elene flicks droplets of blood upon Litania&#39;s features, her 
frame shuddering with the effort of corporeality. "And you, Litania. Has 
something I daresay should be rid within you."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an Opens her mouth just enough for the growl to 
escape her lips.

"&#39;A True Cabalist,&#39;" a black-haired man recites as he walks into view, "&#39;stops 
at nothing for their Knowledge.&#39; Such lovely words, so well-spoken and thought 
out, wouldn&#39;t you agree, Dhasan?" he says amiably, a warm smile on his face as 
he ignores the obvious carnage and tension surrounding him.
 
The man says, "Why, the last time I heard such words, the Vampire race was but a
glimmer in the Ankryeans collective eye."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an looks from the man to Elene. Litania opens her 
mouth as if to speak but closes it again. Her eyes glow several colors, one 
after another.

You have emoted: Elene turns her attention towards the man within the room, 
whose presence has escaped her notice. "&#39;Those were the days&#39;?" she repeats, and
gives a wry smile. "Plenty of Knowledge of the situation then, have you not?"

The man says, "Litania, my dear, do you know what your problem is?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an turns to face the two of you. The colors of her 
eyes shifting too rapidly to discern what it is at any point in time.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to the man, "I don&#39;t even know -who- you are,
but I&#39;ll take a wild guess that your problem is Elene."

Litania smirks.

Litania performs a graceful curtsey towards you.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to you, "Beg your pardon, -Dhasan- Elene."

"Other than the fact that you are unable to listen to the fact that I asked 
about -your- problem, Cabalist, I would venture a guess to say that you serve 
too many masters," he says. "And by the look and sound of you, none of them 
would be the Knowledge that you so fervently speak of."

You have emoted: Elene leans against the nearest stone wall within the balcony 
area, calmly observing the man, seemingly ignoring Litania&#39;s presence for the 
moment.

The man says, "You serve the Corruptor. You serve Bahir&#39;an. You serve the Cabal.
But most of all, you serve yourself."

The man shrugs softly. "No one benefits from that, my dear. Not even you," he 
says.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an squares back her shoulders, closes her eyes quite 
hard and seems to whisper something to herself.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks the man, "Who are you?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks the man, "How do you know who I am?"

The man says, "Dhasan Elene knows. She&#39;s already got it figured out."

The man says, "Haven&#39;t you?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an opens her eyes with a start and a gasp of air, her
eyes a shimmering emerald.

You have emoted: Elene crooks her head by a scant inch. "&#39;The Corruptor&#39;," she 
says thoughtfully, "I find you familiar indeed, Lord Artifice."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an looks from Elene back to the man.

Litania&#39;s breath catches in a gasp of surprise.

The man inclines his head politely to those around him.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an appears to have a hard time breathing.

Litania performs a graceful curtsey towards the man.

The man says, "Yes, those were the days. The days when the arrogance and the 
ambition of foolish mortals led to their own eventual downfall."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to the man, "I.. I... You... Artifice?!"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an takes a deep breath to steady herself.

The man says, "I am."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to the man, "I&#39;m a bit speechless, please 
forgive me."

The man says, "I am glad for it."

The man says, "Be mindful, child, that your attitude and outlook on such tenets 
as Knowledge and Power do not lead you down the same path of the ruined 

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an seems to go weak for a moment as she drops to her 
knees. Her gaze never leaves that of the man.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "The Ankyreans were arrogant..."

You have emoted: Elene pushes herself off from the wall, her eyes sharp and 
renewed with curiosity. "Mortal failings. Of arrogance, I would believe so," she

The man says, "Arrogant, Litania?"

The man says, "You speak of arrogance?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an continues sinking to the ground until she is on 
her hands and knees looking up at the man.

The man says, "The Ankyreans stopped at nothing to achieve the Knowledge that 
they sought, did they not?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an exclaims, "To the ultimate destruction of nerely 
their entire civilization!"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "Knowledge is useless without existance."

The man says, "No."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to the man, "Forgive my outburst, Artifice."

The man says, "Knowledge is useless without wisdom."
 
The man says, "In the face for Power, there are two types of people."

Litania tilts her head and listens intently to the man.

The man says, "There is the person who sees the endpoint in the distance, and 
runs as fast and as hard as they can towards it, no matter what the cost."

You have emoted: Elene remains silent, the edges of her cloak fluttering as the 
breeze of the wind sweeps past the balcony.
Balance Used: 1.25 seconds

The man says, "There is also the second person. The second person watches as the
first falls into a carefully-laid trap, and uses that observation to guide their
own way around it."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an leans back on her haunches. She is obviously 
overcoming what could only be described as shock.

The man says, "Do you both understand?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to the man, "I do."

The man tells you, "Though I know you do, My dear."

The man says, "I should hope so."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an nods her head slowly and stands back on her feet 
with some effort.

The man says, "Do not be so eager for power, that you will ignore any and all 
costs to achieve it."

You have emoted: Elene&#39;s black orbs glance over at Litania&#39;s frame, before 
returning to the man. "Wise words, Lord Artifice. Thank you."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks the man, "You are very wise indeed, but... 
Why, Lord Artifice? Why have you shown yourself to me?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "I&#39;ve never been so shocked in my entire 
existance."

The man says, "Because your words and your little lightshow here amused Me."

You have emoted: Elene allows herself a wry smile.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an grins at the man.

The man says, "It is not an amusement that I would dare you to ever attempt 
again, but nonetheless...the Creator of Illusions knows one when He sees one."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to the man, "You mean my eyes, Lord Artifice.
Aye, an illusion."

The man says, "I mean more about you than you know, child."

Light in the room vanishes as shadows overtake every visible inch. When the 
shadows recede, the man has vanished.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "I&#39;m sure yo..."

The Divine voice of Someone powerful echoes in your head, "This will not be the 
last time that you and I speak, My dear."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an looks around the room, searching for some sign of 
the man.

You have emoted: Elene settles herself comfortably in her position, her eyes 
surveying the area, before noting the disappearance of the man. Aloud, she says,
"It&#39;ll be a pleasure to be able to, Lord Artifice."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an turns to face you, her face twisted into some 
combination of ultimate glee and horrible fear.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to you, "I..."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an pauses.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an puts a hand to her forehead.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an exclaims to you, "What just happened?!"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an laughs hysterically for a moment before calming 
back down, her breathing rapid and shallow.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "The... The Lord of Artifice..."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "He... He was here, spoke to me..."

You have emoted: Elene spreads her arms in front of her, preferring to remain 
silent, and amused.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an looks up at you, tears in her eyes, the emotion 
behind them unintelligable. She swiftly walks to immediately in front of you, 
stopping short by a few inches from making contact.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to you, "Please, help me to understand what 
just happened, Elene. Dhasan Elene... I beg you, don&#39;t just leave me to suffer 
like this."

You have emoted: Elene raises a single, slender eyebrow, pulling her hands to 
her side. "First you criticise. Now you beg for my help."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an drops to her knees in front of you and clutches 
the front of your clothing.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "I don&#39;t even know what to think anymore."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an exclaims, "It&#39;s as if everything I thought I knew 
about you and how you felt about me, and the Guild and.. I just... I don&#39;t 
know!"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an Was all this planned from the start??

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks, "Was all this planned from the start?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks, "Are you his Cardinal?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks, "What is going to happen to me?"
<
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks, "Was this all a test?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an slumps back on her haunches, allowing your clothes
from her grasp.

You have emoted: Elene closes her eyes for a moment, her face tilted upwards as 
her lips move in a soft murmur. Opening them again, she answers, "Lord Severn&#39;s 
words contain wisdom. Coming from a Divine who has witnessed the destruction and
mistakes of the Epoch, you should listen to Him."

You wryly say, "As for your other questions, I&#39;m inclined to stay silent."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an sits in front of you, nodding slowly.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says to you, "I understand, Dhasan. Do keep 
silent... Knowledge is power, after all."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an sounds utterly defeated and looks as if she were a
small child again. Her normally proud shoulders hunch over and the gleam in her 
eye is replaced by a cold emptiness.

You have emoted: Elene extends a hand out towards Litania. "I&#39;m glad you 
understand that. Now then, I really do have work to do. Do you have a particular
place you wish to be? To think, I presume."

You have emoted: Elene&#39;s inscrutable black orbs fall upon Litania&#39;s prone 
figure.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an looks up at you and takes your hand, allowing you 
to help her up.

Litania pales slightly.

Litania gasps, and glows momentarily.

You say, "Any particular preference, then?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "I, I can return to the library... Please, I
wish..."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an seems as though she wishes to ask something, but 
is afraid to.

You say, "Ask."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks, "Why did Lord Artifice appear to me? There 
are so many people in the realm... Why me?"

Litania mumbles incoherently.

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an mutters, "Such an h..or and I m... . fool o.. of 
myself."

You say, "As was mentioned, His attention was caught by your words and your 
lightshow."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an asks, "I guess the better question is, was it just
a matter of amusement? Am I simply entertaining to Him? Or is there something 
else?"

You say, "The Lord of Artifice hardly takes amusement in such matters. That 
would be the Trickster. These questions, you must ask yourself."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an searches your face as you speak. She is obviously 
shaken up by this encounter, your vague answer eliciting a concerned expression.

You say, "Answers come from within."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "I&#39;ve always believed as much, but after 
that..."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an looks back to where she last say Lord Artifice 
standing.


You say, "Then take your answers from observations."

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "It all happened so quickly..."

You say, "Is quick not good?"

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an says, "Aye, it certainly leaves one for wanting."

You smile wryly.

With a slight bending of the waist, you offer a bow.

You say, "A pleasure, Litania."

Litania tells you, "Dhasan, my apologies for not curtseying, as is proper... I&#39;m
so, flabergasted."

You tell Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an, "Confusion means learning, or 
re-learning. I suppose."

Litania tells you, "Will you be willing to discuss this with me anymore, Dhasan 
or am I on my own...?"

You tell Litania, Cabalist of Bahir&#39;an, "You are on your own. Should you 
encounter anything else troubling, you may discuss with me, indeed."'>You have emoted: Elene allows a wry smile to flitter across her lips. "Probably
not for some time. I need to be off to complete a few paper work. The
conversation has been refreshing, Litania."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an begins drifting forward, her tail supporting her
as she descends from her perch above the banister. As she is about to touch feet
to floor, a loud crack is heard and Litania now has a piece of the banister
wrapped in her tail.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "Just like that."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "You have told me essentially nothing."
You have emoted: Elene glances over to survey the damage done, before allowing
her eyes to settle upon Litania. She cocks her head to the right.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an looks to her tail and the piece of banister it
holds. With a flick of the tip, she pops the broken piece of banister into the

from her mouth, hitting the airborne banister piece. It floats to the white
forest floor as ashes.
Litania smirks.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks you, "You think I'm just a tool to be used as
you please?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an is facing you now, the heat of her flame still
radiating from her lips.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks, "Well?"
You have emoted: Elene leans down, retrieving the ashes of the piece of banister
in her hands. Putting away her quill for safekeeping, she scatters the blackened
remains of the banister where it should be. A short invocation, and from the
floating ashes within the air, the gaping hole of the damage forms in violent
lashes of jade and black. "Really, you should respect one's house."
You have emoted: Elene smoothens the intersection of the reformed area with a
hand, before flickering around, the edge of her robes circling around her feet.
"Do you think that? Yourself as a tool? Interesting."
Litania scoffs loudly, arrogantly dismissive.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "Absolutely not."
Litania pales slightly.
Litania gasps, and glows momentarily.

face.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks you, "How can you possibly consider yourself

Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an has lost the golden glow and panapoly of color
from her eyes. As she looks upon you, they begin losing their color entirely,
fading to white. It would appear as if Litania has no irises.

You have emoted: Elene jerks her thumb in Litania's direction. "I educate. I
strive for power. I crave for Knowledge and withhold it when it pleases me to do
so." An eerie smirk pasted across her lips, she makes her way to her, yet she
seems to be observing her crackling hand. "Of course, the five Tenets I hold
dear, has been my company these forty years. And so I consider myself a
Cabalist."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an continues to seem like she is looking through you
to something on the other side. A bemused expression lingers on her lips and
when she speaks, it is not with just one voice.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "A True Cabalist would never have done to us
what you did, Dhasan."
You have emoted: Elene folds her arms and regards Litania steadily. "A True
Cabalist is one that I'll hardly think you embody either."
You have emoted: Elene's voice is low, its sibilant tone oddly ringing in the
balcony. "A True Cabalist, stops at nothing for their Knowledge. This is where
it plays host to Lgakt."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an grins a most peculiar grin. The left side of her
face seems to smile while the other side seems to scowl.
You have emoted: Elene runs the crackling hand down the other arm of hers,
splitting open skin and spilling blood. "Nor would the Lord Jy'barrak Golgotha
have claimed me as his own, should it be otherwise."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an simply looks upon you for a short time. Her
expression remains unchanged. An unearthly growl comes from somewhere deep
inside Litania as her eyes turn from white to red in but an instant.
You have emoted: Elene flicks droplets of blood upon Litania's features, her
frame shuddering with the effort of corporeality. "And you, Litania. Has
something I daresay should be rid within you."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an Opens her mouth just enough for the growl to
escape her lips.
"'A True Cabalist,'" a black-haired man recites as he walks into view, "'stops
at nothing for their Knowledge.' Such lovely words, so well-spoken and thought
out, wouldn't you agree, Dhasan?" he says amiably, a warm smile on his face as
he ignores the obvious carnage and tension surrounding him.
The man says, "Why, the last time I heard such words, the Vampire race was but a
glimmer in the Ankryeans collective eye."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an looks from the man to Elene. Litania opens her
mouth as if to speak but closes it again. Her eyes glow several colors, one
after another.
You have emoted: Elene turns her attention towards the man within the room,
whose presence has escaped her notice. "'Those were the days'?" she repeats, and
gives a wry smile. "Plenty of Knowledge of the situation then, have you not?"
The man says, "Litania, my dear, do you know what your problem is?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an turns to face the two of you. The colors of her
eyes shifting too rapidly to discern what it is at any point in time.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to the man, "I don't even know -who- you are,
but I'll take a wild guess that your problem is Elene."
Litania smirks.
Litania performs a graceful curtsey towards you.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to you, "Beg your pardon, -Dhasan- Elene."
"Other than the fact that you are unable to listen to the fact that I asked
about -your- problem, Cabalist, I would venture a guess to say that you serve
too many masters," he says. "And by the look and sound of you, none of them
would be the Knowledge that you so fervently speak of."
You have emoted: Elene leans against the nearest stone wall within the balcony
area, calmly observing the man, seemingly ignoring Litania's presence for the
moment.
The man says, "You serve the Corruptor. You serve Bahir'an. You serve the Cabal.
But most of all, you serve yourself."
The man shrugs softly. "No one benefits from that, my dear. Not even you," he
says.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an squares back her shoulders, closes her eyes quite
hard and seems to whisper something to herself.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks the man, "Who are you?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks the man, "How do you know who I am?"
The man says, "Dhasan Elene knows. She's already got it figured out."
The man says, "Haven't you?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an opens her eyes with a start and a gasp of air, her
eyes a shimmering emerald.
You have emoted: Elene crooks her head by a scant inch. "'The Corruptor'," she
says thoughtfully, "I find you familiar indeed, Lord Artifice."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an looks from Elene back to the man.
Litania's breath catches in a gasp of surprise.
The man inclines his head politely to those around him.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an appears to have a hard time breathing.
Litania performs a graceful curtsey towards the man.
The man says, "Yes, those were the days. The days when the arrogance and the
ambition of foolish mortals led to their own eventual downfall."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to the man, "I.. I... You... Artifice?!"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an takes a deep breath to steady herself.
The man says, "I am."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to the man, "I'm a bit speechless, please
forgive me."
The man says, "I am glad for it."
The man says, "Be mindful, child, that your attitude and outlook on such tenets
as Knowledge and Power do not lead you down the same path of the ruined
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an seems to go weak for a moment as she drops to her
knees. Her gaze never leaves that of the man.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "The Ankyreans were arrogant..."
You have emoted: Elene pushes herself off from the wall, her eyes sharp and
renewed with curiosity. "Mortal failings. Of arrogance, I would believe so," she
The man says, "Arrogant, Litania?"
The man says, "You speak of arrogance?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an continues sinking to the ground until she is on
her hands and knees looking up at the man.
The man says, "The Ankyreans stopped at nothing to achieve the Knowledge that
they sought, did they not?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an exclaims, "To the ultimate destruction of nerely
their entire civilization!"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "Knowledge is useless without existance."
The man says, "No."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to the man, "Forgive my outburst, Artifice."
The man says, "Knowledge is useless without wisdom."
The man says, "In the face for Power, there are two types of people."
Litania tilts her head and listens intently to the man.
The man says, "There is the person who sees the endpoint in the distance, and
runs as fast and as hard as they can towards it, no matter what the cost."
You have emoted: Elene remains silent, the edges of her cloak fluttering as the
breeze of the wind sweeps past the balcony.
Balance Used: 1.25 seconds
The man says, "There is also the second person. The second person watches as the
first falls into a carefully-laid trap, and uses that observation to guide their
own way around it."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an leans back on her haunches. She is obviously
overcoming what could only be described as shock.
The man says, "Do you both understand?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to the man, "I do."
The man tells you, "Though I know you do, My dear."
The man says, "I should hope so."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an nods her head slowly and stands back on her feet
with some effort.
The man says, "Do not be so eager for power, that you will ignore any and all
costs to achieve it."
You have emoted: Elene's black orbs glance over at Litania's frame, before
returning to the man. "Wise words, Lord Artifice. Thank you."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks the man, "You are very wise indeed, but...
Why, Lord Artifice? Why have you shown yourself to me?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "I've never been so shocked in my entire
existance."
The man says, "Because your words and your little lightshow here amused Me."
You have emoted: Elene allows herself a wry smile.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an grins at the man.
The man says, "It is not an amusement that I would dare you to ever attempt
again, but nonetheless...the Creator of Illusions knows one when He sees one."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to the man, "You mean my eyes, Lord Artifice.
Aye, an illusion."
The man says, "I mean more about you than you know, child."
Light in the room vanishes as shadows overtake every visible inch. When the
shadows recede, the man has vanished.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "I'm sure yo..."
The Divine voice of Someone powerful echoes in your head, "This will not be the
last time that you and I speak, My dear."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an looks around the room, searching for some sign of
the man.
You have emoted: Elene settles herself comfortably in her position, her eyes
surveying the area, before noting the disappearance of the man. Aloud, she says,
"It'll be a pleasure to be able to, Lord Artifice."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an turns to face you, her face twisted into some
combination of ultimate glee and horrible fear.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to you, "I..."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an pauses.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an puts a hand to her forehead.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an exclaims to you, "What just happened?!"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an laughs hysterically for a moment before calming
back down, her breathing rapid and shallow.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "The... The Lord of Artifice..."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "He... He was here, spoke to me..."
You have emoted: Elene spreads her arms in front of her, preferring to remain
silent, and amused.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an looks up at you, tears in her eyes, the emotion
behind them unintelligable. She swiftly walks to immediately in front of you,
stopping short by a few inches from making contact.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to you, "Please, help me to understand what
just happened, Elene. Dhasan Elene... I beg you, don't just leave me to suffer
like this."
You have emoted: Elene raises a single, slender eyebrow, pulling her hands to
her side. "First you criticise. Now you beg for my help."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an drops to her knees in front of you and clutches
the front of your clothing.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "I don't even know what to think anymore."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an exclaims, "It's as if everything I thought I knew
about you and how you felt about me, and the Guild and.. I just... I don't
know!"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an Was all this planned from the start??
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks, "Was all this planned from the start?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks, "Are you his Cardinal?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks, "What is going to happen to me?"
&lt;
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks, "Was this all a test?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an slumps back on her haunches, allowing your clothes
from her grasp.
You have emoted: Elene closes her eyes for a moment, her face tilted upwards as
her lips move in a soft murmur. Opening them again, she answers, "Lord Severn's
words contain wisdom. Coming from a Divine who has witnessed the destruction and
mistakes of the Epoch, you should listen to Him."
You wryly say, "As for your other questions, I'm inclined to stay silent."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an sits in front of you, nodding slowly.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says to you, "I understand, Dhasan. Do keep
silent... Knowledge is power, after all."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an sounds utterly defeated and looks as if she were a
small child again. Her normally proud shoulders hunch over and the gleam in her
eye is replaced by a cold emptiness.
You have emoted: Elene extends a hand out towards Litania. "I'm glad you
understand that. Now then, I really do have work to do. Do you have a particular
place you wish to be? To think, I presume."
You have emoted: Elene's inscrutable black orbs fall upon Litania's prone
figure.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an looks up at you and takes your hand, allowing you
to help her up.
Litania pales slightly.
Litania gasps, and glows momentarily.
You say, "Any particular preference, then?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "I, I can return to the library... Please, I
wish..."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an seems as though she wishes to ask something, but
is afraid to.
You say, "Ask."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks, "Why did Lord Artifice appear to me? There
are so many people in the realm... Why me?"
Litania mumbles incoherently.
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an mutters, "Such an h..or and I m... . fool o.. of
myself."
You say, "As was mentioned, His attention was caught by your words and your
lightshow."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an asks, "I guess the better question is, was it just
a matter of amusement? Am I simply entertaining to Him? Or is there something
else?"
You say, "The Lord of Artifice hardly takes amusement in such matters. That
would be the Trickster. These questions, you must ask yourself."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an searches your face as you speak. She is obviously
shaken up by this encounter, your vague answer eliciting a concerned expression.
You say, "Answers come from within."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "I've always believed as much, but after
that..."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an looks back to where she last say Lord Artifice
standing.
You say, "Then take your answers from observations."
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "It all happened so quickly..."
You say, "Is quick not good?"
Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an says, "Aye, it certainly leaves one for wanting."
You smile wryly.
With a slight bending of the waist, you offer a bow.
You say, "A pleasure, Litania."
Litania tells you, "Dhasan, my apologies for not curtseying, as is proper... I'm
so, flabergasted."
You tell Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an, "Confusion means learning, or
re-learning. I suppose."
Litania tells you, "Will you be willing to discuss this with me anymore, Dhasan
or am I on my own...?"
You tell Litania, Cabalist of Bahir'an, "You are on your own. Should you
encounter anything else troubling, you may discuss with me, indeed."</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+1 points with 1 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
