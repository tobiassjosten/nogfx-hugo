--- Bloody den - -8:-12:0 ---
A small clearing makes room to a blood spattered cave. Claw marks and gnawed and splintered bones 
show this are to be the den of a large, carnivorous animal. Snakes coil lazily around tree branches, 
unafraid but no smaller animal or bird dares come too close. The predator seems to be absent at the 
moment but a well trod path into the undergrowth shows that it has not been absent for very long. 
Its armored plating covered in an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Ears 
perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling from its form, a 
miniature ice elemental rests here. Arch Duke Nokk &#34;The Prodigy&#34; Nebre'seir is here, hidden. He 
wields a buckler in his left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and northwest.

--- Bloody den - -8:-12:0 ---
A small clearing makes room to a blood spattered cave. Claw marks and gnawed and splintered bones 
show this are to be the den of a large, carnivorous animal. Snakes coil lazily around tree branches, 
unafraid but no smaller animal or bird dares come too close. The predator seems to be absent at the 
moment but a well trod path into the undergrowth shows that it has not been absent for very long. 
Its armored plating covered in an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Ears 
perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling from its form, a 
miniature ice elemental rests here. Arch Duke Nokk &#34;The Prodigy&#34; Nebre'seir is here, sprawled on the 
floor. He wields a buckler in his left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and northwest.

The thick canopy prevents sunlight from reaching the jungle floor regardless of hour. Strange plants 
grow here, in defiance of the lack of light. Fleshy vines with long, dark spines lash themselves to 
rough barked trees and tiny bones liter their bases. The movements of animals in the underbrush 
sound from all directions and the hum of insects, caw of birds and hiss of serpents highlight the 
vibrancy of life within this dark wood. A fresh water stream pours in to pool here, creating a 
watering hole in the darkness through which small, glowing fish dart. Its armored plating covered in 
an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a 
sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here. 
Arch Duke Nokk &#34;The Prodigy&#34; Nebre'seir is here, sprawled on the floor. He wields a buckler in his 
left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

The thick canopy prevents sunlight from reaching the jungle floor regardless of hour. Strange plants 
grow here, in defiance of the lack of light. Fleshy vines with long, dark spines lash themselves to 
rough barked trees and tiny bones liter their bases. The movements of animals in the underbrush 
sound from all directions and the hum of insects, caw of birds and hiss of serpents highlight the 
vibrancy of life within this dark wood. A fresh water stream pours in to pool here, creating a 
watering hole in the darkness through which small, glowing fish dart. Its armored plating covered in 
an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a 
sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here. 
Arch Duke Nokk &#34;The Prodigy&#34; Nebre'seir is here, hidden. He wields a buckler in his left hand and an 
ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

show this are to be the den of a large, carnivorous animal. Snakes coil lazily around tree branches,
unafraid but no smaller animal or bird dares come too close. The predator seems to be absent at the

Its armored plating covered in an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Ears
perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling from its form, a
miniature ice elemental rests here. Arch Duke Nokk "The Prodigy" Nebre'seir is here, hidden. He
wields a buckler in his left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and northwest.

You see exits leading north, northeast, and northwest.

Magical darkness enshrouds this area. Vines of every hue and texture dangle down from the trees here,
swaying and writhing with the breeze. Strangle flickering betrays the presence of snakes hanging
down amongst the vines awaiting prey. Despite the snakes, this spot offers a look down over the rest
of the jungle. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling
from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here.
You see exits leading southeast, south, and southwest.

Duke Nokk "The Prodigy" Nebre'seir is here, hidden. He wields a buckler in his left hand and an
ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

Nokk's eyes meet yours, suddenly locking your gaze to his. He utters a sharp, unintelligible whisper,
and you break free of his piercing gaze.
You suddenly feel as if your body is inflating, becoming stretched thin like a balloon. Immediately
a great fear of anything piercing you too deeply possesses you.

The thick canopy prevents sunlight from reaching the jungle floor regardless of hour. Strange plants
grow here, in defiance of the lack of light. Fleshy vines with long, dark spines lash themselves to
rough barked trees and tiny bones liter their bases. The movements of animals in the underbrush
sound from all directions and the hum of insects, caw of birds and hiss of serpents highlight the
vibrancy of life within this dark wood. A fresh water stream pours in to pool here, creating a
watering hole in the darkness through which small, glowing fish dart. Its armored plating covered in
an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a
sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here.
Arch Duke Nokk "The Prodigy" Nebre'seir is here, sprawled on the floor. He wields a buckler in his
left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

The thick canopy prevents sunlight from reaching the jungle floor regardless of hour. Strange plants
grow here, in defiance of the lack of light. Fleshy vines with long, dark spines lash themselves to
rough barked trees and tiny bones liter their bases. The movements of animals in the underbrush
sound from all directions and the hum of insects, caw of birds and hiss of serpents highlight the
vibrancy of life within this dark wood. A fresh water stream pours in to pool here, creating a
watering hole in the darkness through which small, glowing fish dart. Its armored plating covered in
an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a
sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here.
Arch Duke Nokk "The Prodigy" Nebre'seir is here, hidden. He wields a buckler in his left hand and an
ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.
