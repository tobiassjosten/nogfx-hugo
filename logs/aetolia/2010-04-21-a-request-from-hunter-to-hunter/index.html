She is a resilient Mhun of moderate height and musculature befitting of a survivalist. A brusque woman of the wilds, her chestnut skin is roughened by the elements, marred in several places by scrapes and light bruises. Unembellished and indelicate, she moves with a lithe agility that is more athletic than feminine. Her auburn hair is a tangle of braids, baubles, and feathers, an untamed mane of wild nature and utter disregard for vanity. Her manner is alert and unflinching, a caged ferocity evident in her feral presence. She is wearing:
a rough, tribal satchel of patchwork leather
a bronze medallion of the sentinels
a woven leather basque top
a weathered leather belt-pouch
an umbral medallion
a woodburned fire ring
a woodburned ice ring
an ornate ring of ash wood
a smooth buckskin Sentinel\&#39;s weaponbelt
tribal hunting robes of bone and fur
a suit of steel chain mail
a rustic braided leather necklace
an amulet of cleansing
a carved ring of ivy wood
a circlet of aesthesis
an intricate alderwood ring of vigour
a pair of laced-up doeskin boots
a pleated skirt of banded leather
a simple ring of heatherwood
an icy ring of white birch
She walks with the blessing of Haern.

Ambirle arrives from the southwest.
 
Ambirle slips into the alcove almost silently, propping her mottled shoulder against the entrance with a practiced, casual ease.

You incline your head politely to Ambirle.
 
Ambirle twists her finger into her hair, opens her mouth to speak, and then shuts it. Quietly, she begins instead, \"Pity. I come here to speak to you, and I come without a name.\"

You say to Ambirle, \"Don\&#39;t think we\&#39;ve ever met. I\&#39;m the co-proprietor here, or my name would be on the shop too. It\&#39;s Sibatti.\"
 
\"Of the annex?\" Ambirle asks, gesturing vaguely to the surroundings, her thick eyebrows lifting.

You have emoted: \"Annex?\" Sibatti repeats, eyebrows raised. \"Not sure what you refer to.\"

 ql  <<Soooo... I thought I was in my shop, srsly.>>
Cooking annex. (Enorian.)
An argent intercessor is poised here, hefting an ancient-looking halberd in her glowing hands. Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl is here. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading south and southwest.
 
Ambirle heaves a sigh, shakes her head, and lets the matter drop. \"I\&#39;m Ambirle Dire,\" she explains, touching the pendant she wears around her throat. \"Do you know why I\&#39;m here?\"

You have emoted: Sibatti cradles her forehead in her hand and sighs. \"I blame Raum for this. Sorry, I thought I was in my shop, and he\&#39;d delivered me earlier without warning. Spare me a good laugh, I\&#39;m still disoriented from it, I guess.\"

You have emoted: \"And no,\" Sibatti answers quietly, scratching at her throat. \"I don\&#39;t believe I do.\"
 
Silence lingers for a moment before Ambirle laughs easily, tossing her head back. \"Ah, well. It happens to some, I suppose,\" she replies, offering no excuse. Pushing off the entrance she leans against, she takes a single step towards you, deftly changing the subject. \"Can\&#39;t say I\&#39;ve seen another of my kind in a while.\"

You push the mask up over your head, removing it.

Ambirle:
She is a muscular Mhun of wiry grace. Her small frame is lean and soft, near feline. Lithe limbs lend her an agile lankiness despite her short height. Hands both wide and coarse have dirty, ragged fingernails. Her palms are lined with faded, unnatural marks. Another marking wraps her upper arm, a long, sinuous rune creasing her skin. Tanned a golden brown, her complexion is blotched, unmistakably piebald, with splattered, faded brown markings splashed liberally across her exposed flesh. Her features are soft and plain; a dark mouth coupled with a too wide forehead and stubborn chin. Nearly green, her long, hazel eyes are set with dark lashes and thick, expressive eyebrows. A tumble of ill-kept, unwashed hair reaches her shoulders. The wavy, dark locks are a tamed, browned shade of red. She is wearing:
a tri-colored pendant
a simple white shift dress
a pair of claws of the predator
She walks with the blessing of Haern.

You have emoted: Sibatti squints at you in the low light, her disgruntled expression melding into an easy smile. \"So I see. The last Mhun I encountered was, unfortunately, undead. He promptly turned my stomach. Are you of Moghedu?\"

Ambirle\&#39;s smile is a little too feral, closer to a snarl than a true grin. \"I\&#39;ve never set foot there,\" she admits. Tossing her head to send her red hair back across her shoulders, she explains, \"I\&#39;m from Shastaan, originally.\"

You have emoted: \"You\&#39;re not missing much,\" Sibatti scowls. She snorts sharply. \"But Shastaan - only been once, and never again. A Thrim there taught me that lesson quickly.\"
 
\"Ah, well,\" Ambirle scoffs, chin jerking roughly up and to one side. \"Things were much better before the Kerrithrim.\"
 
You say, \"Would assume so. Destroyed hometowns don\&#39;t make for happy memories.\"
 
Ambirle folds her hands, turning her sharp eyes back to you. \"So, tell me, Sibatti,\" she says the name elegantly, hard across the t\&#39;s. \"Have you read about the little project I\&#39;ve planned?\"
 
You have emoted: Peeling back the top of a worn satchel, Sibatti looks over a small pile of ledgers and scrolls peeking out from it. \"I.. uh. Don\&#39;t think so. I\&#39;ve had quite a bit of new projects dropped on me lately within the Pride.\"

You say, \"Is this project something for the Heartwood, or something private?\"
 
\"For the congregation,\" Ambirle corrects. \"Tell you what.\"

Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"If you have the time, you can show me to this shop you spoke of. And then I\&#39;ll tell you about it.\"
 
You say, \"It\&#39;s not far from here.. sure.\"
 
Ambirle begins to follow you.

<<Walking...>>

Ambirle follows you to the northwest.
Gryphon & Raven Sundries. (lost)
An argent intercessor is poised here, hefting an ancient-looking halberd in her glowing hands. A bust of a laughing child stands here. Resting on a solid wooden base, a statuette of a bevy of fireflies rests here. A slender statuette of a troubadour stands here. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading southeast(open) and down(closed).
 
Raenne arrives from the southeast.
 
Raenne leaves to the southeast.

You have emoted: Sibatti exhales a puff of air. \"Familiarity. No more streets.\" She offers you a weak smile. \"Can I get you anything?\"

You have emoted: Sibatti slides her palm over a small counter, nodding at a menu.

Ambirle stretches her arms, flexing her fingers beneath the curve of the claws she wears. Her lips twitch. \"It smells unfamiliar, to me. Do I smell goat meat?\"

You say to Ambirle, \"Goat.. crab.. chicken.. got something for everyone here, I do.\"
 
Sniffing, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"And something fishy, I think. Octopus? Aie, how odd.\"
 
You have emoted: \"And.. some things more exotic than that.\" Sibatti bites her lip through a smug grin.

The expression catches Ambirle\&#39;s eyes, and she grins, something approving in the gesture. \"Ahh, well. I think I\&#39;ll pass for now.\"
 
You have emoted: Sibatti vaults onto the shop counter, curling her legs around to her side. \"I hear you.\"
 
Ambirle scratches at the back of her neck, amazingly delicate with the threat of the metal claws across her knuckles. \"It\&#39;s about hunting. The short story is, I spoke with a Consanguine a while back. Claimed that his kind were the greatest hunters around. Tcha.\"
 
Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"I disagreed. I said it\&#39;s not about what you hunt, but -how- you hunt. So that\&#39;s what I\&#39;m curious about.\"
 
Ambirle tips her head, fixing her gaze. \"How we hunt. With what attitude, what mindset, what intent. What separates hunting from plain, faithless killing?\"

You have emoted: Sibatti inclines her head, listening to your words. Her eyes move over your face, concealing something.
 
Raenne arrives from the southeast.
 
Without hinting at the look of your eyes, Ambirle turns, pacing a few strides. \"I plan to put a book together, holding the congregation\&#39;s thoughts on it.\"

You have emoted: Sibatti breaks her gaze from Ambirle to nod at Raenne in welcoming.

You pull a hunter\&#39;s spear from your weaponbelt fluidly.
You begin to wield a hunter\&#39;s spear in your right hand.
 
Raenne nods back, pausing at the doorway - a moment of indecision precedes her entrance into the shop proper, her head ducked in a slight hunch. She begins to browse the wares, attempting to look unobtrusive.
 
You have emoted: Cradling her spear across her lap, Sibatti says to Ambirle, \"Hunting is something I pride myself in. The physical motions are one thing, but the spiritual experience I revel in.\"
 
Ambirle turns abruptly, an honest smile breaking her expression. \"Raenne!\" she enthuses. Just as quickly, she turns back to you, breathing out a sharp, excited breath. \"Exactly!\" she hisses, shoulders hunching in an unfinished crouch. \"That\&#39;s exactly what I want to write about, and get the congregation thinking on.\"
 
Raenne jumps at being addressed, peeking out from behind a counter - she huffs nervously, smoke rising from her nostrils, and musters a smile, lifting one claw in a timid little wave. \"I was, uh, just looking,\" she comments. Her voice trails off as she adds, \"If, if I\&#39;m, um, interrupting...\"
 
Glancing askance, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says, \"You know...\"
 
You have emoted: Sibatti stretches languidly upon the counter, the motion somewhat feline in manner. \"I am not much for words,\" she shrugs. \"I speak best through actions. If there is something I can impart, somehow.. I would not mind contributing.\"

You say to Raenne, \"There are no secrets in my shop. Feel free to look around.\"

\"I might insist that you do just that,\" Ambirle replies at a mutter, her attention lingering on Raenne. Intent, she adds to the Xoran. \"You\&#39;re fine, partner.\"

You say to Ambirle, \"You are friends?\"
 
Simply, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"Not yet.\"

Raenne: 
She is a lithe Xoran and is a petite woman, covered completely in slightly ridged, pale grey scales, that tend almost toward the translucent in their light hue. Her form is sleek and graceful, tapering from smooth, wiry musculature to the gentle points of her fingertips, feet, joints, and head - the rounded back of her skull extends frontward in the slightly exaggerated cone of a snout common to the race, with large, pink eyes set at either side of her head. She is wearing:
a white gi shirt of the Daru zealots
a pair of red gi pants of the Daru zealots with a tail slit
a crimson and ivory kitbag
a white brocade kimono with a red ibis
a suit of leather armour
 
Raenne inhales softly, her snout turning toward the back of the shop - a moment later her eyes fix on the menu, and she approaches to read it, raising a claw to trace the words. \"I\&#39;d, uh... I\&#39;d like... the crepes.\" Hesitating, she adds, with a downward glance to the floor. \"Five crepes. Do I tell you?\" she asks you, her eyes lifting for a moment, and then adds, \"Or someone else?\"

You have emoted: A shop attendant smiles at Raenne encouragingly. Sibatti says to Raenne, \"Merely express your intention to buy them. My attendant is quite capable of delivering it, if it is in stock.\"
 
\"Oh. Okay.\" Raenne hurries over to the counter, adding in a half-audible murmur, \"Sorry for bothering you.\" She meets the shop attendant\&#39;s eye, stumbling through her request, and steps back, fidgeting, as she waits.
 
\"It\&#39;s alright,\" Ambirle assures Raenne. Boldly, she approaches you, leaning an elbow on the counter quietly, her gaze remaining on Raenne even as she speaks.

Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says to you, \"Well? Will you help me?\"
 
Raenne buys some crepes.

You have emoted: Sibatti sits up and crosses her legs in one fluid motion, resting her palms on her knees. She balances her spear precariously on her thighs, sucking on her teeth thoughtfully. \"I will do so, if it aids the Hunter. A challenge from the creatures of dust and ill flesh could not be ignored by me.\"
 
Raenne, upon receiving the crepes, scoops them up, turning away from the counter. With a glance about as if to confirm that no one is watching her, she begins to eat, the manner in which she devours the crepes wolfish and hasty. All five vanish sooner rather than later, and she emits a satisfied huff of smoke before drawing closer to the conversing pair, seemingly to listen.
 
Raenne dips her fruit-filled crepe into a dollop of sweet cream before biting into it.
 
Raenne dips her fruit-filled crepe into a dollop of sweet cream before biting into it.
 
Raenne dips her fruit-filled crepe into a dollop of sweet cream before biting into it.
 
Raenne dips her fruit-filled crepe into a dollop of sweet cream before biting into it.
 
Raenne dips her fruit-filled crepe into a dollop of sweet cream before biting into it.
 
Ambirle makes a low, pleased growling noise, deep in her throat. \"Good,\" she murmurs.

You have emoted: Eyeing Raenne, Sibatti dips her gaze to the floor, concealing a small smile.

You cease to wield a hunter\&#39;s spear in your right hand, securing it conveniently on your weaponbelt.
 
Ambirle lifts herself straight, brushing past you to approach Raenne. She bobs to one side, curious. \"Hungry?\" she asks with an amused grin, leaning neatly towards the Xoran.
 
Raenne reaches up, wiping a trace of honey from her upper lip. She nods, and smiles, though a blush comes into her pale cheeks at the silent admission. \"My mother, she, she would have died seeing me eating like that.\" Gesturing with one claw, she comments, more to herself than Ambirle, \"Use the fork and knife, cut it up...\"
 
Ambirle laughs loudly and roughly. \"Don\&#39;t inhale your food, you\&#39;ll upset your stomach?\" she finishes helpfully.
 
Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl, \"Y, yeah!\" Her face splits into a grin. \"Haha...\"
 
Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"My mother was the same way.\" Her gaze darts to Sibatti. \"Meant to make a real proper lady out of me.\"
 
You have emoted: Sibatti twists her gaze away, her lip marked by a sharp and sudden bite. \"Yes.. mothers, heh.\"
 
Offhand, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says, \"Mine\&#39;s rich.\" She glances at the floor before taking a cross-legged seat on it. \"Yeleni. Daru.\" A pause. \"She wants to be proud of me.\"
 
Ambirle steps back, getting an arms length from Raenne and looking down. \"Yours is still alive?\"
 
\"Yeah.\" Raenne fidgets uncomfortably. \"She\&#39;s really old.\"
 
\"Mine died while she was young and beautiful,\" Ambirle replies, a stiff note of awkward pride in the statement.
 
Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"All the better. I wouldn\&#39;t have been able to stand her getting old.\"
 
You have emoted: Looking away from Raenne and Ambirle, Sibatti distracts herself by fidgeting with the menu, crossing off several entries marked \&#39;crepe\&#39;
 
\"My mother is beautiful too,\" butts in Raenne, a note of defensiveness in her tone. She doesn\&#39;t notice you, focused intently on Ambirle. \"She\&#39;s a Yeleni.\"
 
Ambirle shrugs her two toned shoulders, suddenly indifferent. She makes a show of working the leather straps of her claws, slowly undoing them. She speaks as she works, raising her voice in an effort to catch your attention. \"About the book. You don\&#39;t have to write anything. We could sit down and talk sometime, hmm? I\&#39;ll just write your thoughts for you, if you\&#39;d like.\"
 
Ambirle removes a pair of claws of the predator.
 
Raenne gives in to exhaustion, drifting off to sleep.
 
Raenne shifts slightly in her sleep.

You have emoted: Sibatti slowly returns her gaze to Ambirle, a lingering sadness upon her features. She rubs her hand over her face, shaking it off. \"That would be better,\" she answers finally. \"A talk, or even a demonstration.. an experience.\"
 
Raenne opens her eyes and stretches languidly, a smile on her face.

Defensively, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"I\&#39;m afraid I hunt alone. We\&#39;ll just talk, I think.\"

You have emoted: Sibatti shrugs, unfazed. \"Whichever.\"
 
Raenne, having slumped onto the floor, lies there, her eyes cracked half-open, a faint cloud of smoke drifting from her nostrils. Scarcely has she awoken when a snake slithers past her snout. The reaction is immediate; her claw lashes out, smashing in the snake\&#39;s head, and for good measure she punches it twice more, pulping its sinuous body.

Without turning, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"Easy there, partner.\"

Amusedly, you say to Raenne, \"You ever have snake?\"
 
Still half-asleep, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to you, \"-Was- a snake once.\"
 
Ambirle lays a hand on her hip, tipping her stance as she stares, hard, at you in her first real examination. There is a calm awareness in her gaze, and an undeniable interest that she makes no effort to conceal.
 
Raenne levers herself into a sitting position, wiping the sleep from her rosy eyes - she holds up the corpse, watching it dangle. A moment later, its tail falls off, plopping onto the floorboards. She flinches visibly.
 
The plop catches Ambirle\&#39;s attention, breaking her gaze. Offhandedly, she comments, \"Wish I could do that.\"

You have emoted: Sibatti gives a slightly puzzled look Raenne briefly. <--- oops 

Glancing up and catching the look, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to you, \"Syssin. Was a Syssin. Thirty, maybe forty years. Spinesreach. Wasn\&#39;t happy. Miss it sometimes. Liked snooping.\"
 
Raenne drops the snake into her lap, her voice trailing off, her eyes upon her feet. Her claws fold together as she continues to awaken, her gaze and demeanor gaining clarity with each passing moment.

Coldly, you say to Raenne, \"There is not much happiness to be found in constant subterfuge among the honest.\"
 
Merelii has been sliced apart by a Mhun city guard.

You have emoted: Sibatti flinches suddenly.
 
Her words almost inaudible, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to you, \"Daru now.\"
 
Ambirle holds up a finger to emphasize each word. \"Brutal honesty, partner.\"

You have emoted: \"Admirable choice..\" Sibatti mumbles, rubbing her temple briefly. \"I admire the martial discipline of monks.\"
 
\"I... was a dancer before.\" Raenne collects herself and rises to her feet. \"Tekura\&#39;s coming quickly. Telepathy and Illumination less so. Bad at Telepathy, not enough control on Illumination...\"

\"But you\&#39;re an Xoran!\" Ambirle exclaims. \"Fire should be second nature to you, no?\"
 
Raenne fumbles through her pockets, until she comes up with a blackened, charred shape - the remains of a handkerchief. Her expression is bleak and resigned. \"Sneezing,\" she explains. \"Every time. Premature fire. Same goes for Illumination. I have the power. No control. No finesse.\" She secrets away the handkerchief again. \"Makes me mad.\"
 
Ambirle lowers herself to a crouch, sitting on her heels so that she may address Raenne. \"Like me and my bear?\" she asks, head tipping. Without offering an explanation, she continues. \"I know how that is. But you can learn. I learned.\"
 
Beginning to pace, Raenne nods absently. \"Yeah...\" Her hands rise up, her stance changing - rather than her usual, slight hunch, there is sudden intent in her frame. Her claws, too, gain shape, curving into solidity. She brings them together, her eyes closing, smoke wafting from her nostrils. There\&#39;s a small grunt of effort, and she pulls her claws away, light bursting into relief throughout the room. With each step back from the source, she regains her previous timidity. \"I, I\&#39;m learning though...\"
 
Raenne stands up and stretches her arms out wide.

Raenne molds a brilliant orb into existence between her hands. As she places it on the ground, a radiant light illuminates everything in the area.

You have emoted: Sibatti idly fingers a few fragments of bone from her sleeves, shifting uncomfortably on the counter.

Mumbling to herself, you say, \"So that is what a Daru is..\"
 
Yielding back from the orb, Ambirle nods, smiling a brief, honest smile. \"You just need heart and desire,\" she decides, her statement frank.

Softly, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl, \"Yeah...\"
 
\"And while this has been pleasant,\" Ambirle continues at a drawl. \"I think we\&#39;ve overstayed our welcome, Raenne.\"
 
Raenne\&#39;s eyes fix on the fire - the glow sparkles on her gray scales, light dancing like sparks over her rippling skin. Not until Ambirle\&#39;s statement is she startled out of her reverie. \"Oh!\"
 
Miserably, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says, \"Sorry. I knew I was interrupting. I didn\&#39;t mean to, honest.\"

You have emoted: \"It\&#39;s the indoors,\" Sibatti offers somewhat apologetically. \"Not you. I don\&#39;t do well in long hours inside. I thought I was hiding it well. Mmgh.\"

Deepest Stygian night steals over the land as the symbolic hourglass empties and turns, ready to begin a new day.
It is now the 10th of Lanosian, year 301 of the Midnight Age.
Today is the first day of Autumn.

Turning your snout to the wind, you deeply inhale any scents from the air.
 
Without pride, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"I\&#39;m observant.\"
 
You say to Ambirle, \"Such is a Mhun.\"
 
\"Mayhaps,\" Ambirle relents. \"I wouldn\&#39;t quite know.\"

You have emoted: Sibatti slides from the counter to stand before Ambirle, frowning in concentration as she studies something in her eyes. Absently, she loosens a pair of brass knuckles from her fists.

You remove spiked knuckles.
 
Ambirle tips her gaze up, enough to meet your look. She doesn\&#39;t flinch, she doesn\&#39;t move. She waits, with an air of endless patience that could be, on its own, intimidating.

You have emoted: Sibatti holds out her arm stiffly, and somewhat awkwardly. \"This was.. interesting, to say the least,\" she says, a hint of curiosity lingering in her voice.
 
\"Fascinating,\" Ambirle corrects, grasping your offered hand in her own. For a moment, her mottled fingers overlap your palm, gold and brown over chestnut skin, before she releases the grip.
 
You have emoted: Sibatti jerks her head slightly at the remark, but soon shakes it off with a smile that is arresting, if lacking in warmth.
 
Raenne\&#39;s eyes travel between Ambirle and you - she observes in silence, her claws folded in front of her lap, her expression attentive but utterly neutral.

With a stiff politeness, you say to Raenne, \"It was a pleasure to meet you, Daru.\"
 
Ambirle bounces back lightly, her head bobbing. \"I\&#39;m off, then,\" she announces. Briefly, she says to Raenne. \"Told you I\&#39;d remember you.\" With a flick of her hand in a final farwell, she dashes.
 
Ambirle leaves to the southeast.
 
Her eyes turning to the floor, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to you, \"It, uh, it was a pleasure to, to meet you too... Sentinel.\"
 
Making for the door in a gait that more resembles a scuttle, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says, \"\&#39;Bye.\"

You have emoted: Sibatti folds her arms quietly.
 
Raenne leaves to the southeast.'>Sibatti:
She is a resilient Mhun of moderate height and musculature befitting of a survivalist. A brusque woman of the wilds, her chestnut skin is roughened by the elements, marred in several places by scrapes and light bruises. Unembellished and indelicate, she moves with a lithe agility that is more athletic than feminine. Her auburn hair is a tangle of braids, baubles, and feathers, an untamed mane of wild nature and utter disregard for vanity. Her manner is alert and unflinching, a caged ferocity evident in her feral presence. She is wearing:

She walks with the blessing of Haern.
Ambirle arrives from the southwest.
Ambirle slips into the alcove almost silently, propping her mottled shoulder against the entrance with a practiced, casual ease.
You incline your head politely to Ambirle.
Ambirle twists her finger into her hair, opens her mouth to speak, and then shuts it. Quietly, she begins instead, \"Pity. I come here to speak to you, and I come without a name.\"
You say to Ambirle, \"Don\'t think we\'ve ever met. I\'m the co-proprietor here, or my name would be on the shop too. It\'s Sibatti.\"
\"Of the annex?\" Ambirle asks, gesturing vaguely to the surroundings, her thick eyebrows lifting.
You have emoted: \"Annex?\" Sibatti repeats, eyebrows raised. \"Not sure what you refer to.\"
ql &lt;&lt;Soooo... I thought I was in my shop, srsly.>>
Cooking annex. (Enorian.)
An argent intercessor is poised here, hefting an ancient-looking halberd in her glowing hands. Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl is here. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading south and southwest.
Ambirle heaves a sigh, shakes her head, and lets the matter drop. \"I\'m Ambirle Dire,\" she explains, touching the pendant she wears around her throat. \"Do you know why I\'m here?\"
You have emoted: Sibatti cradles her forehead in her hand and sighs. \"I blame Raum for this. Sorry, I thought I was in my shop, and he\'d delivered me earlier without warning. Spare me a good laugh, I\'m still disoriented from it, I guess.\"
You have emoted: \"And no,\" Sibatti answers quietly, scratching at her throat. \"I don\'t believe I do.\"
Silence lingers for a moment before Ambirle laughs easily, tossing her head back. \"Ah, well. It happens to some, I suppose,\" she replies, offering no excuse. Pushing off the entrance she leans against, she takes a single step towards you, deftly changing the subject. \"Can\'t say I\'ve seen another of my kind in a while.\"
You push the mask up over your head, removing it.
Ambirle:
She is a muscular Mhun of wiry grace. Her small frame is lean and soft, near feline. Lithe limbs lend her an agile lankiness despite her short height. Hands both wide and coarse have dirty, ragged fingernails. Her palms are lined with faded, unnatural marks. Another marking wraps her upper arm, a long, sinuous rune creasing her skin. Tanned a golden brown, her complexion is blotched, unmistakably piebald, with splattered, faded brown markings splashed liberally across her exposed flesh. Her features are soft and plain; a dark mouth coupled with a too wide forehead and stubborn chin. Nearly green, her long, hazel eyes are set with dark lashes and thick, expressive eyebrows. A tumble of ill-kept, unwashed hair reaches her shoulders. The wavy, dark locks are a tamed, browned shade of red. She is wearing:
a tri-colored pendant
a simple white shift dress
a pair of claws of the predator
She walks with the blessing of Haern.
You have emoted: Sibatti squints at you in the low light, her disgruntled expression melding into an easy smile. \"So I see. The last Mhun I encountered was, unfortunately, undead. He promptly turned my stomach. Are you of Moghedu?\"
Ambirle\'s smile is a little too feral, closer to a snarl than a true grin. \"I\'ve never set foot there,\" she admits. Tossing her head to send her red hair back across her shoulders, she explains, \"I\'m from Shastaan, originally.\"
You have emoted: \"You\'re not missing much,\" Sibatti scowls. She snorts sharply. \"But Shastaan - only been once, and never again. A Thrim there taught me that lesson quickly.\"
\"Ah, well,\" Ambirle scoffs, chin jerking roughly up and to one side. \"Things were much better before the Kerrithrim.\"
You say, \"Would assume so. Destroyed hometowns don\'t make for happy memories.\"
Ambirle folds her hands, turning her sharp eyes back to you. \"So, tell me, Sibatti,\" she says the name elegantly, hard across the t\'s. \"Have you read about the little project I\'ve planned?\"
You have emoted: Peeling back the top of a worn satchel, Sibatti looks over a small pile of ledgers and scrolls peeking out from it. \"I.. uh. Don\'t think so. I\'ve had quite a bit of new projects dropped on me lately within the Pride.\"
You say, \"Is this project something for the Heartwood, or something private?\"
\"For the congregation,\" Ambirle corrects. \"Tell you what.\"
Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"If you have the time, you can show me to this shop you spoke of. And then I\'ll tell you about it.\"
You say, \"It\'s not far from here.. sure.\"
Ambirle begins to follow you.
&lt;&lt;Walking...>>
Ambirle follows you to the northwest.
Gryphon & Raven Sundries. (lost)
An argent intercessor is poised here, hefting an ancient-looking halberd in her glowing hands. A bust of a laughing child stands here. Resting on a solid wooden base, a statuette of a bevy of fireflies rests here. A slender statuette of a troubadour stands here. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading southeast(open) and down(closed).
Raenne arrives from the southeast.
Raenne leaves to the southeast.
You have emoted: Sibatti exhales a puff of air. \"Familiarity. No more streets.\" She offers you a weak smile. \"Can I get you anything?\"
You have emoted: Sibatti slides her palm over a small counter, nodding at a menu.
Ambirle stretches her arms, flexing her fingers beneath the curve of the claws she wears. Her lips twitch. \"It smells unfamiliar, to me. Do I smell goat meat?\"
You say to Ambirle, \"Goat.. crab.. chicken.. got something for everyone here, I do.\"
Sniffing, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"And something fishy, I think. Octopus? Aie, how odd.\"
You have emoted: \"And.. some things more exotic than that.\" Sibatti bites her lip through a smug grin.
The expression catches Ambirle\'s eyes, and she grins, something approving in the gesture. \"Ahh, well. I think I\'ll pass for now.\"
You have emoted: Sibatti vaults onto the shop counter, curling her legs around to her side. \"I hear you.\"
Ambirle scratches at the back of her neck, amazingly delicate with the threat of the metal claws across her knuckles. \"It\'s about hunting. The short story is, I spoke with a Consanguine a while back. Claimed that his kind were the greatest hunters around. Tcha.\"
Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"I disagreed. I said it\'s not about what you hunt, but -how- you hunt. So that\'s what I\'m curious about.\"
Ambirle tips her head, fixing her gaze. \"How we hunt. With what attitude, what mindset, what intent. What separates hunting from plain, faithless killing?\"
You have emoted: Sibatti inclines her head, listening to your words. Her eyes move over your face, concealing something.
Raenne arrives from the southeast.
Without hinting at the look of your eyes, Ambirle turns, pacing a few strides. \"I plan to put a book together, holding the congregation\'s thoughts on it.\"
You have emoted: Sibatti breaks her gaze from Ambirle to nod at Raenne in welcoming.
You pull a hunter\'s spear from your weaponbelt fluidly.
You begin to wield a hunter\'s spear in your right hand.
Raenne nods back, pausing at the doorway - a moment of indecision precedes her entrance into the shop proper, her head ducked in a slight hunch. She begins to browse the wares, attempting to look unobtrusive.
You have emoted: Cradling her spear across her lap, Sibatti says to Ambirle, \"Hunting is something I pride myself in. The physical motions are one thing, but the spiritual experience I revel in.\"
Ambirle turns abruptly, an honest smile breaking her expression. \"Raenne!\" she enthuses. Just as quickly, she turns back to you, breathing out a sharp, excited breath. \"Exactly!\" she hisses, shoulders hunching in an unfinished crouch. \"That\'s exactly what I want to write about, and get the congregation thinking on.\"
Raenne jumps at being addressed, peeking out from behind a counter - she huffs nervously, smoke rising from her nostrils, and musters a smile, lifting one claw in a timid little wave. \"I was, uh, just looking,\" she comments. Her voice trails off as she adds, \"If, if I\'m, um, interrupting...\"
Glancing askance, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says, \"You know...\"
You have emoted: Sibatti stretches languidly upon the counter, the motion somewhat feline in manner. \"I am not much for words,\" she shrugs. \"I speak best through actions. If there is something I can impart, somehow.. I would not mind contributing.\"
You say to Raenne, \"There are no secrets in my shop. Feel free to look around.\"
\"I might insist that you do just that,\" Ambirle replies at a mutter, her attention lingering on Raenne. Intent, she adds to the Xoran. \"You\'re fine, partner.\"
You say to Ambirle, \"You are friends?\"
Simply, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"Not yet.\"
Raenne:
She is a lithe Xoran and is a petite woman, covered completely in slightly ridged, pale grey scales, that tend almost toward the translucent in their light hue. Her form is sleek and graceful, tapering from smooth, wiry musculature to the gentle points of her fingertips, feet, joints, and head - the rounded back of her skull extends frontward in the slightly exaggerated cone of a snout common to the race, with large, pink eyes set at either side of her head. She is wearing:
a white gi shirt of the Daru zealots
a pair of red gi pants of the Daru zealots with a tail slit
a crimson and ivory kitbag
a white brocade kimono with a red ibis
a suit of leather armour
Raenne inhales softly, her snout turning toward the back of the shop - a moment later her eyes fix on the menu, and she approaches to read it, raising a claw to trace the words. \"I\'d, uh... I\'d like... the crepes.\" Hesitating, she adds, with a downward glance to the floor. \"Five crepes. Do I tell you?\" she asks you, her eyes lifting for a moment, and then adds, \"Or someone else?\"
You have emoted: A shop attendant smiles at Raenne encouragingly. Sibatti says to Raenne, \"Merely express your intention to buy them. My attendant is quite capable of delivering it, if it is in stock.\"
\"Oh. Okay.\" Raenne hurries over to the counter, adding in a half-audible murmur, \"Sorry for bothering you.\" She meets the shop attendant\'s eye, stumbling through her request, and steps back, fidgeting, as she waits.
\"It\'s alright,\" Ambirle assures Raenne. Boldly, she approaches you, leaning an elbow on the counter quietly, her gaze remaining on Raenne even as she speaks.
Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says to you, \"Well? Will you help me?\"
Raenne buys some crepes.
You have emoted: Sibatti sits up and crosses her legs in one fluid motion, resting her palms on her knees. She balances her spear precariously on her thighs, sucking on her teeth thoughtfully. \"I will do so, if it aids the Hunter. A challenge from the creatures of dust and ill flesh could not be ignored by me.\"
Raenne, upon receiving the crepes, scoops them up, turning away from the counter. With a glance about as if to confirm that no one is watching her, she begins to eat, the manner in which she devours the crepes wolfish and hasty. All five vanish sooner rather than later, and she emits a satisfied huff of smoke before drawing closer to the conversing pair, seemingly to listen.
Raenne dips her fruit-filled crepe into a dollop of sweet cream before biting into it.
Raenne dips her fruit-filled crepe into a dollop of sweet cream before biting into it.

Raenne dips her fruit-filled crepe into a dollop of sweet cream before biting into it.
Ambirle makes a low, pleased growling noise, deep in her throat. \"Good,\" she murmurs.
You have emoted: Eyeing Raenne, Sibatti dips her gaze to the floor, concealing a small smile.
You cease to wield a hunter\'s spear in your right hand, securing it conveniently on your weaponbelt.
Ambirle lifts herself straight, brushing past you to approach Raenne. She bobs to one side, curious. \"Hungry?\" she asks with an amused grin, leaning neatly towards the Xoran.
Raenne reaches up, wiping a trace of honey from her upper lip. She nods, and smiles, though a blush comes into her pale cheeks at the silent admission. \"My mother, she, she would have died seeing me eating like that.\" Gesturing with one claw, she comments, more to herself than Ambirle, \"Use the fork and knife, cut it up...\"
Ambirle laughs loudly and roughly. \"Don\'t inhale your food, you\'ll upset your stomach?\" she finishes helpfully.
Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl, \"Y, yeah!\" Her face splits into a grin. \"Haha...\"
Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"My mother was the same way.\" Her gaze darts to Sibatti. \"Meant to make a real proper lady out of me.\"
You have emoted: Sibatti twists her gaze away, her lip marked by a sharp and sudden bite. \"Yes.. mothers, heh.\"
Offhand, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says, \"Mine\'s rich.\" She glances at the floor before taking a cross-legged seat on it. \"Yeleni. Daru.\" A pause. \"She wants to be proud of me.\"
Ambirle steps back, getting an arms length from Raenne and looking down. \"Yours is still alive?\"
\"Yeah.\" Raenne fidgets uncomfortably. \"She\'s really old.\"
\"Mine died while she was young and beautiful,\" Ambirle replies, a stiff note of awkward pride in the statement.
Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"All the better. I wouldn\'t have been able to stand her getting old.\"
You have emoted: Looking away from Raenne and Ambirle, Sibatti distracts herself by fidgeting with the menu, crossing off several entries marked \'crepe\'
\"My mother is beautiful too,\" butts in Raenne, a note of defensiveness in her tone. She doesn\'t notice you, focused intently on Ambirle. \"She\'s a Yeleni.\"
Ambirle shrugs her two toned shoulders, suddenly indifferent. She makes a show of working the leather straps of her claws, slowly undoing them. She speaks as she works, raising her voice in an effort to catch your attention. \"About the book. You don\'t have to write anything. We could sit down and talk sometime, hmm? I\'ll just write your thoughts for you, if you\'d like.\"
Ambirle removes a pair of claws of the predator.
Raenne gives in to exhaustion, drifting off to sleep.
Raenne shifts slightly in her sleep.
You have emoted: Sibatti slowly returns her gaze to Ambirle, a lingering sadness upon her features. She rubs her hand over her face, shaking it off. \"That would be better,\" she answers finally. \"A talk, or even a demonstration.. an experience.\"
Raenne opens her eyes and stretches languidly, a smile on her face.
Defensively, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"I\'m afraid I hunt alone. We\'ll just talk, I think.\"
You have emoted: Sibatti shrugs, unfazed. \"Whichever.\"
Raenne, having slumped onto the floor, lies there, her eyes cracked half-open, a faint cloud of smoke drifting from her nostrils. Scarcely has she awoken when a snake slithers past her snout. The reaction is immediate; her claw lashes out, smashing in the snake\'s head, and for good measure she punches it twice more, pulping its sinuous body.
Without turning, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"Easy there, partner.\"
Amusedly, you say to Raenne, \"You ever have snake?\"
Still half-asleep, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to you, \"-Was- a snake once.\"
Ambirle lays a hand on her hip, tipping her stance as she stares, hard, at you in her first real examination. There is a calm awareness in her gaze, and an undeniable interest that she makes no effort to conceal.
Raenne levers herself into a sitting position, wiping the sleep from her rosy eyes - she holds up the corpse, watching it dangle. A moment later, its tail falls off, plopping onto the floorboards. She flinches visibly.
The plop catches Ambirle\'s attention, breaking her gaze. Offhandedly, she comments, \"Wish I could do that.\"
You have emoted: Sibatti gives a slightly puzzled look Raenne briefly. &lt;--- oops
Glancing up and catching the look, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to you, \"Syssin. Was a Syssin. Thirty, maybe forty years. Spinesreach. Wasn\'t happy. Miss it sometimes. Liked snooping.\"
Raenne drops the snake into her lap, her voice trailing off, her eyes upon her feet. Her claws fold together as she continues to awaken, her gaze and demeanor gaining clarity with each passing moment.
Coldly, you say to Raenne, \"There is not much happiness to be found in constant subterfuge among the honest.\"
Merelii has been sliced apart by a Mhun city guard.
You have emoted: Sibatti flinches suddenly.
Her words almost inaudible, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to you, \"Daru now.\"
Ambirle holds up a finger to emphasize each word. \"Brutal honesty, partner.\"
You have emoted: \"Admirable choice..\" Sibatti mumbles, rubbing her temple briefly. \"I admire the martial discipline of monks.\"
\"I... was a dancer before.\" Raenne collects herself and rises to her feet. \"Tekura\'s coming quickly. Telepathy and Illumination less so. Bad at Telepathy, not enough control on Illumination...\"
\"But you\'re an Xoran!\" Ambirle exclaims. \"Fire should be second nature to you, no?\"
Raenne fumbles through her pockets, until she comes up with a blackened, charred shape - the remains of a handkerchief. Her expression is bleak and resigned. \"Sneezing,\" she explains. \"Every time. Premature fire. Same goes for Illumination. I have the power. No control. No finesse.\" She secrets away the handkerchief again. \"Makes me mad.\"
Ambirle lowers herself to a crouch, sitting on her heels so that she may address Raenne. \"Like me and my bear?\" she asks, head tipping. Without offering an explanation, she continues. \"I know how that is. But you can learn. I learned.\"
Beginning to pace, Raenne nods absently. \"Yeah...\" Her hands rise up, her stance changing - rather than her usual, slight hunch, there is sudden intent in her frame. Her claws, too, gain shape, curving into solidity. She brings them together, her eyes closing, smoke wafting from her nostrils. There\'s a small grunt of effort, and she pulls her claws away, light bursting into relief throughout the room. With each step back from the source, she regains her previous timidity. \"I, I\'m learning though...\"
Raenne stands up and stretches her arms out wide.
Raenne molds a brilliant orb into existence between her hands. As she places it on the ground, a radiant light illuminates everything in the area.
You have emoted: Sibatti idly fingers a few fragments of bone from her sleeves, shifting uncomfortably on the counter.
Mumbling to herself, you say, \"So that is what a Daru is..\"
Yielding back from the orb, Ambirle nods, smiling a brief, honest smile. \"You just need heart and desire,\" she decides, her statement frank.
Softly, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl, \"Yeah...\"
\"And while this has been pleasant,\" Ambirle continues at a drawl. \"I think we\'ve overstayed our welcome, Raenne.\"
Raenne\'s eyes fix on the fire - the glow sparkles on her gray scales, light dancing like sparks over her rippling skin. Not until Ambirle\'s statement is she startled out of her reverie. \"Oh!\"
Miserably, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says, \"Sorry. I knew I was interrupting. I didn\'t mean to, honest.\"
You have emoted: \"It\'s the indoors,\" Sibatti offers somewhat apologetically. \"Not you. I don\'t do well in long hours inside. I thought I was hiding it well. Mmgh.\"
Deepest Stygian night steals over the land as the symbolic hourglass empties and turns, ready to begin a new day.
It is now the 10th of Lanosian, year 301 of the Midnight Age.
Today is the first day of Autumn.
Turning your snout to the wind, you deeply inhale any scents from the air.
Without pride, Milmaghe Ambirle Dire, Blackthorn Sibyl says, \"I\'m observant.\"
You say to Ambirle, \"Such is a Mhun.\"
\"Mayhaps,\" Ambirle relents. \"I wouldn\'t quite know.\"
You have emoted: Sibatti slides from the counter to stand before Ambirle, frowning in concentration as she studies something in her eyes. Absently, she loosens a pair of brass knuckles from her fists.
You remove spiked knuckles.
Ambirle tips her gaze up, enough to meet your look. She doesn\'t flinch, she doesn\'t move. She waits, with an air of endless patience that could be, on its own, intimidating.
You have emoted: Sibatti holds out her arm stiffly, and somewhat awkwardly. \"This was.. interesting, to say the least,\" she says, a hint of curiosity lingering in her voice.
\"Fascinating,\" Ambirle corrects, grasping your offered hand in her own. For a moment, her mottled fingers overlap your palm, gold and brown over chestnut skin, before she releases the grip.
You have emoted: Sibatti jerks her head slightly at the remark, but soon shakes it off with a smile that is arresting, if lacking in warmth.
Raenne\'s eyes travel between Ambirle and you - she observes in silence, her claws folded in front of her lap, her expression attentive but utterly neutral.
With a stiff politeness, you say to Raenne, \"It was a pleasure to meet you, Daru.\"
Ambirle bounces back lightly, her head bobbing. \"I\'m off, then,\" she announces. Briefly, she says to Raenne. \"Told you I\'d remember you.\" With a flick of her hand in a final farwell, she dashes.
Ambirle leaves to the southeast.
Her eyes turning to the floor, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says to you, \"It, uh, it was a pleasure to, to meet you too... Sentinel.\"
Making for the door in a gait that more resembles a scuttle, Seeker of Purity, Raenne Fiadhaich-Prime says, \"\'Bye.\"
You have emoted: Sibatti folds her arms quietly.
Raenne leaves to the southeast.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+1 points with 1 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f75335a27f4be80c46a827657703d3d3?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by herknight@xxx on 06 May 2010</p>This was awesome.
