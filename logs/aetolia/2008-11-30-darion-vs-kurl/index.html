Caves in the Arena.
Particles of dust swarm the room, blocking your sight. Like sharp teeth, a few stalagmites reach up from the ground here. A noble falcon is perched
here, its bright eyes regarding you watchfully. A large pile of pointed stones prevents passage to the east. A large pile of pointed stones prevents
passage to the south. A large pile of pointed stones prevents passage to the west.
You see exits leading east, south and west.
