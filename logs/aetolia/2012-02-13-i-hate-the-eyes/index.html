At this proximity she must angle her head down to keep her lock on Emelle&#39;s eyes, and in them there is definite interest, the way one looks forward to going to work. "Is it the claws?" she asks, unfurling a hand, putting the daggerlike things on display.

"No." Emelle&#39;s index finger twitches. That errant movement aside, she remains standing very still, her palm still facing you.

Emelle murmurs, "More."

You have emoted: "Teeth? Muscles?" Lin tugs back her lip to show off her fangs, her eyebrows rising in a whimsical fashion that borders on the sarcastic. Then she flexes one arm, a bicep that would put your typical male warrior to shame.

Emelle smiles knowingly. Though her milky gaze remains unfocused and blank, somehow she seems to understand your display. "No," she repeats.

Dropping her arms to her sides, you say, "In what way do you see power in me, Emelle? And do you think I see the same in you?"

A moth flutters in from the up.

Emelle drops her hand suddenly, her empty stare seeming to follow the moth as it flutters around. "I hear you," she singsongs.

Returning her attention to you, Emelle regards you momentarily. "It vibrates," she states simply. "But I don&#39;t know if you see it in me."

You have emoted: Lin taps Emelle on the head as if to check to see if it is hollow. It seems that her opinion of Emelle&#39;s mental capacity falters slightly, and she takes on a resigned frown, but something catches her attention, making her ears twitch. "I don&#39;t see it," she says quietly. "Why don&#39;t you explain it to me."

Flinching at your touch, Emelle inhales sharply. "Power?" she queries, apparently ignorant of her lack of clarity.

You have emoted: Lin paces away from Emelle, her hands clasping behind her back, tail meandering about out of sync with her gait. "I can clearly see you are a... gifted one. Go on. Explain power to me. What is power? Do you want power?"

Emelle leans forward onto the balls of her feet, then back onto her heels. "Power is energy," she responds. She speaks slowly, as though savoring the words. "It comes from knowledge. Strength. Emotion. Ability." Hesitating, she turns her head to the side, obscuring her empty gaze from you. "Power is the balance between control and chaos."

You have emoted: "Well," Lin says softly, "I suppose two out of four is not bad. Be honest with me, Emelle. What are you, really?" She turns on her heel to face Emelle once more, screwing up her face as she more or less gawks at her. "Madwoman? An old Spirean opium habit gone wrong? Perhaps you saw a grisly death and your mind snapped?"

Emelle smirks, her features darkening. "What am I?" she returns, her words laced with a hint of bitterness. "If only I knew. I am not sighted, but I see." She sighs. "I&#39;m no more or less mad than the next person."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "A blind one, like Me. How well does she see, Speaker Mine?"

You have emoted: Lin frowns thoughtfully, then something snaps. She walks right up to Emelle, no more than an arm&#39;s length away, and waves her hand right in front of her face.

<<Order>>: You say, "Ah, You read my thoughts, Mother. Let us see."

<<Order>>: You say, "I feel utterly embarrassed - it did not even occur to me she could not see. You... have a way of attracting very odd people."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "It is My way. She has been through My mind many a time. I saw her but never hunted her, never sent My things after her. She seemed at ease. There was no fear."

In a deft movement, Emelle reaches up and grips your wrist, wrapping her fingers tightly around it. She isn&#39;t strong by comparison, but her grasp is firm.

<<Order>>: Omei says, "And I see why!"

<<Order>>: You say, "Tcha! Feisty one."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "VERY good."

You have emoted: Lin grunts, flexing her fist in a way that makes her wrist pulse in Emelle&#39;s hand. Her mouth cracks into an utterly pleased smile. "Well, don&#39;t I feel foolish," she says, her voice gone sultry.

You have emoted: "State your intention for being here," Lin demands of Emelle, quite content to leave her hand in Emelle&#39;s grasp.

Emelle&#39;s grip slackens briefly as she appears to consider releasing you, but she then tightens it again. "I was exploring," she replies, her tone even. "I&#39;ve been gone a long time. I met Ingram on the way. I remember his face."

You have emoted: "You remember-- you remember a soundshape, a vibration?" Lin asks speculatively. Her interest piqued, her tail slashes at the grass.

Emelle shakes her head. "I remember the shape of it. I felt it a long time ago, and I felt it again. When I touch, I imagine."

Emelle says, "There are many ways to see."

You have emoted: Lin nods soberly, understanding finally imprinted in her thick head. "That there are. That you are alive - and I sense you have lived long, despite your... lack of power - is a testament to your acuity. What can Mother Omei do for you?"

(Order): Levi says, "How is everyone?"

You feel the temperature around you to be about 52 F. The air is nearly completely still. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky.

(Order): You say, "Cold, but too excitable to care."

(Order): You say, "You? Still in that ceremony?"

(Order): Levi says, "Four and a half days was enough for me."

(Order): You say, "Godspit and shit."

(Order): Levi says, "Expecially when they were going in circles."

At this, Emelle releases you from her grasp and brushes her bangs out of her dull eyes. "I&#39;ve been gone for a century or so, somewhere else. I don&#39;t know where, a realm of dreams? I got some clarity." She frowns. "I want to understand my Nightmares. I want to learn to use my emotions instead of straining against them. It makes me weak." Pausing, she inhales slowly, then exhales. "I can&#39;t be powerful without using everything that I have. I want Her to help me understand, and I want to give my sight to Her."

You have emoted: Lin smooths the fur along her wrist on her brow, and paces around Emelle, pausing behind her, putting herself between the tsol&#39;aa woman and the lake. "She is here," she says quietly. "She hears you and She sees you in the black pits of Her eyes. Tell Her aloud what nightmares haunt you."

You say, "Tell her what keeps you up at night."

Emelle closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. "It doesn&#39;t keep me up. It keeps me down. Sometimes I can&#39;t escape it." Tilting her head upward, eyes still closed, she inhales again. "I am lost. I am not asleep, but not awake. Not comfortable, but not in pain. I wander in familiar dark for hours, days, years. No sense of time. Somehow I stumble, though I don&#39;t walk, and I fall almost endlessly, my being writhing and tearing at the core. I asphyxiate. Over and over again."

The recall is apparently difficult, and a shudder wracks Emelle&#39;s body. "Sometimes I see colors, and they blind me. Other times I can read, all the symbols of the world, and I can feel them. All the world&#39;s knowledge makes my head explode."

With wonder, Emelle adds, "I always die..." and falls silent.

(The Benandanti Consulate): Soramizu says, "Today even more than other days, I feel tremendously lucky to be a Duiranite."

(The Benandanti Consulate): You say, "Why is that?"

(The Benandanti Consulate): Soramizu says, "The Enorianites are quarreling. I need not mull over a solution to their troubles, and even I have a headache."

You have emoted: A pair of hands curl over Emelle&#39;s shoulders. The claws are razor sharp, but merely rest with an uncomfortable prickle. Lin leans in close, her hair bristling against Emelle&#39;s cheek. She speaks in a hush, her voice kept private for her.

You murmur to Emelle, "Are you afraid to die, tsol&#39;aa girl...?"

You project the hallucination into the mind of Emelle.
The claws bite into your flesh, the mere threat of pain, having easily breached your shirt.

Emelle winces, but does not cry out, instead taking a deep breath to steady herself. She softly replies, "No. Not after a thousand different times, a thousand different ways."

You murmur to Emelle, "Are you afraid of senselessness? Are you afraid of things getting... mixed up? Overwhelming you?"

You project the hallucination into the mind of Emelle.
Now they pierce the skin, but not enough to draw blood. It is a slow, clinical thing, like an injection in ten points.

Moaning softly, Emelle&#39;s voice catches in her throat. "Sometimes--" she chokes out.

You have emoted: Lin emits a pleasurable, low-voiced groan, like working through a good stretch. Her eyes flicker shut, and she whispers to Emelle at length.

You murmur to Emelle, "Sometimes... sometimes it drowns you, too much for one person&#39;s brain to process. You can hear the heartbeat of every person around you for miles. You see demons in people&#39;s eyes. There is always a noise, a crunch, a crush, pulsing through your skull. You black out, you close your eyes and someone else opens them. You forget which way is up."

You project the hallucination into the mind of Emelle.
Her palms tighten and her fingers shift, but there is no further pain, only the hint of it. Her pulse can be felt in her wrists as they rest on your shoulders.

Emelle bows her head in a silent gesture of acknowledgement.

You have emoted: The claws withdraw with a strange sliding feel. Lin embraces Emelle from behind, enveloping her in her crossed. "You poor thing, I am so sorry. Would you like the sensations to stop?"

Emelle&#39;s body twitches as your claws slide out of her. She allows the embrace, but her body remains taut. "They never stop."

You have emoted: "Then there is only one direction you can go," Lin murmurs. Her hands have not moved, but one turns up, revealing a ball of myrrh gum. It is held up for Emelle to take. Lin snaps her teeth together audibly, the clearest instruction she can give for what to do with the thing.

You project the hallucination into the mind of Emelle.
It smells unnatural, as if the thing had been stowed away in the incense bins of many generations of Djeirani merchants. But something else is afoot - a pressure in your head, static electricity.

Sensing the movement, Emelle places one of her hands over yours. Her fingers curl around the ball, and she grasps it between her thumb and fingers, rolling it back and forth momentarily.

Emelle lifts the ball to her face, presses it to her lips, and inhales its scent. Then, she pushes the object into her mouth.

Emelle eats a ball of myrrh gum.

You have emoted: "Things are going to get a little heavy," Lin says softly, her grip on Emelle tightening. Her heart pounds in tactile rhythm against her back. "I hope you can swim."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "I am there. INSIDE Her. Hold her for Me. I do not intend to show her mercy. Mercy is something My toys EARN."

Emelle suddenly writhes in your grasp. Though she struggles, she does not appear to be attempting to break away.

<<Order>>: You say, "Drown her, Mother. Sink her so deep that she must swim to the surface, or die."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "Yes. You don&#39;t DARE let go of her."

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s claws sink into Emelle&#39;s arms without mercy, wine stains of blood blooming beneath her shirt. She whispers continually, never in the same tongue - incantations, oaths, heady promises of lust or violence that would make anyone&#39;s toes curl, if only they could be understood.

You murmur to Emelle in Harpy, "Burn you, little girl... spread your ribcage apart and curl up in your chest..."

Her body convulsing, Emelle gasps for air. Her muscles tense at the pain of your sharp claws, but she makes nary a sound aside from the occasional desperate gasp for oxygen.

Omei manifests, Her claws wound fiendishly around Emelle&#39;s throat, Her laughter bubbling up like the harsh crash of waves against a beach of stones; She is strangling her, Her very fingers like ice, visions of drowning and water and darkness pouring out over her as droplets of Her Divine blood dot and stain and taint her hair.

Omei murmurs something softly to Emelle.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s voice rumbles deep - she is a primal beast, a saber cat, clutching Emelle to her breast. Her sepulchral growl trails off into a breathy laugh of delight. "Keep swimming, phantom... and pray there is air above the water."

Emelle whimpers quietly before a change overcomes her features. Her body slackens as she surrenders herself to Omei&#39;s grasp.

Struggling to speak, Emelle swallows hard, then manages to say simply: "Yes."

Omei murmurs something softly to Emelle.

Her voice a guttural growl, not too far distant from the roar of a thunderstorm, Omei, the Unfettered Nightmare says to Emelle, in Tsol&#39;aa, "TELL. ME. MY. NAME."

You have emoted: Though she cannot understand most of the exchange being made, Lin flashes a fierce smile, her eyes widening as she thrills at the sound of Omei&#39;s voice, a gasp escaping her lips.

The muscles of her body tightening, Emelle&#39;s head lolls back as she tenses. "Omei!" she yells, her voice caught somewhere between pain and pleasure.

In silence, a smile gracing Her ugly, bloodstained features, Omei loosens Her fingers, and allows Emelle to breathe. Her own breathing is ragged, as though She has been running, hunting, rather than the simple act of asphyxiation, and She runs Her fingers over her hair, threading the strands through Her claws.

<<Order>>: You say, "Should I... should I let her go? Gods..."

<<Order>>: Omei says, "Hold her until she is done."

Emelle gasps terribly, readily gulping in the air. Her eyelids fly open to reveal her faded eyes again, and they almost appear somehow wild. She wheezes with the effort of breathing.

Emelle coughs softly.

You have emoted: Lin holds tight, drawing blood freely from Emelle&#39;s arms, keeping her from moving overmuch. She looks as if she has seen a ghost, the fur on her arms and cheeks standing on end. She shushes Emelle gently, whispering, "Good girl..."

"Good girl," Omei murmurs, Her voice soft, low, almost husky with some indefinite emotion. She creeps close, gazing at both you and Emelle, leaning down as She continues to bestow Her strange affection on her. "That&#39;s a GOOD girl."

Emelle turns her face toward Omei and bows her head, though whether in reverence or exhaustion it is difficult to tell.

You have emoted: Lin finds her cheeks turning red, a heavy, fearful tremble in her arms as her breath draws short.

A look of bewilderment suddenly etching itself on her face, Emelle regarding Omei with wonder, with her unseeing eyes.

Her voice filled with childlike wonder, with a warm, possessive affection, Omei, the Unfettered Nightmare asks Emelle, "And though you see not, you see more than others. Will you be My new Seer, someday? Will you do that, for Me? Become strong? Fight for your air just as you should, little phantom?"

You have emoted: Lin gasps again. If Emelle could but see, she would know the gallimaufry of emotions in Lin&#39;s face to be that wonder, awe, jealousy. Her claws slide from Emelle&#39;s arms with an audible slurp, and though she continues to hold her tight, it is the embrace of a sister, not a captor.

Emelle smiles almost wildly, nodding affirmatively. "I want to use my sight. I will use it for You, and learn to become strong from You."

Emelle leans back against you, her body finally relaxing in your embrace.

Omei murmurs something softly to Emelle.

Omei raises Her head, turning Her sightless gaze to you; a small smile is on Her lips, a strange expression of contentment there on Her face. Out She reaches, touching Her hand to your cheek, exhaling slowly, Her breath like a snake&#39;s rattle.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s voice comes out in a creak, her mouth ajar, a shiver of fear coursing through her body. She stares into Omei&#39;s pitted face with adoration, gulping so hard it makes her throat pulse.

Her voice a benediction, a lover&#39;s murmur, Omei, the Unfettered Nightmare says to you, "GOOD girl."

Moths peeling away from Her one by one, Omei dissolves, She and the moths vanishing into thin air in a burst of riotous purple.

Emelle is lying on the ground flat on her back, limbs askew, blood spattered over her. Her chest rises and falls heavily with the effort of breathing.

You have emoted: Lin curls her arms around her body for a moment, her eyes somewhere else entirely. She shivers again in a fashion that would draw lewd attention, with a breathy sound that would suggest indecent activity. The spell is gone as suddenly as it game, and she watches Emelle with a fascinated look to her, reaching out to press two fingers over her heart.

At your touch, Emelle lifts her head off the ground with some effort. Much of her hair has escaped its binding, and it falls thickly over her shoulders. She gazes emptily at you, but her expression appears different somehow.

You have emoted: Lin stares deeply into Emelle&#39;s eyes. Liberated by the sightlessness of her accomplice, her expressions are unguarded, and she wears a look of raw curiosity. Despite this, she keeps her voice level, though it comes out quivery. "Is this where you need to be, Emelle?"

Emelle smiles, but with more meaning than she had previously. "Yes," she replies, reveling in the feeling of the word on her tongue. Her expression betrays awe and wonder.

You have emoted: "Drowning... I cannot imagine what that must have felt like. We all have our horrors, little Emelle - I cannot stand expressionlessness. Ingram is afraid of unpredictability." Lin tugs aside a lock of Emelle&#39;s hair and tosses it casually over her shoulder. "But you know now not to run from your Nightmares... you will embrace them, won&#39;t you."

Where before she had flinched at contact, now Emelle leans into your touch, almost welcoming it. She nods. "I will. It&#39;s the only way."

Emelle says, "It&#39;s Her way..."

You have emoted: Lin laughs gently. "Drown yourself in sensation. Take up the myrrh gum, the green absinthe, plunge your brain into turbulent waters. Be close to your Mother Goddess. I hope, when you have mastered your terror, you will be able to join me in Her garden."

Emelle leans up into a sitting position. Despite her bedraggled appearance, she has a resoluteness about her now. "I will." Grinning, she nods, and says again as if to herself, "I will."

You have emoted: Lin pats Emelle on the side of the head - too hard, like a captain snapping their soldier out of a daze. "Goddamned right you will. You&#39;re a good girl." She rises to her feet and glances down at Emelle, wearing a cheshire grin. "Good girl." She turns and prowls out of sight, her tail snaking after her.





You express your esteem of Emelle for: Wow, goddamn, BRAVO. Maybe I&#39;ve just been hanging out with too many disaffected types but Emelle&#39;s performance was intense. She marries this juxtaposition of confidence and fragility that most people falter on.

Emelle has expressed her esteem of you for the following reason: Wow. Thank you for that. I&#39;m just getting back into the game after a three year hiatus, and interacting with Lin was pure pleasure -- reminded me why I started doing this in the first place.


  [ Later. ]


You tell Emelle, "I sensed that you have no guild to call your own... how do you defend yourself, Emelle? How will you spill blood if She asks it of you?"

Emelle tells you, "That much I haven&#39;t figured out. I thought if I found Her first my path would become clearer."

You tell Emelle, "Of course you did. Proper thinking. Still, I have my concerns... pardon my saying so but you do not appear as ah... adept at killing with your bare hands as most."

Emelle tells you, "I&#39;m skilled enough with a dirk from my days with the Syssin, but I know it won&#39;t always be enough. I need to find a place that will be suitable for my unique...abilities."

You tell Emelle, "What abilities are those?"

Ingram tells you, "I&#39;m feeling possibly irrationally violent and I find myself but moments away from doing my best to kill folks."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Goodness."

Ingram tells you, "Starting wiiiiiith..."

Ingram tells you, "It&#39;s a toss-up between Kamus, Aryanne, and... Runk."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Do you need an outlet, then?"

Ingram tells you, "Or that."

Emelle tells you, "You know, the extrasensory ones. And one that doesn&#39;t need the use of traditional sight, obviously."

You tell Emelle, "Have you considered telepathy, my dear?"

You tell Emelle, "You would be shockingly good at it."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "As much as I would advocate you beating the living shit out of either Kamus or Runk, I&#39;m afraid they may outmatch you, some. I wouldn&#39;t mind a fistfight, though."

Emelle tells you, "No, I hadn&#39;t."

Ingram tells you, "A lot of people find themselves shocked into borderline paralysis when snared with a noose."

Emelle tells you, "Let&#39;s see...it&#39;s the Daru who practice that specific art, am I right?"

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Don&#39;t burn bridges with your guild, Ingram - you are trying to behave yourself, remember?"

Ingram tells you, "Guild?"

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Erm, aren&#39;t you a Sentaari these days?"

Ingram tells you, "No."

You tell Emelle, "Sure they do. They also tend their gardens, crochet, and the men wear dresses. There is something to be said for coating your fists with flames, but a Sentaari - a Sentaari is a being of iron! Strong in mind -and- body."

Ingram tells you, "And even were I.. It comes as a struggle for my imagination to encompass a realistic situation in which they would find it a deplorable act in which to murder Kamus in cold blood, seeing as how he conducts himself in a manner not unlike a mentally disabled individual."

Ingram tells you, "What with the overwheeeelming degree of stupidity."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Guh. He rather does, doesn&#39;t he. When he opens his mouth all I can think is how poorly my fist would fit into it."

Ingram tells you, "I want to skullfuck him into the land of the deceased."

Emelle tells you, "Ah. Yes. I forgot. A good thing, too. Don&#39;t think the Daru are for me."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Godshit, you -are- in a violent mood. The mood -I- am in, it would be utter joy to trade blows with you for a little while... Shuka? She is a Sentinel. Strange girl."

Ingram tells you, "You don&#39;t want to trade blows with me. You can&#39;t handle Horrace and Hermin."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "... Do I need to ask?"

Ingram tells you, "Right and left fist, respectively."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Ha, ha ha...! By the gods. I think I definitely need to 
see Horrace and Hermin."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Hermin? Really?"

Ingram tells you, "I&#39;m a righty, okay? Left hand gets a shit name."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "That is a name for poncey sailor boys who trawl port towns looking for fops to sleep with."

Ingram tells you, "This poncey sailor boy will knock you the living fuck out."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Tcha, if I felt it! You couldn&#39;t make a child wobble!"

Ingram tells you, "Only because I can&#39;t restrain myself to a simple wobble, but am subject to delivering knuckles of death?"

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Knuckles of pudgy human flesh, you mean! This woman, right here - these are knuckles. Knuckles made of iron. Knuckles that have split famous skulls. They have names too, they are Death and More Death!"

Ingram tells you, "In a conversation about duking it out, I stop listening after the word &#39;woman&#39;, &#39;female&#39;, &#39;lady&#39;, &#39;girl&#39;, so on."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "You are not scared of ladies, are you, Ingram? Perhaps you forget I am twice your weight. Come on!"

Ingram tells you, "Bigger they are..."

You tell Ingram Tenor, "Come here so I can knock your fat head in, wench! Ha ha!"

Ingram has entered the area.

Ingram sprints in from the northwest.

Morgun Forest on western bank of Urubamba. (Morgun Forest.) (695)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The mighty Urubamba river roars past you to the southeast, while to the northwest, the forest darkens as the trees and underbrush grow ever thicker. Ingram Tenor is here. He wields an iron-tipped whip in his left hand and a needle-pointed dirk in his right. Exits: northwest.

Ingram skids to a stop with an obnoxious sniff before wiping his nose with a fist. "All right, -titted one-, let&#39;s go."

You have emoted: Wearing a manic, vicious grin, Lin raises her fists to Ingram, hunched like a particularly feral pit fighter. Her claws are already covered in a worrying amount of blood. Her tail dancing playfully, she takes a lunging step in toward Ingram.

With a small smirk, Ingram remains where he is, standing heels-together. He gives a slow tilt of his head, one that sends a symphony of cracks from his spine before he murmurs, "Been having people bigger and older try to hurt me when I was but a youngin&#39;."

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s tongue slicks over the perilous points of her teeth. "That how you lose your ear, manling?" At closer proximity, the excitement she wears shows its true colors: nervousness, fear, and a deep well of adrenaline that practically seeps from her body. She still will not make the first move, watching Ingram&#39;s feet carefully.

At your question, Ingram&#39;s smirk fades, as does the majority of his levity. Instead, his face steels over and his head straightens up. He gives a short sigh through his nose, cracks the knuckles of his right hand, spaces his feet, raises his fists, and gives you a simple nod.

You have emoted: "Show me some of that murderousness!" Lin growls. Sensing Ingram&#39;s readiness, she surges forward, her feet plowing into the earth with such force that she leaves a scythe of dirt and grass in her wake. Her right fist extends in a hook, hoping to bash Ingram&#39;s shoulder in.

Barely audible and calm as a coma, Ingram murmurs, "This -is- me when I murder." He lowers and rolls his body, trying to either avoid or simply turn the blow into something glancing.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s fist shoots past Ingram&#39;s arm, terminating in what would have been a crushing palm strike. She adjusts to recoup her miss, a small hop to switch the positions of her feet, and her hands churn the air as she performs a preparatory flourish. She has taken up stance, that of the dragon, and dares Ingram to attack.

Having continued down, Ingram&#39;s hand rolls through the muddy, sandy bank to scoop up a handful of loose dirt, something he doesn&#39;t waste time flicking at your eyes before following quickly behind.

Ellenia has entered the area.

You sent the following message to Ingram:
(( Heads up, might have Ellenia on my ass in a second ))
Ingram would like you to know: Thank you.

Ellenia&#39;s aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
Ellenia&#39;s attack rebounds off your magical shield.

Targetting: Target set to Ellenia.
You begin to tunnel your vision on Ellenia.

[T]: Attempting a mind lock on Ellenia Cardinalis at 27900 (100%) willpower and 100% mana.
Your mindlock is speeded by the mindprint you hold.

You smirk.


  [ Much fighting! I am whisked away, where I slay Ellenia, and
    then with Ingram&#39;s help we continue to drive her off, though
    eventually she quits the Morgun. ]


Ellenia is out of range of your telepathy, and the mental cords between you snap 
instantly.

You tell Ellenia Cardinalis, "You are aware I no longer have any of the hunting ground items."

You tell Ellenia Cardinalis, "So I&#39;m not sure why you are here."

Ellenia tells you, "You have a bounty."

You tell Ellenia Cardinalis, "Ah, well then."

You sent the following message to Ingram:
Silly me, I have a bounty!
Ingram would like you to know: Thank you.


  --> --> -->


You sent the following message to Ingram:
Come back to the Heartwood, love. She will retaliate against you.
Ingram would like you to know: Thank you.

Ingram ripples into existence before you.

You have emoted: Lin snorts roughly into her mask. "She dared to attack me. -Me-."

Ingram sniffs faintly and lifts his hand to give his hair a short combing back.

You have emoted: Lin claps her hand on Ingram&#39;s shoulder, her manner blunt and rough, her temperament wild. "Goddamned good show, there. Not scared in the slightest, are you."

"Residuals of a mood," Ingram mutters, glancing off.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s chin bobs slightly, followed by the sound of teeth clashing together. "Goddamned whore-- listen, I am sorry for mentioning your ear. Trying to rile you up." She glances in Ingram&#39;s direction. "No hard feelings?"

Ingram shakes his head "No." in answer. His eyes still drift about, looking almost bored.

You have emoted: "No fistfight between us," Lin says, her voice laden with a thick growl. "Too... too tense. Must be... must be nice to you, Ingram, must be nice." Her shoulders rise and fall roughly, her tail bouncing, as it seems she is possessed by a case of bloodlust.

"How&#39;s that?" Ingram asks, voice coming slow and in a borderline drawl. He rolls his head to the side to peer up at you.

You have emoted: Lin glances sharply at Ingram, her ears tilting back. The slight angle of her head suggests a lack of understanding.

Ingram Tenor asks, "How is it nice to be me?"

You have emoted: "Did not say it was..." Lin trails off, and considers Ingram with a careful eye. "No... not nice yet. Your life has not yet stabilized. Can&#39;t be comfortable, can&#39;t rest." She resumes her grip on Ingram&#39;s shoulder, rubbing it firmly. "Wish I could bring you peace."

Ingram&#39;s chuckle that comes, dark and low, precedes his response. "Nobody can bring me peace except someone already dead."

You have emoted: Lin stares away, the lines in her neck drawn tight. "Who is it, Ingram? Is it someone I could bring back, even for a little while? Would you hate me if I tried?"

Ingram gives a pained sigh.

Ingram beckons you to him.

You begin to follow Ingram.

You follow Ingram to the north.
Paramour. (Ancient Heartwood.) (20186)
A conjured holdfast sigil lies here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.
Exits: northeast, east, and south.


You begin to wield a firefly sigil in your left hand.
You cast the firefly sigil at the ground, and it bursts with a flash of light.

You have emoted: "Being careful," Lin explains.

Ingram Tenor says, "I checked already."

Ingram strolls along the path before stopping at a particularly unremarkable point. He turns around and draws his dirk from his coat. "If you want to hear this story, and the one of how I lost my ear-- as they&#39;re the same-- it&#39;ll come at a cost."

You have emoted: Lin has not relaxed in the slightest, her breath coming rough through her teeth. It is like being in the presence of a starved lion, in manner as well as appearance. "Tell me," she says roughly.

Ingram&#39;s leg lifts up, bringing his knee hip-high for him to tap the broad side of his blade against it. He smiles and says, "Come here, turn around, and kneel down."

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s ears swivel down at a sharp angle. She does as directed, lowering herself to kneel in the blue grass before Ingram.

Stepping up behind you, Ingram lays a hand over your shoulder and gives it a small squeeze. Then, with a sympathizing sigh, leans forward to snake his arm under your jaw and around your throat. Finding his hold secure, his arm goes tight, jamming your head into a lock against his lower chest. "Now, most people have a general inclination towards not losing their minds. Few genuinely seek it.. But what I&#39;ve found is fewer seem to take many strides towards actively avoiding it, getting all caught up in some nonsense or another that&#39;s too much or far beyond extreme." He sniffs and lifts his dirk to rest the edge against your left ear. "I find myself to be of a different way. Now, take a stab at how I lost my ear. Give me a guess."

You have emoted: Lin releases a throaty gasp and in an instant, her hands close over Ingram&#39;s arm, her intention clearly to throw him off. The blade makes her change her mind; even in her violent demeanor she will not risk it. In a ragged, bestial voice, she replies, "It was cut OFF."

"That&#39;s right," Ingram mutters. He glances off and continues. "My ear is directly related to my aversion towards insanity. My aversion is a result of an almost crippling fear that I&#39;m going to turn out exactly like my dad." Leaning his face next to your opposite ear, he whispers, "Guess what my dad was." His blade is applied with a minute measure of increased pressure, threatening to break the surface tissue.

You have emoted: Lin&#39;s stomach goes tight, her claws digging into Ingram&#39;s arm. She tries to twist her head, and subsequently her ear, away from the dirk, her breath a rapid, diffused sound beneath her mask. "Insane, he was insane," she growls hurriedly, barely masking the apprehension in her voice.

Ingram presses his lips against the top of your head, his smile felt in the kiss. "Right again," he says. "It wasn&#39;t a result of any particular event, he was just unlucky. An inherent predisposition towards going mad. Some people just go crazy, and he was one of &#39;em." Angling his hand, his weapon now officially slices into your ear, but at this point, only creating a nick of a wound. "Anyways, one day he just went off about something or other, grabbed me at the youthful age of eight, and hacked my ear off. Now, you have to imagine this. Remember how adults looked when you&#39;re that young, especially ones with great authority. Giant, lumbering creatures whose footfalls shake the world. See him, like I said, flailing about in rage before stomping over to me, snatching me by the back of my neck, forcing me onto the ground and blocking out the light with his body. Imagine his spittle and hateful words splashing into my face as he screamed and cut off my ear. Imagine the only thing you&#39;re able to think, see, hear, and feel if your father rambling crazy as he fucking takes a knife to you for NO DISCERNIBLE FUCKING REASON!" While relatively paced up until this point with his dirk, Ingram takes this moment to simply swipe the blade with a good amount of force through your ear at the apex of his words.

You have emoted: Lin doesn&#39;t even seem to register what has happened for a heartbeat or two, not until the slender, severed chunk lands in the grass, the faintest rustle to announce its fall. Blood pumps freely from one of her ears now, which has been made several inches shorter. The silence holds for a solid second, maybe two, before she looses a bloodcurdling scream. The claws that poke into Ingram&#39;s arm sink their way home, and she surges to her feet, jerking on his arm and rolling her shoulder to toss him over it.

Ingram flies over your body with a heaving laugh that collapses his lungs. His back smacks the ground in what would&#39;ve winded him had he not already expelled the air. He grins up at you, sucks in another lungful, and says, "But wait, Lin, you haven&#39;t heard the point. The important part!" He flashes a grin, his hand curling around his forearm to try and stem the blood escaping.

You have emoted: Hunched over, Lin staggers forward two steps, rips off her mask, and reaches up to grab at her ear. The pain doesn&#39;t appear to bother her, eliciting only a minor wince, but there is some other horror that registers when she feels the sheared wound, something that morphs into fury in her stomach, drives all vestiges of humanity from her face. Her eyes are upon Ingram now, her claws spread and ready to kill.

Ingram continues on as if everything were complacent. "Only man who can give me peace is him, because he died shortly after that. All he left me with was a paralyzing fear that I&#39;m just.." He pauses to open his fist like an explosion. "Going to go off the rocker, and not be able to do a damn thing to stop it. All I want is more -time-, time to find out if I&#39;m different, or better, or if he was fixable."

Ingram Tenor says, "But-alas-he&#39;s-dead."

You have emoted: Lin looms over Ingram, her ear dripping into the grass beside his head. She snorts furiously through her nose, fangs bared, but whatever horrible retribution that must surely come next never happens. Control returns to her eyes, and with it, an expression of cruelty. She lifts and stomps on Ingram&#39;s chest.

This time, Ingram&#39;s lungs are forcibly purged, leaving the wind knocked out of him. He curls up with a choked, soundless expression of pain, face contorting. His hands come up to cross over his chest.

You have emoted: "Horrible thing... to do... to a child," Lin breathes, venting anger, it seems, with each breath. It is possible to watch the heaving of her chest lessen and lessen. It may be considerably more difficult to focus on this with an oversized cockatrice&#39;s foot pushing down Ingram&#39;s gut. "-My- father... took... an eye. You remember, surely. There was no... madness... only a misunderstanding..." Pain flashes across her face. "Of our relationship."

Ingram still in the process of trying to regain a breath to breathe, simply taps his dirk against his shoulder as he clenches his eyes shut, baring his teeth. He seems to be of a coherent mind simply fighting physical restrictions.

You have emoted: "This was it," Lin continues. The wind picks up, sears across the raw opening of her ear and makes her shudder. "Now... I get you. After all these years... no more apologies. No more being gentle. You will not run from your worst fear - you will embrace it and live it, fully." She swivels and steps aside, her foot turning a half-circle on Ingram&#39;s stomach, that massive foreclaw raised like an impending warning. Slowly, she drops herself to one knee, increasing her weight on Ingram&#39;s abdomen.

Eyes jamming open, Ingram turns his head and gazes up at you, shocked. He can&#39;t seem to fully process this for the longest time, mouth opening and closing as he tries to articulate something. Only when it closes does his mouth snap shut and a snarl cross his face. He twists his arm, bends his wrist, and jams his blade downwards from his chest to try and stab into your ankle.

You have emoted: The dirk sinks into the flesh with an oddly satisfying crunch, piercing not just human skin but some manner of tough cartilage. Lin makes a gulping sound, the lines around her eyes taut as she squints with pain. She watches the blade stick, drive home and stop at bone, and then seizes Ingram&#39;s throat just beneath the jaw. As she speaks, her voice runs ragged with the pain of the stab wound. "Done... accomodating you, Ingram... your father was a sick, fucking bastard... no- no moral to it. This? This I do out of LOVE! Luxury I had, you DIDN&#39;T!" Half of Ingram&#39;s vision goes black, Lin&#39;s hand covering the left side of his face. A single bladed nail enters the flesh at the corner of his eye, then rips across the soft ocular organ, splitting it from end to end.

Ingram&#39;s fingers bends and rise, the pain coursing from every end of his body to the other, the man unable to grip the handle of his weapon. His mouth opens, wide, almost dislocating his jaw, but nothing comes out. In part from shock, in part your grip, he simply spasms underneath you for moments as he tries to comprehend. Then, in spite of your hand, in spite of your foot on his solar plexus, he screams. The sounds comes savage, and almost inhuman, scraping up his throat like a battalion of spider to fill the room black with spindly, bent legs.

You have emoted: Lin finishes the stroke by slinging the globular blood from her fingertip, gazing in awe at her own handiwork as if she can scarcely believe it. She pulls herself off of Ingram, backing away enough to clear his flailing before she reaches down to gingerly pluck the blade from her ankle, tossing it carelessly aside. She limps on that foot, watching Ingram with wide eyes that dust up with sand.

Ingram&#39;s back arcs and juts his torso into the air as his elbows slam into the ground at either side. His arms bend and he kicks his heels, carving scars in the garden while his screams continue, pausing only for fuel with an inhale. Soon, when his energy is expended, he finds himself on his side, curled, hands covering his face and ragged breaths blowing against his palms. The adrenaline, the pain, everything leaves him wracked and shaking, twitching.

You have emoted: Lin remains immobile, watching the process through. Blood pumps lazily from her ear and foot, but her chin is lifted high, eyes on Ingram, only a hardened, resolute expression to bely the tears streaming down her cheeks. At last, she asks, "Where are you?"

When Ingram answers, his form has stilled. He speaks through his hands, in a muted whispers, to say, "In an unhappy place."

You have emoted: "Then you will surely seek something happy, something SIMPLE," Lin practically spits that last word, a fleck of blood leaving her lips. "You will live a soft life, as a soft person. This day will simply be another Nightmare, something to keep you from sleeping. A coward. A bastard." Pure contempt fills the lines of her face, an age that only shows in her more extreme emotions.

You have emoted: "WON&#39;T YOU?!" Lin shrieks.

Ingram&#39;s process of rolling onto his stomach, then rising to his hands and knees, and finally bringing himself to his feet is generally a long and gradual one. As he finalizes his ascension, he whips his head back and sniffs, staring ahead-- to your left. After a few more deep breaths, he turns and glances down at the destination of his fallen hat. His empty ocular cavity spasms, his eyelids twitching and snapping, causing a wave of movement through that side of his face as pain surges through it. Yet, he does an okay job of reeling in the hurt from his expression, the shock of losing half his vision. He takes a thumping, shaky step towards the hat, then another, and soon finds himself over it before bending down to snatch it up and mount it over his hair.

Another sniff, another wince, another full-body spasm, and another turn. Ingram faces you again before he says in a weak, hoarse voice, "I&#39;ll forgive you for this, eventually, but not this month. Probably not the next one, either. After that, it&#39;s up for grabs.

A quarter of Ingram&#39;s face is painted red, gloupy and dark blood pouring from his eyehole as he gazes at you with the remaining orb.

You have emoted: Lin claps her hand over her mouth, putting away her glare to sob jerkily into her palm. This lasts for only a moment. "And it won&#39;t even MEAN anything!" she shouts, her voice high-pitched and hoarse. "Not to you! You- you will only remember the violence, the pain, like- like an animal! Won&#39;t... won&#39;t mean anything at all..."

You have emoted: Her words finished, Lin spreads her hand over her face and weeps shudderingly into it again, as inhuman in this anguished wailing as she sounded whilst furious and looming over Ingram&#39;s prone body.

Ingram&#39;s hand rises to lay over the dark, bleeding hole of his face. He takes a few more shaky, jerky steps up to you and whispers, "Lin? I will tell you irrevocably that this... That -this- means something con-fucking-siderable to me. And you&#39;ll get to, first and foremost, experience what that meaning is in the very near future."

Ingram closes his remaining eye and sighs softly, his concentration and focus shifting back to his injury. He turns back around, takes a moment to check himself, and begins walking off with his hand still grasping his face.

You have emoted: Lin snaps her head up, her hand fallen away, a cooled and solemn look to her face. "I fucking love you, Ingram Tenor.

Words coming over his shoulder, Ingram almost laughingly asks, "I wonder if you&#39;ll be able to say that later."

You have emoted: Lin limps away, favoring her good foot.'>You have emoted: Lin comes in closer, a short span away from Emelle, her tail flickering from side to side. At this proximity she must angle her head down to keep her lock on Emelle's eyes, and in them there is definite interest, the way one looks forward to going to work. "Is it the claws?" she asks, unfurling a hand, putting the daggerlike things on display.
"No." Emelle's index finger twitches. That errant movement aside, she remains standing very still, her palm still facing you.
Emelle murmurs, "More."
You have emoted: "Teeth? Muscles?" Lin tugs back her lip to show off her fangs, her eyebrows rising in a whimsical fashion that borders on the sarcastic. Then she flexes one arm, a bicep that would put your typical male warrior to shame.
Emelle smiles knowingly. Though her milky gaze remains unfocused and blank, somehow she seems to understand your display. "No," she repeats.
Dropping her arms to her sides, you say, "In what way do you see power in me, Emelle? And do you think I see the same in you?"
A moth flutters in from the up.
Emelle drops her hand suddenly, her empty stare seeming to follow the moth as it flutters around. "I hear you," she singsongs.
Returning her attention to you, Emelle regards you momentarily. "It vibrates," she states simply. "But I don't know if you see it in me."
You have emoted: Lin taps Emelle on the head as if to check to see if it is hollow. It seems that her opinion of Emelle's mental capacity falters slightly, and she takes on a resigned frown, but something catches her attention, making her ears twitch. "I don't see it," she says quietly. "Why don't you explain it to me."
Flinching at your touch, Emelle inhales sharply. "Power?" she queries, apparently ignorant of her lack of clarity.
You have emoted: Lin paces away from Emelle, her hands clasping behind her back, tail meandering about out of sync with her gait. "I can clearly see you are a... gifted one. Go on. Explain power to me. What is power? Do you want power?"
Emelle leans forward onto the balls of her feet, then back onto her heels. "Power is energy," she responds. She speaks slowly, as though savoring the words. "It comes from knowledge. Strength. Emotion. Ability." Hesitating, she turns her head to the side, obscuring her empty gaze from you. "Power is the balance between control and chaos."
You have emoted: "Well," Lin says softly, "I suppose two out of four is not bad. Be honest with me, Emelle. What are you, really?" She turns on her heel to face Emelle once more, screwing up her face as she more or less gawks at her. "Madwoman? An old Spirean opium habit gone wrong? Perhaps you saw a grisly death and your mind snapped?"
Emelle smirks, her features darkening. "What am I?" she returns, her words laced with a hint of bitterness. "If only I knew. I am not sighted, but I see." She sighs. "I'm no more or less mad than the next person."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "A blind one, like Me. How well does she see, Speaker Mine?"
You have emoted: Lin frowns thoughtfully, then something snaps. She walks right up to Emelle, no more than an arm's length away, and waves her hand right in front of her face.
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "Ah, You read my thoughts, Mother. Let us see."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "I feel utterly embarrassed - it did not even occur to me she could not see. You... have a way of attracting very odd people."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "It is My way. She has been through My mind many a time. I saw her but never hunted her, never sent My things after her. She seemed at ease. There was no fear."
In a deft movement, Emelle reaches up and grips your wrist, wrapping her fingers tightly around it. She isn't strong by comparison, but her grasp is firm.
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "And I see why!"
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "Tcha! Feisty one."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "VERY good."
You have emoted: Lin grunts, flexing her fist in a way that makes her wrist pulse in Emelle's hand. Her mouth cracks into an utterly pleased smile. "Well, don't I feel foolish," she says, her voice gone sultry.
You have emoted: "State your intention for being here," Lin demands of Emelle, quite content to leave her hand in Emelle's grasp.
Emelle's grip slackens briefly as she appears to consider releasing you, but she then tightens it again. "I was exploring," she replies, her tone even. "I've been gone a long time. I met Ingram on the way. I remember his face."
You have emoted: "You remember-- you remember a soundshape, a vibration?" Lin asks speculatively. Her interest piqued, her tail slashes at the grass.
Emelle shakes her head. "I remember the shape of it. I felt it a long time ago, and I felt it again. When I touch, I imagine."
Emelle says, "There are many ways to see."
You have emoted: Lin nods soberly, understanding finally imprinted in her thick head. "That there are. That you are alive - and I sense you have lived long, despite your... lack of power - is a testament to your acuity. What can Mother Omei do for you?"
(Order): Levi says, "How is everyone?"
You feel the temperature around you to be about 52 F. The air is nearly completely still. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky.
(Order): You say, "Cold, but too excitable to care."
(Order): You say, "You? Still in that ceremony?"
(Order): Levi says, "Four and a half days was enough for me."
(Order): You say, "Godspit and shit."
(Order): Levi says, "Expecially when they were going in circles."
At this, Emelle releases you from her grasp and brushes her bangs out of her dull eyes. "I've been gone for a century or so, somewhere else. I don't know where, a realm of dreams? I got some clarity." She frowns. "I want to understand my Nightmares. I want to learn to use my emotions instead of straining against them. It makes me weak." Pausing, she inhales slowly, then exhales. "I can't be powerful without using everything that I have. I want Her to help me understand, and I want to give my sight to Her."
You have emoted: Lin smooths the fur along her wrist on her brow, and paces around Emelle, pausing behind her, putting herself between the tsol'aa woman and the lake. "She is here," she says quietly. "She hears you and She sees you in the black pits of Her eyes. Tell Her aloud what nightmares haunt you."
You say, "Tell her what keeps you up at night."
Emelle closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. "It doesn't keep me up. It keeps me down. Sometimes I can't escape it." Tilting her head upward, eyes still closed, she inhales again. "I am lost. I am not asleep, but not awake. Not comfortable, but not in pain. I wander in familiar dark for hours, days, years. No sense of time. Somehow I stumble, though I don't walk, and I fall almost endlessly, my being writhing and tearing at the core. I asphyxiate. Over and over again."
The recall is apparently difficult, and a shudder wracks Emelle's body. "Sometimes I see colors, and they blind me. Other times I can read, all the symbols of the world, and I can feel them. All the world's knowledge makes my head explode."
With wonder, Emelle adds, "I always die..." and falls silent.
(The Benandanti Consulate): Soramizu says, "Today even more than other days, I feel tremendously lucky to be a Duiranite."
(The Benandanti Consulate): You say, "Why is that?"
(The Benandanti Consulate): Soramizu says, "The Enorianites are quarreling. I need not mull over a solution to their troubles, and even I have a headache."
You have emoted: A pair of hands curl over Emelle's shoulders. The claws are razor sharp, but merely rest with an uncomfortable prickle. Lin leans in close, her hair bristling against Emelle's cheek. She speaks in a hush, her voice kept private for her.
You murmur to Emelle, "Are you afraid to die, tsol'aa girl...?"
You project the hallucination into the mind of Emelle.
The claws bite into your flesh, the mere threat of pain, having easily breached your shirt.
Emelle winces, but does not cry out, instead taking a deep breath to steady herself. She softly replies, "No. Not after a thousand different times, a thousand different ways."
You murmur to Emelle, "Are you afraid of senselessness? Are you afraid of things getting... mixed up? Overwhelming you?"
You project the hallucination into the mind of Emelle.
Now they pierce the skin, but not enough to draw blood. It is a slow, clinical thing, like an injection in ten points.
Moaning softly, Emelle's voice catches in her throat. "Sometimes--" she chokes out.
You have emoted: Lin emits a pleasurable, low-voiced groan, like working through a good stretch. Her eyes flicker shut, and she whispers to Emelle at length.
You murmur to Emelle, "Sometimes... sometimes it drowns you, too much for one person's brain to process. You can hear the heartbeat of every person around you for miles. You see demons in people's eyes. There is always a noise, a crunch, a crush, pulsing through your skull. You black out, you close your eyes and someone else opens them. You forget which way is up."
You project the hallucination into the mind of Emelle.
Her palms tighten and her fingers shift, but there is no further pain, only the hint of it. Her pulse can be felt in her wrists as they rest on your shoulders.
Emelle bows her head in a silent gesture of acknowledgement.
You have emoted: The claws withdraw with a strange sliding feel. Lin embraces Emelle from behind, enveloping her in her crossed. "You poor thing, I am so sorry. Would you like the sensations to stop?"
Emelle's body twitches as your claws slide out of her. She allows the embrace, but her body remains taut. "They never stop."
You have emoted: "Then there is only one direction you can go," Lin murmurs. Her hands have not moved, but one turns up, revealing a ball of myrrh gum. It is held up for Emelle to take. Lin snaps her teeth together audibly, the clearest instruction she can give for what to do with the thing.
You project the hallucination into the mind of Emelle.
It smells unnatural, as if the thing had been stowed away in the incense bins of many generations of Djeirani merchants. But something else is afoot - a pressure in your head, static electricity.
Sensing the movement, Emelle places one of her hands over yours. Her fingers curl around the ball, and she grasps it between her thumb and fingers, rolling it back and forth momentarily.
Emelle lifts the ball to her face, presses it to her lips, and inhales its scent. Then, she pushes the object into her mouth.
Emelle eats a ball of myrrh gum.
You have emoted: "Things are going to get a little heavy," Lin says softly, her grip on Emelle tightening. Her heart pounds in tactile rhythm against her back. "I hope you can swim."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "I am there. INSIDE Her. Hold her for Me. I do not intend to show her mercy. Mercy is something My toys EARN."
Emelle suddenly writhes in your grasp. Though she struggles, she does not appear to be attempting to break away.
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "Drown her, Mother. Sink her so deep that she must swim to the surface, or die."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "Yes. You don't DARE let go of her."
You have emoted: Lin's claws sink into Emelle's arms without mercy, wine stains of blood blooming beneath her shirt. She whispers continually, never in the same tongue - incantations, oaths, heady promises of lust or violence that would make anyone's toes curl, if only they could be understood.
You murmur to Emelle in Harpy, "Burn you, little girl... spread your ribcage apart and curl up in your chest..."
Her body convulsing, Emelle gasps for air. Her muscles tense at the pain of your sharp claws, but she makes nary a sound aside from the occasional desperate gasp for oxygen.
Omei manifests, Her claws wound fiendishly around Emelle's throat, Her laughter bubbling up like the harsh crash of waves against a beach of stones; She is strangling her, Her very fingers like ice, visions of drowning and water and darkness pouring out over her as droplets of Her Divine blood dot and stain and taint her hair.
Omei murmurs something softly to Emelle.
You have emoted: Lin's voice rumbles deep - she is a primal beast, a saber cat, clutching Emelle to her breast. Her sepulchral growl trails off into a breathy laugh of delight. "Keep swimming, phantom... and pray there is air above the water."
Emelle whimpers quietly before a change overcomes her features. Her body slackens as she surrenders herself to Omei's grasp.
Struggling to speak, Emelle swallows hard, then manages to say simply: "Yes."
Omei murmurs something softly to Emelle.
Her voice a guttural growl, not too far distant from the roar of a thunderstorm, Omei, the Unfettered Nightmare says to Emelle, in Tsol'aa, "TELL. ME. MY. NAME."
You have emoted: Though she cannot understand most of the exchange being made, Lin flashes a fierce smile, her eyes widening as she thrills at the sound of Omei's voice, a gasp escaping her lips.
The muscles of her body tightening, Emelle's head lolls back as she tenses. "Omei!" she yells, her voice caught somewhere between pain and pleasure.
In silence, a smile gracing Her ugly, bloodstained features, Omei loosens Her fingers, and allows Emelle to breathe. Her own breathing is ragged, as though She has been running, hunting, rather than the simple act of asphyxiation, and She runs Her fingers over her hair, threading the strands through Her claws.
&lt;&lt;Order>>: You say, "Should I... should I let her go? Gods..."
&lt;&lt;Order>>: Omei says, "Hold her until she is done."
Emelle gasps terribly, readily gulping in the air. Her eyelids fly open to reveal her faded eyes again, and they almost appear somehow wild. She wheezes with the effort of breathing.
Emelle coughs softly.
You have emoted: Lin holds tight, drawing blood freely from Emelle's arms, keeping her from moving overmuch. She looks as if she has seen a ghost, the fur on her arms and cheeks standing on end. She shushes Emelle gently, whispering, "Good girl..."
"Good girl," Omei murmurs, Her voice soft, low, almost husky with some indefinite emotion. She creeps close, gazing at both you and Emelle, leaning down as She continues to bestow Her strange affection on her. "That's a GOOD girl."
Emelle turns her face toward Omei and bows her head, though whether in reverence or exhaustion it is difficult to tell.
You have emoted: Lin finds her cheeks turning red, a heavy, fearful tremble in her arms as her breath draws short.
A look of bewilderment suddenly etching itself on her face, Emelle regarding Omei with wonder, with her unseeing eyes.
Her voice filled with childlike wonder, with a warm, possessive affection, Omei, the Unfettered Nightmare asks Emelle, "And though you see not, you see more than others. Will you be My new Seer, someday? Will you do that, for Me? Become strong? Fight for your air just as you should, little phantom?"
You have emoted: Lin gasps again. If Emelle could but see, she would know the gallimaufry of emotions in Lin's face to be that wonder, awe, jealousy. Her claws slide from Emelle's arms with an audible slurp, and though she continues to hold her tight, it is the embrace of a sister, not a captor.
Emelle smiles almost wildly, nodding affirmatively. "I want to use my sight. I will use it for You, and learn to become strong from You."
Emelle leans back against you, her body finally relaxing in your embrace.
Omei murmurs something softly to Emelle.
Omei raises Her head, turning Her sightless gaze to you; a small smile is on Her lips, a strange expression of contentment there on Her face. Out She reaches, touching Her hand to your cheek, exhaling slowly, Her breath like a snake's rattle.
You have emoted: Lin's voice comes out in a creak, her mouth ajar, a shiver of fear coursing through her body. She stares into Omei's pitted face with adoration, gulping so hard it makes her throat pulse.
Her voice a benediction, a lover's murmur, Omei, the Unfettered Nightmare says to you, "GOOD girl."
Moths peeling away from Her one by one, Omei dissolves, She and the moths vanishing into thin air in a burst of riotous purple.
Emelle is lying on the ground flat on her back, limbs askew, blood spattered over her. Her chest rises and falls heavily with the effort of breathing.
You have emoted: Lin curls her arms around her body for a moment, her eyes somewhere else entirely. She shivers again in a fashion that would draw lewd attention, with a breathy sound that would suggest indecent activity. The spell is gone as suddenly as it game, and she watches Emelle with a fascinated look to her, reaching out to press two fingers over her heart.
At your touch, Emelle lifts her head off the ground with some effort. Much of her hair has escaped its binding, and it falls thickly over her shoulders. She gazes emptily at you, but her expression appears different somehow.
You have emoted: Lin stares deeply into Emelle's eyes. Liberated by the sightlessness of her accomplice, her expressions are unguarded, and she wears a look of raw curiosity. Despite this, she keeps her voice level, though it comes out quivery. "Is this where you need to be, Emelle?"
Emelle smiles, but with more meaning than she had previously. "Yes," she replies, reveling in the feeling of the word on her tongue. Her expression betrays awe and wonder.
You have emoted: "Drowning... I cannot imagine what that must have felt like. We all have our horrors, little Emelle - I cannot stand expressionlessness. Ingram is afraid of unpredictability." Lin tugs aside a lock of Emelle's hair and tosses it casually over her shoulder. "But you know now not to run from your Nightmares... you will embrace them, won't you."
Where before she had flinched at contact, now Emelle leans into your touch, almost welcoming it. She nods. "I will. It's the only way."
Emelle says, "It's Her way..."
You have emoted: Lin laughs gently. "Drown yourself in sensation. Take up the myrrh gum, the green absinthe, plunge your brain into turbulent waters. Be close to your Mother Goddess. I hope, when you have mastered your terror, you will be able to join me in Her garden."
Emelle leans up into a sitting position. Despite her bedraggled appearance, she has a resoluteness about her now. "I will." Grinning, she nods, and says again as if to herself, "I will."
You have emoted: Lin pats Emelle on the side of the head - too hard, like a captain snapping their soldier out of a daze. "Goddamned right you will. You're a good girl." She rises to her feet and glances down at Emelle, wearing a cheshire grin. "Good girl." She turns and prowls out of sight, her tail snaking after her.
You express your esteem of Emelle for: Wow, goddamn, BRAVO. Maybe I've just been hanging out with too many disaffected types but Emelle's performance was intense. She marries this juxtaposition of confidence and fragility that most people falter on.
Emelle has expressed her esteem of you for the following reason: Wow. Thank you for that. I'm just getting back into the game after a three year hiatus, and interacting with Lin was pure pleasure -- reminded me why I started doing this in the first place.
[ Later. ]
You tell Emelle, "I sensed that you have no guild to call your own... how do you defend yourself, Emelle? How will you spill blood if She asks it of you?"
Emelle tells you, "That much I haven't figured out. I thought if I found Her first my path would become clearer."
You tell Emelle, "Of course you did. Proper thinking. Still, I have my concerns... pardon my saying so but you do not appear as ah... adept at killing with your bare hands as most."
Emelle tells you, "I'm skilled enough with a dirk from my days with the Syssin, but I know it won't always be enough. I need to find a place that will be suitable for my unique...abilities."
You tell Emelle, "What abilities are those?"
Ingram tells you, "I'm feeling possibly irrationally violent and I find myself but moments away from doing my best to kill folks."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Goodness."
Ingram tells you, "Starting wiiiiiith..."
Ingram tells you, "It's a toss-up between Kamus, Aryanne, and... Runk."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Do you need an outlet, then?"
Ingram tells you, "Or that."
Emelle tells you, "You know, the extrasensory ones. And one that doesn't need the use of traditional sight, obviously."
You tell Emelle, "Have you considered telepathy, my dear?"
You tell Emelle, "You would be shockingly good at it."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "As much as I would advocate you beating the living shit out of either Kamus or Runk, I'm afraid they may outmatch you, some. I wouldn't mind a fistfight, though."
Emelle tells you, "No, I hadn't."
Ingram tells you, "A lot of people find themselves shocked into borderline paralysis when snared with a noose."
Emelle tells you, "Let's see...it's the Daru who practice that specific art, am I right?"
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Don't burn bridges with your guild, Ingram - you are trying to behave yourself, remember?"
Ingram tells you, "Guild?"
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Erm, aren't you a Sentaari these days?"
Ingram tells you, "No."
You tell Emelle, "Sure they do. They also tend their gardens, crochet, and the men wear dresses. There is something to be said for coating your fists with flames, but a Sentaari - a Sentaari is a being of iron! Strong in mind -and- body."
Ingram tells you, "And even were I.. It comes as a struggle for my imagination to encompass a realistic situation in which they would find it a deplorable act in which to murder Kamus in cold blood, seeing as how he conducts himself in a manner not unlike a mentally disabled individual."
Ingram tells you, "What with the overwheeeelming degree of stupidity."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Guh. He rather does, doesn't he. When he opens his mouth all I can think is how poorly my fist would fit into it."
Ingram tells you, "I want to skullfuck him into the land of the deceased."
Emelle tells you, "Ah. Yes. I forgot. A good thing, too. Don't think the Daru are for me."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Godshit, you -are- in a violent mood. The mood -I- am in, it would be utter joy to trade blows with you for a little while... Shuka? She is a Sentinel. Strange girl."
Ingram tells you, "You don't want to trade blows with me. You can't handle Horrace and Hermin."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "... Do I need to ask?"
Ingram tells you, "Right and left fist, respectively."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Ha, ha ha...! By the gods. I think I definitely need to
see Horrace and Hermin."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Hermin? Really?"
Ingram tells you, "I'm a righty, okay? Left hand gets a shit name."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "That is a name for poncey sailor boys who trawl port towns looking for fops to sleep with."
Ingram tells you, "This poncey sailor boy will knock you the living fuck out."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Tcha, if I felt it! You couldn't make a child wobble!"
Ingram tells you, "Only because I can't restrain myself to a simple wobble, but am subject to delivering knuckles of death?"
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Knuckles of pudgy human flesh, you mean! This woman, right here - these are knuckles. Knuckles made of iron. Knuckles that have split famous skulls. They have names too, they are Death and More Death!"
Ingram tells you, "In a conversation about duking it out, I stop listening after the word 'woman', 'female', 'lady', 'girl', so on."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "You are not scared of ladies, are you, Ingram? Perhaps you forget I am twice your weight. Come on!"
Ingram tells you, "Bigger they are..."
You tell Ingram Tenor, "Come here so I can knock your fat head in, wench! Ha ha!"
Ingram has entered the area.
Ingram sprints in from the northwest.
Morgun Forest on western bank of Urubamba. (Morgun Forest.) (695)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The mighty Urubamba river roars past you to the southeast, while to the northwest, the forest darkens as the trees and underbrush grow ever thicker. Ingram Tenor is here. He wields an iron-tipped whip in his left hand and a needle-pointed dirk in his right. Exits: northwest.
Ingram skids to a stop with an obnoxious sniff before wiping his nose with a fist. "All right, -titted one-, let's go."
You have emoted: Wearing a manic, vicious grin, Lin raises her fists to Ingram, hunched like a particularly feral pit fighter. Her claws are already covered in a worrying amount of blood. Her tail dancing playfully, she takes a lunging step in toward Ingram.
With a small smirk, Ingram remains where he is, standing heels-together. He gives a slow tilt of his head, one that sends a symphony of cracks from his spine before he murmurs, "Been having people bigger and older try to hurt me when I was but a youngin'."
You have emoted: Lin's tongue slicks over the perilous points of her teeth. "That how you lose your ear, manling?" At closer proximity, the excitement she wears shows its true colors: nervousness, fear, and a deep well of adrenaline that practically seeps from her body. She still will not make the first move, watching Ingram's feet carefully.
At your question, Ingram's smirk fades, as does the majority of his levity. Instead, his face steels over and his head straightens up. He gives a short sigh through his nose, cracks the knuckles of his right hand, spaces his feet, raises his fists, and gives you a simple nod.
You have emoted: "Show me some of that murderousness!" Lin growls. Sensing Ingram's readiness, she surges forward, her feet plowing into the earth with such force that she leaves a scythe of dirt and grass in her wake. Her right fist extends in a hook, hoping to bash Ingram's shoulder in.
Barely audible and calm as a coma, Ingram murmurs, "This -is- me when I murder." He lowers and rolls his body, trying to either avoid or simply turn the blow into something glancing.
You have emoted: Lin's fist shoots past Ingram's arm, terminating in what would have been a crushing palm strike. She adjusts to recoup her miss, a small hop to switch the positions of her feet, and her hands churn the air as she performs a preparatory flourish. She has taken up stance, that of the dragon, and dares Ingram to attack.
Having continued down, Ingram's hand rolls through the muddy, sandy bank to scoop up a handful of loose dirt, something he doesn't waste time flicking at your eyes before following quickly behind.
Ellenia has entered the area.
You sent the following message to Ingram:
(( Heads up, might have Ellenia on my ass in a second ))
Ingram would like you to know: Thank you.
Ellenia's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
Ellenia's attack rebounds off your magical shield.
Targetting: Target set to Ellenia.
You begin to tunnel your vision on Ellenia.
[T]: Attempting a mind lock on Ellenia Cardinalis at 27900 (100%) willpower and 100% mana.
Your mindlock is speeded by the mindprint you hold.
You smirk.
[ Much fighting! I am whisked away, where I slay Ellenia, and
then with Ingram's help we continue to drive her off, though
eventually she quits the Morgun. ]
Ellenia is out of range of your telepathy, and the mental cords between you snap
instantly.
You tell Ellenia Cardinalis, "You are aware I no longer have any of the hunting ground items."
You tell Ellenia Cardinalis, "So I'm not sure why you are here."
Ellenia tells you, "You have a bounty."
You tell Ellenia Cardinalis, "Ah, well then."
You sent the following message to Ingram:
Silly me, I have a bounty!
Ingram would like you to know: Thank you.
--> --> -->
You sent the following message to Ingram:
Come back to the Heartwood, love. She will retaliate against you.
Ingram would like you to know: Thank you.
Ingram ripples into existence before you.
You have emoted: Lin snorts roughly into her mask. "She dared to attack me. -Me-."
Ingram sniffs faintly and lifts his hand to give his hair a short combing back.
You have emoted: Lin claps her hand on Ingram's shoulder, her manner blunt and rough, her temperament wild. "Goddamned good show, there. Not scared in the slightest, are you."
"Residuals of a mood," Ingram mutters, glancing off.
You have emoted: Lin's chin bobs slightly, followed by the sound of teeth clashing together. "Goddamned whore-- listen, I am sorry for mentioning your ear. Trying to rile you up." She glances in Ingram's direction. "No hard feelings?"
Ingram shakes his head "No." in answer. His eyes still drift about, looking almost bored.
You have emoted: "No fistfight between us," Lin says, her voice laden with a thick growl. "Too... too tense. Must be... must be nice to you, Ingram, must be nice." Her shoulders rise and fall roughly, her tail bouncing, as it seems she is possessed by a case of bloodlust.
"How's that?" Ingram asks, voice coming slow and in a borderline drawl. He rolls his head to the side to peer up at you.
You have emoted: Lin glances sharply at Ingram, her ears tilting back. The slight angle of her head suggests a lack of understanding.
Ingram Tenor asks, "How is it nice to be me?"
You have emoted: "Did not say it was..." Lin trails off, and considers Ingram with a careful eye. "No... not nice yet. Your life has not yet stabilized. Can't be comfortable, can't rest." She resumes her grip on Ingram's shoulder, rubbing it firmly. "Wish I could bring you peace."
Ingram's chuckle that comes, dark and low, precedes his response. "Nobody can bring me peace except someone already dead."
You have emoted: Lin stares away, the lines in her neck drawn tight. "Who is it, Ingram? Is it someone I could bring back, even for a little while? Would you hate me if I tried?"
Ingram gives a pained sigh.
Ingram beckons you to him.
You begin to follow Ingram.
--> --> -->
You follow Ingram to the north.
Paramour. (Ancient Heartwood.) (20186)
A conjured holdfast sigil lies here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.
Exits: northeast, east, and south.
You begin to wield a firefly sigil in your left hand.
You cast the firefly sigil at the ground, and it bursts with a flash of light.
You have emoted: "Being careful," Lin explains.
Ingram Tenor says, "I checked already."
Ingram strolls along the path before stopping at a particularly unremarkable point. He turns around and draws his dirk from his coat. "If you want to hear this story, and the one of how I lost my ear-- as they're the same-- it'll come at a cost."
You have emoted: Lin has not relaxed in the slightest, her breath coming rough through her teeth. It is like being in the presence of a starved lion, in manner as well as appearance. "Tell me," she says roughly.
Ingram's leg lifts up, bringing his knee hip-high for him to tap the broad side of his blade against it. He smiles and says, "Come here, turn around, and kneel down."
You have emoted: Lin's ears swivel down at a sharp angle. She does as directed, lowering herself to kneel in the blue grass before Ingram.
Stepping up behind you, Ingram lays a hand over your shoulder and gives it a small squeeze. Then, with a sympathizing sigh, leans forward to snake his arm under your jaw and around your throat. Finding his hold secure, his arm goes tight, jamming your head into a lock against his lower chest. "Now, most people have a general inclination towards not losing their minds. Few genuinely seek it.. But what I've found is fewer seem to take many strides towards actively avoiding it, getting all caught up in some nonsense or another that's too much or far beyond extreme." He sniffs and lifts his dirk to rest the edge against your left ear. "I find myself to be of a different way. Now, take a stab at how I lost my ear. Give me a guess."
You have emoted: Lin releases a throaty gasp and in an instant, her hands close over Ingram's arm, her intention clearly to throw him off. The blade makes her change her mind; even in her violent demeanor she will not risk it. In a ragged, bestial voice, she replies, "It was cut OFF."
"That's right," Ingram mutters. He glances off and continues. "My ear is directly related to my aversion towards insanity. My aversion is a result of an almost crippling fear that I'm going to turn out exactly like my dad." Leaning his face next to your opposite ear, he whispers, "Guess what my dad was." His blade is applied with a minute measure of increased pressure, threatening to break the surface tissue.
You have emoted: Lin's stomach goes tight, her claws digging into Ingram's arm. She tries to twist her head, and subsequently her ear, away from the dirk, her breath a rapid, diffused sound beneath her mask. "Insane, he was insane," she growls hurriedly, barely masking the apprehension in her voice.
Ingram presses his lips against the top of your head, his smile felt in the kiss. "Right again," he says. "It wasn't a result of any particular event, he was just unlucky. An inherent predisposition towards going mad. Some people just go crazy, and he was one of 'em." Angling his hand, his weapon now officially slices into your ear, but at this point, only creating a nick of a wound. "Anyways, one day he just went off about something or other, grabbed me at the youthful age of eight, and hacked my ear off. Now, you have to imagine this. Remember how adults looked when you're that young, especially ones with great authority. Giant, lumbering creatures whose footfalls shake the world. See him, like I said, flailing about in rage before stomping over to me, snatching me by the back of my neck, forcing me onto the ground and blocking out the light with his body. Imagine his spittle and hateful words splashing into my face as he screamed and cut off my ear. Imagine the only thing you're able to think, see, hear, and feel if your father rambling crazy as he fucking takes a knife to you for NO DISCERNIBLE FUCKING REASON!" While relatively paced up until this point with his dirk, Ingram takes this moment to simply swipe the blade with a good amount of force through your ear at the apex of his words.
You have emoted: Lin doesn't even seem to register what has happened for a heartbeat or two, not until the slender, severed chunk lands in the grass, the faintest rustle to announce its fall. Blood pumps freely from one of her ears now, which has been made several inches shorter. The silence holds for a solid second, maybe two, before she looses a bloodcurdling scream. The claws that poke into Ingram's arm sink their way home, and she surges to her feet, jerking on his arm and rolling her shoulder to toss him over it.
Ingram flies over your body with a heaving laugh that collapses his lungs. His back smacks the ground in what would've winded him had he not already expelled the air. He grins up at you, sucks in another lungful, and says, "But wait, Lin, you haven't heard the point. The important part!" He flashes a grin, his hand curling around his forearm to try and stem the blood escaping.
You have emoted: Hunched over, Lin staggers forward two steps, rips off her mask, and reaches up to grab at her ear. The pain doesn't appear to bother her, eliciting only a minor wince, but there is some other horror that registers when she feels the sheared wound, something that morphs into fury in her stomach, drives all vestiges of humanity from her face. Her eyes are upon Ingram now, her claws spread and ready to kill.
Ingram continues on as if everything were complacent. "Only man who can give me peace is him, because he died shortly after that. All he left me with was a paralyzing fear that I'm just.." He pauses to open his fist like an explosion. "Going to go off the rocker, and not be able to do a damn thing to stop it. All I want is more -time-, time to find out if I'm different, or better, or if he was fixable."
Ingram Tenor says, "But-alas-he's-dead."
You have emoted: Lin looms over Ingram, her ear dripping into the grass beside his head. She snorts furiously through her nose, fangs bared, but whatever horrible retribution that must surely come next never happens. Control returns to her eyes, and with it, an expression of cruelty. She lifts and stomps on Ingram's chest.
This time, Ingram's lungs are forcibly purged, leaving the wind knocked out of him. He curls up with a choked, soundless expression of pain, face contorting. His hands come up to cross over his chest.
You have emoted: "Horrible thing... to do... to a child," Lin breathes, venting anger, it seems, with each breath. It is possible to watch the heaving of her chest lessen and lessen. It may be considerably more difficult to focus on this with an oversized cockatrice's foot pushing down Ingram's gut. "-My- father... took... an eye. You remember, surely. There was no... madness... only a misunderstanding..." Pain flashes across her face. "Of our relationship."
Ingram still in the process of trying to regain a breath to breathe, simply taps his dirk against his shoulder as he clenches his eyes shut, baring his teeth. He seems to be of a coherent mind simply fighting physical restrictions.
You have emoted: "This was it," Lin continues. The wind picks up, sears across the raw opening of her ear and makes her shudder. "Now... I get you. After all these years... no more apologies. No more being gentle. You will not run from your worst fear - you will embrace it and live it, fully." She swivels and steps aside, her foot turning a half-circle on Ingram's stomach, that massive foreclaw raised like an impending warning. Slowly, she drops herself to one knee, increasing her weight on Ingram's abdomen.
Eyes jamming open, Ingram turns his head and gazes up at you, shocked. He can't seem to fully process this for the longest time, mouth opening and closing as he tries to articulate something. Only when it closes does his mouth snap shut and a snarl cross his face. He twists his arm, bends his wrist, and jams his blade downwards from his chest to try and stab into your ankle.
You have emoted: The dirk sinks into the flesh with an oddly satisfying crunch, piercing not just human skin but some manner of tough cartilage. Lin makes a gulping sound, the lines around her eyes taut as she squints with pain. She watches the blade stick, drive home and stop at bone, and then seizes Ingram's throat just beneath the jaw. As she speaks, her voice runs ragged with the pain of the stab wound. "Done... accomodating you, Ingram... your father was a sick, fucking bastard... no- no moral to it. This? This I do out of LOVE! Luxury I had, you DIDN'T!" Half of Ingram's vision goes black, Lin's hand covering the left side of his face. A single bladed nail enters the flesh at the corner of his eye, then rips across the soft ocular organ, splitting it from end to end.
Ingram's fingers bends and rise, the pain coursing from every end of his body to the other, the man unable to grip the handle of his weapon. His mouth opens, wide, almost dislocating his jaw, but nothing comes out. In part from shock, in part your grip, he simply spasms underneath you for moments as he tries to comprehend. Then, in spite of your hand, in spite of your foot on his solar plexus, he screams. The sounds comes savage, and almost inhuman, scraping up his throat like a battalion of spider to fill the room black with spindly, bent legs.
You have emoted: Lin finishes the stroke by slinging the globular blood from her fingertip, gazing in awe at her own handiwork as if she can scarcely believe it. She pulls herself off of Ingram, backing away enough to clear his flailing before she reaches down to gingerly pluck the blade from her ankle, tossing it carelessly aside. She limps on that foot, watching Ingram with wide eyes that dust up with sand.
Ingram's back arcs and juts his torso into the air as his elbows slam into the ground at either side. His arms bend and he kicks his heels, carving scars in the garden while his screams continue, pausing only for fuel with an inhale. Soon, when his energy is expended, he finds himself on his side, curled, hands covering his face and ragged breaths blowing against his palms. The adrenaline, the pain, everything leaves him wracked and shaking, twitching.
You have emoted: Lin remains immobile, watching the process through. Blood pumps lazily from her ear and foot, but her chin is lifted high, eyes on Ingram, only a hardened, resolute expression to bely the tears streaming down her cheeks. At last, she asks, "Where are you?"
When Ingram answers, his form has stilled. He speaks through his hands, in a muted whispers, to say, "In an unhappy place."
You have emoted: "Then you will surely seek something happy, something SIMPLE," Lin practically spits that last word, a fleck of blood leaving her lips. "You will live a soft life, as a soft person. This day will simply be another Nightmare, something to keep you from sleeping. A coward. A bastard." Pure contempt fills the lines of her face, an age that only shows in her more extreme emotions.
You have emoted: "WON'T YOU?!" Lin shrieks.
Ingram's process of rolling onto his stomach, then rising to his hands and knees, and finally bringing himself to his feet is generally a long and gradual one. As he finalizes his ascension, he whips his head back and sniffs, staring ahead-- to your left. After a few more deep breaths, he turns and glances down at the destination of his fallen hat. His empty ocular cavity spasms, his eyelids twitching and snapping, causing a wave of movement through that side of his face as pain surges through it. Yet, he does an okay job of reeling in the hurt from his expression, the shock of losing half his vision. He takes a thumping, shaky step towards the hat, then another, and soon finds himself over it before bending down to snatch it up and mount it over his hair.
Another sniff, another wince, another full-body spasm, and another turn. Ingram faces you again before he says in a weak, hoarse voice, "I'll forgive you for this, eventually, but not this month. Probably not the next one, either. After that, it's up for grabs.
A quarter of Ingram's face is painted red, gloupy and dark blood pouring from his eyehole as he gazes at you with the remaining orb.
You have emoted: Lin claps her hand over her mouth, putting away her glare to sob jerkily into her palm. This lasts for only a moment. "And it won't even MEAN anything!" she shouts, her voice high-pitched and hoarse. "Not to you! You- you will only remember the violence, the pain, like- like an animal! Won't... won't mean anything at all..."
You have emoted: Her words finished, Lin spreads her hand over her face and weeps shudderingly into it again, as inhuman in this anguished wailing as she sounded whilst furious and looming over Ingram's prone body.
Ingram's hand rises to lay over the dark, bleeding hole of his face. He takes a few more shaky, jerky steps up to you and whispers, "Lin? I will tell you irrevocably that this... That -this- means something con-fucking-siderable to me. And you'll get to, first and foremost, experience what that meaning is in the very near future."
Ingram closes his remaining eye and sighs softly, his concentration and focus shifting back to his injury. He turns back around, takes a moment to check himself, and begins walking off with his hand still grasping his face.
