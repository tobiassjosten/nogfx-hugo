Sharp curve in a rocky cavern.
A noble falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding you watchfully. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the 
north. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A grumpy badger stands here, 
snuffling about angrily. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the 
eye. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Nervously pacing, a small 
brown lemming scampers under your feet. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Fluttering on 
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room.
You see exits leading north and west.
