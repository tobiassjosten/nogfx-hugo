Bottom of a quarry pit. (Tir Murann)
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. The 
construction of numerous stone structures begin here, evidenced by the presence 
of large solid granite blocks, ranging in age and shape from rough, uncut slabs 
to smooth, finished blocks awaiting use. One such finished slab sits on an 
overworked cart affixed to a long, thick rope that stretches up the gravel 
incline and leads out of the quarry. A long stone has been pushed against the 
southern wall, providing a place where a tired worker can rest in the shade for 
a break from work and relief the burning heat of the sun during a hot day. A 
bayberry tree grows here. Covered with spines, a hawthorn bush is growing. 
Several picks line a wooden rack set into the quarry's wall. Ohmut is here, 
sitting in the shade as she takes a short break. A towering Vertani guard stands
at attention, casting a watchful eye around him.
You see a single exit leading west.

A steep gravel incline. (Tir Murann)
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. A 
bayberry tree grows here. Covered with spines, a hawthorn bush is growing. A 
huge shrine dominates the location and bathes it in intense light and rhythmic 
patterns of sound.

Traversing over debris (road).
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. The 
otherwise smooth trail leading through Tir Murann is cracked and splintered 
here. Scattered across the path are fragmented pieces of cobble, posing a 
tripping hazard for anyone not paying careful attention. A split in the path 
leads to an abrupt decline where the debris accumulates. A large wheel is fixed 
to the ground beside the path with a tautly secured rope, tightly wound through 
the pulley and leading out of sight down the hill.

Bottom of a quarry pit. (Tir Murann)
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. The
construction of numerous stone structures begin here, evidenced by the presence
of large solid granite blocks, ranging in age and shape from rough, uncut slabs
to smooth, finished blocks awaiting use. One such finished slab sits on an
overworked cart affixed to a long, thick rope that stretches up the gravel
incline and leads out of the quarry. A long stone has been pushed against the
southern wall, providing a place where a tired worker can rest in the shade for
a break from work and relief the burning heat of the sun during a hot day. A
bayberry tree grows here. Covered with spines, a hawthorn bush is growing.
Several picks line a wooden rack set into the quarry's wall. Ohmut is here,
sitting in the shade as she takes a short break. A towering Vertani guard stands
at attention, casting a watchful eye around him.

hawthorn bush is growing. A bayberry tree grows here. Iazgua, the giant cobra is
