Tellers quickly go about their work, as the masses pour in to deposit what
little gold has not been taken in taxes from their wages. As you push through
the line, a deathly voice asks you for your business. Staring back at you from
across the counter stands a hulking skeleton still fresh with decay. The stench
emanating from the skeleton overwhelms you, and you cover your mouth and try
not to gag. On the far wall, you see the central, and easily the most
impressive feature of this massive building. A huge steel vault door, cut into
the very rock itself, protects the wealth of Mhaldor. Chains drag across the
wooden floor, emitting a ghastly noise. As you look closer, you see they hold
the workers to their desks, allowing little room to move around. A runic totem
is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular
monolith is on the ground. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil.
You see a single exit leading north (open door).

Katia arrives from the north.

Ladydeath, riding an alabaster pegasus, arrives from the north.

Titonus moves over to block the north exit.

Katia grabs Kantor.

Ladydeath growls menacingly at you.

Darroth gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

You exclaim to Katia, "H-hey!"

Kantor whimpers, dropping to his knees.

You exclaim, "That hurts!"

Katia says to you, "Well well, what do we have here?"

Katia says to Ladydeath, "What think you mistress? A lesson need to be taught?"

Kantor shivers in the cold and fear, staring wide-eyed at Katia.

Katia rubs her hands together as an evil grin creeps across her face.

Ladydeath says to you, "What makes you try to sneak into our city?"

Ladydeath gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

You exclaim, "I... I... wanted gold!"

Ladydeath nods her head at Katia.

Ladydeath says, "I think a lesson is definately in order."

Ladydeath brandishes an iron-tipped whip menacingly.

Kantor suddenly breaks free from Katia&#39;s grasp and leaps over the counter,
ducking down behind it.

Katia takes out a rope, binding Kantor&#39;s hands quickly, then tugging him as if
on a leash.

Katia says, "Too slow little one."

Ladydeath rubs her hands together and grins evilly at Katia.

The corners of Katia&#39;s mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

Katia says to Ladydeath, "We need.. somewhere where a little blood won&#39;t make a mess."

Katia tugs on the leash again, causing Kantor to stumble behind her.

Ladydeath says, "What did you have in mind?"

Ladydeath says, "Blood gulch perhaps?"

Throwing her hands in the air, Ladydeath tosses her head back and laughs
sadistically.

Katia ponders the situation.

Katia says, "Blood gulch sounds.. suitable."

Ladydeath says, "The blood won&#39;t matter there. It has seen many days of endless blood suppy."

Kantor struggles within the binds on his hands, whimpering.

Katia smiles impishly and says, "Shall we mistress?"

Ladydeath nods her head emphatically.

You exclaim, "D-don&#39;t kill me!"

Ladydeath opens the door to the north.

The corners of Ladydeath&#39;s mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

Ladydeath says, "Quiet."

Katia says to you, "You&#39;ll beg for it soon enough."

The corners of Katia&#39;s mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

You exclaim, "No!! Please, my mother needs my help!"

Ladydeath moves out to the North with the little prisoner mhun tied up behind
the group.

You follow Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen north to Pestilent
way.

You follow Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen up to Blood Gulch.

Ladydeath nods her head emphatically.

Blood Gulch.
Marring the surface of the mountain itself is a large, gaping wound, the angry
red rock reminiscent of infected flesh. The gash weeps a strange, glistening
moisture, the foul, viscous fluid seeping slowly down the face of the rock.
Fissures spread around the crimson slash, expelling noxious gases redolent of
rot and decay, as if the very mountain were dying. Pooling along the rocky
trail, the seepage coats the ground, making the way treacherous and slick. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. Wings flaring, the pegasus tosses his
regal head impatiently. Domina Furor Ladydeath Aristata is riding on an
alabaster pegasus. She wields an iron-tipped whip in her left hand and a Shield
of Absorption in her right.
You see exits leading up and down.

Titonus moves over to block the down exit.

Kantor&#39;s Current Description
----------------------------
He is a Mhun and is just under five foot, four inches tall. He appears to be
smaller as he is stooped over, slouched down as if in fear. His dark brown,
wide eyes and bushy, black hair further push him into relative obscurity in the
shadows. Through the straps of his leather sandals, you can see several small
blisters and sores. He is wearing a canvas backpack, a flimsy undershirt, a
raggedy old pair of trousers, sturdy brown leather sandals, and a pair of thick
soft brown socks.

Ladydeath says, "This is a good spot."

Katia moves over to block the up exit.

Katia smirks at you.

Ladydeath cackles hellishly.

Ladydeath says to you, "Do you have any clue what we do to those who try to steal from us?"

Katia binds the little mhun to the rock. Stepping back quietly.

Kantor bites his lip, tears streaking from his eyes.

Katia ceases to wield a Shield of Absorption in her right hand.

A look of concentration flashes across Ladydeath&#39;s face and her flesh
solidifies once more.

Katia begins to wield a needle-pointed dirk in her right hand.

You say, "I don&#39;t want to know, ma&#39;am..."

Katia emerges from her hiding place.

Katia says, "Yer about to know.. in detail."

Titonus slowly fades into view, returning to the realm of perception.

You exclaim, "No!"

Ladydeath nods to Katia with a wicked grin.

You exclaim, "Please don&#39;t hurt me!"

Ladydeath says to Katia, "How about you show him a little taste."

Titonus says to you, "I don&#39;t believe that is an option."

You mutter, "M......."

You mutter, "P..ase, mom....."

Ladydeath says to you, "Silence!"

Kantor breaks into a horrific fit of tears, struggling intensely in his binding.

Katia smiles softly, her face taking on an almost kind expression and kneels
infront of the child, her dirk held loosely in her hand.

Katia says to you, "Are you afraid little one?"

You nod your head at Katia.

You nod your head at Katia.

Katia smiles kindly again.

You exclaim, "I&#39;m really afraid. Please don&#39;t!"

Ladydeath ceases to wield an iron-tipped whip in her left hand.

Katia says, "Good."

Ladydeath begins to wield a wicked-looking daegger in her left hand.

Ladydeath steps down off of an alabaster pegasus.

Using a living daegger, Ladydeath opens a vein in her wrist and lets the blood
outline a pentagram, floating waist-high.

Ladydeath easily vaults onto the back of an alabaster pegasus.

Katia drags her dirk along Kantor&#39;s calves, hamstringing him with a
disturbingly practiced motion.

Opening your mouth wide, you gape in wonder at Ladydeath.

Ladydeath ceases to wield a wicked-looking daegger in her left hand.

Throwing back your head, you scream agonizingly.

Ladydeath begins to wield an iron-tipped whip in her left hand.

Titonus takes a blackened warhammer from a Mhunskin backpack.

Titonus starts to wield a blackened warhammer in his hands.

Titonus&#39;s knuckles grow momentarily white as he strengthens his grip.

The corners of Katia&#39;s mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

A dazzling ray of light shoots from the horizon to a point high in the Southern
Vashnars as the still-veiled sun begins her laborious daily ascent.

Ladydeath cackles hellishly.

You yell, "That hurt! Not again, please!"

Titonus smirks.

Katia strokes Kantor&#39;s cheek with a soft touch, wiping his tears away.

Katia says, "Hush hush little one.. every scream, causes more pain."

Ladydeath&#39;s eyes sparkle as she watches the calf start to bleed.

Titonus says, "And there is no one here who will help you."

Kantor shakes his head in disbelief, pulling away from your touch.

Ladydeath says to you, "If you yell again like that, I will slice your throat
slowly and let you watch yourself bleed to death."

Katia turns her dirk in her hand, pondering it&#39;s shard edges, then looking
thoughtfully at the mhun.

Katia says, "Silence.. might be given, as a gift little one."

Kantor gulps nervously, shutting his mouth tight.

Ladydeath gives you the once over.

Titonus gives you the once over.

Katia her gentle hand tightens its grip, squeezing the boys jaw, forcing his
mouth open.

Katia says, "Tongue.. out."

The corners of Titonus&#39;s mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

"Oooooooooh!" Ladydeath says, eyes wide with wonder.

Kantor pulls his tongue back into his mouth, his eyes becoming as wide as saucers.

Ladydeath says to Katia, "Mind if I have the pleasure this time?"

Katia says to Ladydeath, "Well of course mistress, let me just.."

Katia slaps Kantor&#39;s cheek, and growls.

You exclaim, "Pahlease! No mahr harting!"

Katia says, "Tongue.. out."

Titonus urges his companions onwards.

Titonus leaves to the down.

Kantor braces himself against the rock, using all of his strength to keep his
tongue within his mouth.

Titonus arrives from the down.

Titonus moves over to block the down exit.

A ghostly apparition glides into view from the down.

Katia uses her dirk, and pries Kantor&#39;s jaws open.

Ladydeath smirks at the little mhun and suddenly pinches his nose between her
fingers. "You were told to stick your tongue out. Do it now!"

Kantor quickly begins to gag, and lets his head drop in exhaustion. Slowly,
his tongue rolls out of his open mouth.

A ghostly apparition glides into view from the down.

Ladydeath&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

With a flourish of his arm, Arcrisius bows deeply.

Ladydeath curtseys respectfully before Arcrisius.

Ladydeath says to Arcrisius, "Care to enjoy our show?"

You say to Arcrisius, "Please... help me..."

Arcrisius stands up and stretches his arms out wide.

Ladydeath growls menacingly at you.

Katia gives a trillingly melodic laugh.

Katia says, "Wrong person to ask little one."

Ladydeath ceases to wield an iron-tipped whip in her left hand.

Ladydeath begins to wield a wicked-looking daegger in her left hand.

Titonus says to you, "Sorry, small one, no more left."

You say, "I don&#39;t want to... hurt anymore... please..."

Katia says, "We&#39;ve barely started."

You ask, "Is there... anything... I can do?"

Ladydeath closes in on Kantor with her daegger and snatches his tongue with her
other hand. She slices it out faster than he has time to even blink.

Throwing her hands in the air, Ladydeath tosses her head back and laughs
sadistically.

Titonus says, "Can I crush his feet?"

Ladydeath looks about herself, rubbing her chin thoughtfully.

Katia says to you, "Truth seven little one.. The spirit may be made stronger by
enduring hardships, both self-imposed."

Katia says to you, "And externally-imposed."

Ladydeath nods her head at Titonus.

Kantor looks up at Katia curiously.

Katia says, "We wish.. only to make you stronger little one.."

Katia rubs her hands together as an evil grin creeps across her face.

Ladydeath says, "Continue and let him hear of our Seven truths as you make
him learn of Suffering as well."

Kantor is barely able to mouth the word "truth", looking inquisitively at Katia.

Titonus swings his blackened warhammer in a wide arc, and glances into Kantors
eyes, before bringing it crashing down on his left foot.

Katia says, "Truth three Cruelty - the application of pain - is the method by
which one weeds out the weak and feeble-minded from the population."

Kantor pulls his left foot back in pain, striking it against the rock and
hurting it even worse.

Katia says, "Truth two actually."

Ladydeath says, "There are far too few things as satisfying as the suffering of others."

The veiled sun continues her heavenly ascent. Stars glitter with unchallenged
brilliance in the shadowed sky.

The floating pentagram suddenly vanishes into thin air.

Titonus empties out a rosewood vial on top of you, covering you in blood.

Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen says, "Truth three however..
Weakness must be eliminated in all its forms: Physical, Mental, and Spiritual."

Katia digs her dirk into Kantor&#39;s calves again, slashing muscle and sinew.

Kantor drops to his knees forcibly, wincing in sheer, white-hot pain.

Katia speaks quietly to Kantor, a caring expression on her face, "Do you feel
the weakness leaving you little one?"

Ladydeath says, "It is much nicer now that he can&#39;t whine and complain."

The corners of Ladydeath&#39;s mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

Katia grins mischievously at Ladydeath.

Titonus drags the head of his hammer, slowly threw the dirt at his feet.

Katia says to Titonus, "Other foot I think, to show how foolish he was to run."

Ladydeath says, "Or maybe just the toes one by one so he can savor the pain."

Ladydeath&#39;s eyes twinkle enchantingly.

The corners of Katia&#39;s mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

Titonus obeying Katia, raises his hammer over his head, and swings down
powerfully at Kantor&#39;s foot, misses completely, and shatters Kantors right
shin.

"Oops!" Titonus exclaims with a bashful expression.

Katia waggles a finger warningly at Titonus and says, "Tut tut."

Ladydeath cackles hellishly.

Ladydeath says, "Messy."

Katia says, "Try again."

Kantor gasps in pain, falling down upon his right side. His arms hang
outstretched, still chained to the rock.

Ladydeath runs a finger down Kantor&#39;s bloody shin and digs her nail into the
aching wound.

Titonus with a more vigilant look, raises his hammer again, this time striking
true, destroying the bones in Kantors right foot.

Titonus picks up one of Kantors big toes off of the ground.

Katia pets Kantor on the cheek, almost motherly. "Well little one, do you feel
the weakness leaving you yet?"

Titonus offers a toe to Ladydeath.

Ladydeath smirks.

Kantor nods slowly, unsure.

Titonus puts a severed toe into an empty vial.

Ladydeath puts the severed toe into her pack cackling.

Ladydeath says, "I can keep that for fond memories."

An unnatural deep night reigns over the land, the shining sun thrice eclipsed
upon her apex in the heavens.

Kantor begins to fade, his skin paling in the darkness as the blood leaves his
body slowly but surely.

Katia says, "These things will regrow, you will be stronger, such as Maya allows,
but I shall leave you one mark.. that will never fade."

Katia takes her dirk, and neatly carves an M into Kantor&#39;s cheek, then with a
handful of soot from her tinderbox, rubs it into the cut, guaranteeing a
permanent scar.

Titonus says, "Do we have some fire wood?"

Ladydeath nods her head emphatically.

Titonus says, "And an iron?"

Katia says, "He&#39;s branded.. leave it at that."

Titonus gives a pained sigh.

Titonus nods his head emphatically.

Katia says to you, "Remember I said you would beg for death?"

Ladydeath takes her tinderbox from her sleeve and lights her daegger. She leans
in and traces over the M carved by Katia.

Ladydeath says, "That should be hot enough to seal it."

Katia says to you, "Beg.. and I shall grant it."

Kantor&#39;s Current Description
----------------------------
He is a Mhun and is just under five foot, four inches tall. He appears to be
smaller as he is stooped over, slouched down as if in fear. His dark brown,
wide eyes and bushy, black hair further push him into relative obscurity in the
shadows. Through the straps of his leather sandals, you can see several small
blisters and sores. Upon his cheek is a dark, very noticeable scar in the image
of the letter &#39;M&#39;. He is wearing a canvas backpack, a flimsy undershirt, a
raggedy old pair of trousers, sturdy brown leather sandals, and a pair of thick
soft brown socks.

Titonus puts a blackened warhammer into a Mhunskin backpack.

Kantor weakly nods at Katia.

Katia says, "There is one.. condition."

Kantor allows his eyes to fall upon his broken body, grunting in pain and understanding.

Katia says, "You are mhaldors now, always."

Katia sinks her fangs into your body and you wince in pain.
You scream out in agony as a vicious venom tears through your body.

Katia sinks her fangs into your body and you wince in pain.
You scream out in agony as a vicious venom tears through your body.
You stiffen and drop dead as the venom proves too much for your system.
You have been slain by Katia.

Katia says, "Grow stronger."

Ladydeath steps down off of an alabaster pegasus.

Ladydeath easily vaults onto the back of an alabaster pegasus.

Your mana drains away as you concentrate on maintaining a link with the living.

You are dead, perhaps you should "Pray for Salvation".

Ladydeath says, "Offer him to our Lord."

Titonus says, "And his head?"

Katia begins chopping away at the neck of the corpse of Kantor with a whip of
taming.

You say, "I w-will, mistress..."

Your mana drains away as you concentrate on maintaining a link with the living.

Ladydeath says, "In the idol."

Katia finishes decapitating the corpse of Kantor, leaving only a pool of blood
where the head had been.

Katia picks up the decapitated head of Kantor.

Katia picks up a headless corpse.

You are dead, perhaps you should "Pray for Salvation".

Katia says, "Pray Kantor.. and return."

Your mana drains away as you concentrate on maintaining a link with the living.
say I th-thank you...

You say, "I th-thank you..."

The light seems to fade and darkness envelops your consciousness...

After Praying...
----------------
Kantor enters from below, stooped low and hidden partially in the shadows.

Titonus drags Kantor into the light, sitting him down on a blood soaked rock.

A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room.

Ladydeath steps down off of an alabaster pegasus.

Using a living daegger, Ladydeath opens a vein in her wrist and lets the blood
outline a pentagram, floating waist-high.

Ladydeath conjures up images of unspeakable acts, and forces them to take
semi-corporeal form.

Katia suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.

Katia says to you, "Follow me slave."

You begin to follow Katia.

Katia says to you, "You are mhaldors now, let us make it obvious."

You follow Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen down to Pestilent
way.

You follow Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen southeast to Circle
of Pain.

You follow Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen southeast to Circle

Nefarious way.

You follow Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen south to Nefarious
way.

You follow Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen south to Nefarious
way.

You follow Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen south to Avenue of
trapped souls.

Ladydeath, riding an alabaster pegasus, arrives from the north.

Katia points accusingly at a massive tree.

Katia says to you, "Read that, and then read it out loud.. and remember to kneel."

Titonus arrives from the north.

Kantor nods weakly at Katia, turning his attention upon the tree.

The faint sound of hushed voices drifts by you on the night-time breeze.

You drop to one knee, demonstrating your humility and respect.

You gulp nervously.

You say, "I he-hereby give my soul to serve Lords Shaitan and Apollyon in my
eternal service to Mhaldor. My bl-blades to purge the weak, my b-body to
protect our land, my mind to spread the teachings of Lords Shaitan and Apollyon
and my soul to serve them in... death."

Katia asks you to repeat the oaths of citizenship after her. You do, and you
are admitted as the newest, proudest member of Mhaldor!

Katia smirks at you.

Kantor drops his head in shame.

Balancing on the rim of the world, Lady Sol prepares to enter her daily
slumber, accompanied by her triune guards.

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.

Scarlatti&#39;s Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le&#39;Murzen says, "Welcome to mhaldor."

~~~~ AFTER THE BRANDING, MY DESCRIPTION ~~~~

He is a Mhun and is just under five foot, four inches tall. He appears to be
smaller as he is stooped over, slouched down as if in fear. His dark brown,
wide eyes and bushy, black hair further push him into relative obscurity in the
shadows. Through the straps of his leather sandals, you can see several small
blisters and sores through the holes in his socks. Upon his cheek is a dark,
very noticeable carving of the letter &#39;M&#39;, superimposed by the image of a
coiled, scarlet serpent. He is wearing a canvas backpack, a flimsy undershirt,
a raggedy old pair of trousers, sturdy brown leather sandals, and a pair of
thick soft brown socks.'>The Vault.
Tellers quickly go about their work, as the masses pour in to deposit what
little gold has not been taken in taxes from their wages. As you push through
the line, a deathly voice asks you for your business. Staring back at you from
across the counter stands a hulking skeleton still fresh with decay. The stench
emanating from the skeleton overwhelms you, and you cover your mouth and try
not to gag. On the far wall, you see the central, and easily the most
impressive feature of this massive building. A huge steel vault door, cut into
the very rock itself, protects the wealth of Mhaldor. Chains drag across the
wooden floor, emitting a ghastly noise. As you look closer, you see they hold
the workers to their desks, allowing little room to move around. A runic totem
is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular
monolith is on the ground. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil.

Ladydeath, riding an alabaster pegasus, arrives from the north.
Titonus moves over to block the north exit.
Katia grabs Kantor.
Ladydeath growls menacingly at you.
Darroth gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.
You exclaim to Katia, "H-hey!"
Kantor whimpers, dropping to his knees.
You exclaim, "That hurts!"
Katia says to you, "Well well, what do we have here?"
Katia says to Ladydeath, "What think you mistress? A lesson need to be taught?"
Kantor shivers in the cold and fear, staring wide-eyed at Katia.
Katia rubs her hands together as an evil grin creeps across her face.
Ladydeath says to you, "What makes you try to sneak into our city?"
Ladydeath gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.
You exclaim, "I... I... wanted gold!"
Ladydeath nods her head at Katia.
Ladydeath says, "I think a lesson is definately in order."
Ladydeath brandishes an iron-tipped whip menacingly.
Kantor suddenly breaks free from Katia's grasp and leaps over the counter,
ducking down behind it.
Katia takes out a rope, binding Kantor's hands quickly, then tugging him as if
on a leash.
Katia says, "Too slow little one."
Ladydeath rubs her hands together and grins evilly at Katia.
The corners of Katia's mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.
Katia says to Ladydeath, "We need.. somewhere where a little blood won't make a mess."
Katia tugs on the leash again, causing Kantor to stumble behind her.
Ladydeath says, "What did you have in mind?"
Ladydeath says, "Blood gulch perhaps?"
Throwing her hands in the air, Ladydeath tosses her head back and laughs
sadistically.
Katia ponders the situation.
Katia says, "Blood gulch sounds.. suitable."
Ladydeath says, "The blood won't matter there. It has seen many days of endless blood suppy."
Kantor struggles within the binds on his hands, whimpering.
Katia smiles impishly and says, "Shall we mistress?"
Ladydeath nods her head emphatically.
You exclaim, "D-don't kill me!"
Ladydeath opens the door to the north.
The corners of Ladydeath's mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.
Ladydeath says, "Quiet."
Katia says to you, "You'll beg for it soon enough."
The corners of Katia's mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.
You exclaim, "No!! Please, my mother needs my help!"
Ladydeath moves out to the North with the little prisoner mhun tied up behind
the group.
You follow Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen north to Pestilent
way.
You follow Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen up to Blood Gulch.
Ladydeath nods her head emphatically.
Blood Gulch.
Marring the surface of the mountain itself is a large, gaping wound, the angry
red rock reminiscent of infected flesh. The gash weeps a strange, glistening
moisture, the foul, viscous fluid seeping slowly down the face of the rock.
Fissures spread around the crimson slash, expelling noxious gases redolent of
rot and decay, as if the very mountain were dying. Pooling along the rocky
trail, the seepage coats the ground, making the way treacherous and slick. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. Wings flaring, the pegasus tosses his
regal head impatiently. Domina Furor Ladydeath Aristata is riding on an
alabaster pegasus. She wields an iron-tipped whip in her left hand and a Shield
of Absorption in her right.
You see exits leading up and down.
Titonus moves over to block the down exit.
Kantor's Current Description
----------------------------
He is a Mhun and is just under five foot, four inches tall. He appears to be
smaller as he is stooped over, slouched down as if in fear. His dark brown,
wide eyes and bushy, black hair further push him into relative obscurity in the
shadows. Through the straps of his leather sandals, you can see several small
blisters and sores. He is wearing a canvas backpack, a flimsy undershirt, a
raggedy old pair of trousers, sturdy brown leather sandals, and a pair of thick
soft brown socks.
Ladydeath says, "This is a good spot."
Katia moves over to block the up exit.
Katia smirks at you.
Ladydeath cackles hellishly.
Ladydeath says to you, "Do you have any clue what we do to those who try to steal from us?"
Katia binds the little mhun to the rock. Stepping back quietly.
Kantor bites his lip, tears streaking from his eyes.
Katia ceases to wield a Shield of Absorption in her right hand.
A look of concentration flashes across Ladydeath's face and her flesh
solidifies once more.
Katia begins to wield a needle-pointed dirk in her right hand.
You say, "I don't want to know, ma'am..."
Katia emerges from her hiding place.
Katia says, "Yer about to know.. in detail."
Titonus slowly fades into view, returning to the realm of perception.
You exclaim, "No!"
Ladydeath nods to Katia with a wicked grin.
You exclaim, "Please don't hurt me!"
Ladydeath says to Katia, "How about you show him a little taste."
Titonus says to you, "I don't believe that is an option."
You mutter, "M......."
You mutter, "P..ase, mom....."
Ladydeath says to you, "Silence!"
Kantor breaks into a horrific fit of tears, struggling intensely in his binding.
Katia smiles softly, her face taking on an almost kind expression and kneels
infront of the child, her dirk held loosely in her hand.
Katia says to you, "Are you afraid little one?"
You nod your head at Katia.
You nod your head at Katia.
Katia smiles kindly again.
You exclaim, "I'm really afraid. Please don't!"
Ladydeath ceases to wield an iron-tipped whip in her left hand.
Katia says, "Good."
Ladydeath begins to wield a wicked-looking daegger in her left hand.
Ladydeath steps down off of an alabaster pegasus.
Using a living daegger, Ladydeath opens a vein in her wrist and lets the blood
outline a pentagram, floating waist-high.
Ladydeath easily vaults onto the back of an alabaster pegasus.
Katia drags her dirk along Kantor's calves, hamstringing him with a
disturbingly practiced motion.
Opening your mouth wide, you gape in wonder at Ladydeath.
Ladydeath ceases to wield a wicked-looking daegger in her left hand.
Throwing back your head, you scream agonizingly.
Ladydeath begins to wield an iron-tipped whip in her left hand.
Titonus takes a blackened warhammer from a Mhunskin backpack.
Titonus starts to wield a blackened warhammer in his hands.
Titonus's knuckles grow momentarily white as he strengthens his grip.
The corners of Katia's mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.
A dazzling ray of light shoots from the horizon to a point high in the Southern
Vashnars as the still-veiled sun begins her laborious daily ascent.
Ladydeath cackles hellishly.
You yell, "That hurt! Not again, please!"
Titonus smirks.
Katia strokes Kantor's cheek with a soft touch, wiping his tears away.
Katia says, "Hush hush little one.. every scream, causes more pain."
Ladydeath's eyes sparkle as she watches the calf start to bleed.
Titonus says, "And there is no one here who will help you."
Kantor shakes his head in disbelief, pulling away from your touch.
Ladydeath says to you, "If you yell again like that, I will slice your throat
slowly and let you watch yourself bleed to death."
Katia turns her dirk in her hand, pondering it's shard edges, then looking
thoughtfully at the mhun.
Katia says, "Silence.. might be given, as a gift little one."
Kantor gulps nervously, shutting his mouth tight.
Ladydeath gives you the once over.
Titonus gives you the once over.
Katia her gentle hand tightens its grip, squeezing the boys jaw, forcing his
mouth open.
Katia says, "Tongue.. out."
The corners of Titonus's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
"Oooooooooh!" Ladydeath says, eyes wide with wonder.
Kantor pulls his tongue back into his mouth, his eyes becoming as wide as saucers.
Ladydeath says to Katia, "Mind if I have the pleasure this time?"
Katia says to Ladydeath, "Well of course mistress, let me just.."
Katia slaps Kantor's cheek, and growls.
You exclaim, "Pahlease! No mahr harting!"
Katia says, "Tongue.. out."
Titonus urges his companions onwards.
Titonus leaves to the down.
Kantor braces himself against the rock, using all of his strength to keep his
tongue within his mouth.
Titonus arrives from the down.
Titonus moves over to block the down exit.
A ghostly apparition glides into view from the down.
Katia uses her dirk, and pries Kantor's jaws open.
Ladydeath smirks at the little mhun and suddenly pinches his nose between her
fingers. "You were told to stick your tongue out. Do it now!"
Kantor quickly begins to gag, and lets his head drop in exhaustion. Slowly,
his tongue rolls out of his open mouth.
A ghostly apparition glides into view from the down.
Ladydeath's eyes sparkle with amusement.
With a flourish of his arm, Arcrisius bows deeply.
Ladydeath curtseys respectfully before Arcrisius.
Ladydeath says to Arcrisius, "Care to enjoy our show?"
You say to Arcrisius, "Please... help me..."
Arcrisius stands up and stretches his arms out wide.
Ladydeath growls menacingly at you.
Katia gives a trillingly melodic laugh.
Katia says, "Wrong person to ask little one."
Ladydeath ceases to wield an iron-tipped whip in her left hand.
Ladydeath begins to wield a wicked-looking daegger in her left hand.
Titonus says to you, "Sorry, small one, no more left."
You say, "I don't want to... hurt anymore... please..."
Katia says, "We've barely started."
You ask, "Is there... anything... I can do?"
Ladydeath closes in on Kantor with her daegger and snatches his tongue with her
other hand. She slices it out faster than he has time to even blink.
Throwing her hands in the air, Ladydeath tosses her head back and laughs
sadistically.
Titonus says, "Can I crush his feet?"
Ladydeath looks about herself, rubbing her chin thoughtfully.
Katia says to you, "Truth seven little one.. The spirit may be made stronger by
enduring hardships, both self-imposed."
Katia says to you, "And externally-imposed."
Ladydeath nods her head at Titonus.
Kantor looks up at Katia curiously.
Katia says, "We wish.. only to make you stronger little one.."
Katia rubs her hands together as an evil grin creeps across her face.
Ladydeath says, "Continue and let him hear of our Seven truths as you make
him learn of Suffering as well."
Kantor is barely able to mouth the word "truth", looking inquisitively at Katia.
Titonus swings his blackened warhammer in a wide arc, and glances into Kantors
eyes, before bringing it crashing down on his left foot.
Katia says, "Truth three Cruelty - the application of pain - is the method by
which one weeds out the weak and feeble-minded from the population."
Kantor pulls his left foot back in pain, striking it against the rock and
hurting it even worse.
Katia says, "Truth two actually."
Ladydeath says, "There are far too few things as satisfying as the suffering of others."
The veiled sun continues her heavenly ascent. Stars glitter with unchallenged
brilliance in the shadowed sky.
The floating pentagram suddenly vanishes into thin air.
Titonus empties out a rosewood vial on top of you, covering you in blood.
Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen says, "Truth three however..
Weakness must be eliminated in all its forms: Physical, Mental, and Spiritual."
Katia digs her dirk into Kantor's calves again, slashing muscle and sinew.
Kantor drops to his knees forcibly, wincing in sheer, white-hot pain.
Katia speaks quietly to Kantor, a caring expression on her face, "Do you feel
the weakness leaving you little one?"
Ladydeath says, "It is much nicer now that he can't whine and complain."
The corners of Ladydeath's mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.
Katia grins mischievously at Ladydeath.
Titonus drags the head of his hammer, slowly threw the dirt at his feet.
Katia says to Titonus, "Other foot I think, to show how foolish he was to run."
Ladydeath says, "Or maybe just the toes one by one so he can savor the pain."
Ladydeath's eyes twinkle enchantingly.
The corners of Katia's mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.
Titonus obeying Katia, raises his hammer over his head, and swings down
powerfully at Kantor's foot, misses completely, and shatters Kantors right
shin.
"Oops!" Titonus exclaims with a bashful expression.
Katia waggles a finger warningly at Titonus and says, "Tut tut."
Ladydeath cackles hellishly.
Ladydeath says, "Messy."
Katia says, "Try again."
Kantor gasps in pain, falling down upon his right side. His arms hang
outstretched, still chained to the rock.
Ladydeath runs a finger down Kantor's bloody shin and digs her nail into the
aching wound.
Titonus with a more vigilant look, raises his hammer again, this time striking
true, destroying the bones in Kantors right foot.
Titonus picks up one of Kantors big toes off of the ground.
Katia pets Kantor on the cheek, almost motherly. "Well little one, do you feel
the weakness leaving you yet?"
Titonus offers a toe to Ladydeath.
Ladydeath smirks.
Kantor nods slowly, unsure.
Titonus puts a severed toe into an empty vial.
Ladydeath puts the severed toe into her pack cackling.
Ladydeath says, "I can keep that for fond memories."
An unnatural deep night reigns over the land, the shining sun thrice eclipsed
upon her apex in the heavens.
Kantor begins to fade, his skin paling in the darkness as the blood leaves his
body slowly but surely.
Katia says, "These things will regrow, you will be stronger, such as Maya allows,
but I shall leave you one mark.. that will never fade."
Katia takes her dirk, and neatly carves an M into Kantor's cheek, then with a
handful of soot from her tinderbox, rubs it into the cut, guaranteeing a
permanent scar.
Titonus says, "Do we have some fire wood?"
Ladydeath nods her head emphatically.
Titonus says, "And an iron?"
Katia says, "He's branded.. leave it at that."
Titonus gives a pained sigh.
Titonus nods his head emphatically.
Katia says to you, "Remember I said you would beg for death?"
Ladydeath takes her tinderbox from her sleeve and lights her daegger. She leans
in and traces over the M carved by Katia.
Ladydeath says, "That should be hot enough to seal it."
Katia says to you, "Beg.. and I shall grant it."
Kantor's Current Description
----------------------------
He is a Mhun and is just under five foot, four inches tall. He appears to be
smaller as he is stooped over, slouched down as if in fear. His dark brown,
wide eyes and bushy, black hair further push him into relative obscurity in the
shadows. Through the straps of his leather sandals, you can see several small
blisters and sores. Upon his cheek is a dark, very noticeable scar in the image
of the letter 'M'. He is wearing a canvas backpack, a flimsy undershirt, a
raggedy old pair of trousers, sturdy brown leather sandals, and a pair of thick
soft brown socks.
Titonus puts a blackened warhammer into a Mhunskin backpack.
Kantor weakly nods at Katia.
Katia says, "There is one.. condition."
Kantor allows his eyes to fall upon his broken body, grunting in pain and understanding.
Katia says, "You are mhaldors now, always."
Katia sinks her fangs into your body and you wince in pain.
You scream out in agony as a vicious venom tears through your body.
Katia sinks her fangs into your body and you wince in pain.
You scream out in agony as a vicious venom tears through your body.
You stiffen and drop dead as the venom proves too much for your system.
You have been slain by Katia.
Katia says, "Grow stronger."
Ladydeath steps down off of an alabaster pegasus.
Ladydeath easily vaults onto the back of an alabaster pegasus.
Your mana drains away as you concentrate on maintaining a link with the living.
You are dead, perhaps you should "Pray for Salvation".
Ladydeath says, "Offer him to our Lord."
Titonus says, "And his head?"
Katia begins chopping away at the neck of the corpse of Kantor with a whip of
taming.
You say, "I w-will, mistress..."
Your mana drains away as you concentrate on maintaining a link with the living.
Ladydeath says, "In the idol."
Katia finishes decapitating the corpse of Kantor, leaving only a pool of blood
where the head had been.
Katia picks up the decapitated head of Kantor.
Katia picks up a headless corpse.
You are dead, perhaps you should "Pray for Salvation".
Katia says, "Pray Kantor.. and return."
Your mana drains away as you concentrate on maintaining a link with the living.
say I th-thank you...
You say, "I th-thank you..."
The light seems to fade and darkness envelops your consciousness...
After Praying...
----------------
Kantor enters from below, stooped low and hidden partially in the shadows.
Titonus drags Kantor into the light, sitting him down on a blood soaked rock.
A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room.
Ladydeath steps down off of an alabaster pegasus.
Using a living daegger, Ladydeath opens a vein in her wrist and lets the blood
outline a pentagram, floating waist-high.
Ladydeath conjures up images of unspeakable acts, and forces them to take
semi-corporeal form.
Katia suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.
Katia says to you, "Follow me slave."
You begin to follow Katia.
Katia says to you, "You are mhaldors now, let us make it obvious."
You follow Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen down to Pestilent
way.
You follow Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen southeast to Circle
of Pain.
You follow Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen southeast to Circle

way.
You follow Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen south to Nefarious
way.
You follow Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen south to Avenue of
trapped souls.
Ladydeath, riding an alabaster pegasus, arrives from the north.
Katia points accusingly at a massive tree.
Katia says to you, "Read that, and then read it out loud.. and remember to kneel."
Titonus arrives from the north.
Kantor nods weakly at Katia, turning his attention upon the tree.
The faint sound of hushed voices drifts by you on the night-time breeze.
You drop to one knee, demonstrating your humility and respect.
You gulp nervously.
You say, "I he-hereby give my soul to serve Lords Shaitan and Apollyon in my
eternal service to Mhaldor. My bl-blades to purge the weak, my b-body to
protect our land, my mind to spread the teachings of Lords Shaitan and Apollyon
and my soul to serve them in... death."
Katia asks you to repeat the oaths of citizenship after her. You do, and you
are admitted as the newest, proudest member of Mhaldor!
Katia smirks at you.
Kantor drops his head in shame.
Balancing on the rim of the world, Lady Sol prepares to enter her daily
slumber, accompanied by her triune guards.
You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.
Scarlatti's Dark Muse, Katia Lokelinde Le'Murzen says, "Welcome to mhaldor."
