The sound grows to monstrous proportions and suddenly twists to formulate words. A great, gravelly voice calls out in thunderous tones, "Where is it?".

A buzzing mass forms in the sky, swirling and roiling like angry thunderheads in a storm spinning faster and faster until with a clap of thunder, Sarapis appears, His brow twisted in anger.

All reality shudders as the voice of Sarapis, the Logos thunders across the land, "Hmm, one of My sacred artifacts is missing, and I see that it has been somewhat widely used. Who is responsible for this??"

All reality shudders as the voice of Sarapis, the Logos thunders across the land, "Tsian tells me it was Pandora."

All reality shudders as the voice of Sarapis, the Logos thunders across the land, "Pandora, where are you. Get out here."

All reality shudders as the voice of Sarapis, the Logos thunders across the land, "NOW PANDORA."

A sound reaches your ears, barely audible and its nature under the circumstances utterly unbelievable. Just in your range of hearing, is a muffledsound of giggling.

All reality shudders as the voice of Sarapis, the Logos thunders across the land, "You dare to laugh? Considering what You have stolen from Me, and caused unnecessary harm to the mortals, I expect abject contrition, not snickers and laughter."

A sparkling mist of green droplets twinkles into being before Sarapis, and a bright voice says, "Have it back then, it&#39;s boring now anyway. It doesn&#39;t turn anybody into anything more interesting than a maggot." The sound of a bored yawn stretches languidly into the air.

Sarapis&#39;s face clouds over with anger and the rumbling sound begins to rise once more as an audible measure of His wrath. Pandora is flung forcibly from the ether, looking tiny and vulnerable before Sarapis&#39; great, angry form. Drawing Himself up, He booms, "What have You got to say for Yourself?".

Wrinkling Her brow in thought, Pandora considers Her words carefully, before saying clearly and cheerfully, "I should have picked up the big round thing with the spiky bits and the little lights, I&#39;ll have to get that one next time!".

The roiling mass of dark matter that makes up Sarapis&#39;s visible form begins to thrum more violently, and the crashing noise reaches a volume that is both painful and petrifying. Sarapis raises His arms above His head to strike Pandora there in front of Him, His frame shaking with pent-up rage and His face contorting with the effort of holding back His anger.

Suddenly, able to hold it no more, Sarapis throws His hands towards Pandora and roars with...laughter! Great, booming waves of laughter pour over Sapience, and tears of molten rock pour down Sarapis&#39; cheeks as He stands before Pandora, laughing. Wiping the tears from His eyes, Sarapis says, "Pandora, You have a lot to learn about life among Us and among the mortals of this world, and Your behavior is not what is to be expected of an Immortal. However, You are young, and must be taught and so this once, I am going to allow You to walk freely from this incident with no punishment.".

Pandora smiles, relieved. She holds out her hand to Sarapis and says, "Can you take it back now?" Looking closely, Sarapis frowns. "It looks as though You are not getting away so unscathed after all. The Caduceus of Castigation is something to be used lightly and infrequently, it begins to mould itself to the wielder if misused. It appears that in My absence, You have more than misused it and it&#39;s now impossible to take off. Pandora, You have a choice. Keep it fused to Your hand and bear the pain for eternity, or I can remove the Caduceus of Castigation, taking Your hand with it.".

Her eyes widening in horror, Pandora looks at Her hand and tears begin to fill Her eyes. "It hurts too much to keep it there, please take it off!", She pleads. Nodding gravely, Sarapis raises the Logosian Whip above His head and lashes it around Pandora&#39;s wrist. Snapping it back sharply, He rips Her hand off cleanly. Patting Her sobbing form on the head lightly, He says, "I&#39;m sure Phaestus can forge you a new one. Let this be a lesson to You child, Your actions have consequences, for every action, a reaction. You must consider before You act and be mindful of the balance in life. To the mortals, I warn you, Pandora is young, and She is thus far untrained. She does not know how to behave towards you yet and She is likely to turn you into something different as to look at you. Do not trust Her! To remind everyone of this, I name Her Pandora, Goddess of Mischief!".'>A vast rumbling sound begins to build in the air, as though mountains are being overturned and the skies are crumbling.
