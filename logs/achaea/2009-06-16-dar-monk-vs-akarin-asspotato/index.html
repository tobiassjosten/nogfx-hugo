flowers speckle the verdant patches of growth. Wings folded against his back, 
Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Eyes flickering briefly 
from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its 
master's side. Vicar Akarin Azon-Vallah, Scourge of the Faith is here. He wields a

Gaian forest near Modi river.
The large oak trees thin in number, making way for crack willows and slender alder. 
The sound of rushing water wafts through the trees, mingling with birdsong and the 
gentle rustle of leaves as breezes drift through the forest. Moist and fertile, the 
earth creates the perfect conditions for mosses and clover to thrive, and tiny white 
flowers speckle the verdant patches of growth. Wings folded against his back, 
Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Eyes flickering briefly 
from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its 
master's side. Vicar Akarin Azon-Vallah, Scourge of the Faith is riding on Xi'vyar, 
an infernal cerberus. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Shaitan in

In the Gaian forest.
Knotted undergrowth entwines with small saplings to make passage difficult through 
the forest, the leafy mass crowding the trunks of the large oaks and hazel trees. A 
canopy of leaves casts a cool shadow over the forest floor, and the scent of loam and
damp earth hangs heavy in the air. Chattering back and forth, squirrels dart along 
the branches high above, searching for tasty morsels amongst the treetops and 
occasionally leaving the safety of the trees to gather the nuts and berries that have
fallen into the bramble below. Wings folded against his back, Xi'vyar, an infernal 
cerberus, stands here silent and still. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram 
floats in mid-air. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. 
Vicar Akarin Azon-Vallah, Scourge of the Faith is riding on Xi'vyar, an infernal 
cerberus. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand and a Shield of 
Absorption bearing the arms of Shaitan in his right.

2504h, 3343m, 12611e, 10878w cxkdb-+++++--
In the Gaian forest.
Knotted undergrowth entwines with small saplings to make passage difficult through 
the forest, the leafy mass crowding the trunks of the large oaks and hazel trees. A 
canopy of leaves casts a cool shadow over the forest floor, and the scent of loam and
damp earth hangs heavy in the air. Chattering back and forth, squirrels dart along 
the branches high above, searching for tasty morsels amongst the treetops and 
occasionally leaving the safety of the trees to gather the nuts and berries that have
fallen into the bramble below. Wings folded against his back, Xi'vyar, an infernal 
cerberus, stands here silent and still. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram 
floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and contort
to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Eyes 
flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and 
hovers close to its master's side. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from
the ground. Vicar Akarin Azon-Vallah, Scourge of the Faith is riding on Xi'vyar, an 
infernal cerberus. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Shaitan in 
his right hand.
You see exits leading east and northwest.

Gaian forest near Modi river.
The large oak trees thin in number, making way for crack willows and slender alder.
The sound of rushing water wafts through the trees, mingling with birdsong and the
gentle rustle of leaves as breezes drift through the forest. Moist and fertile, the
earth creates the perfect conditions for mosses and clover to thrive, and tiny white
flowers speckle the verdant patches of growth. Wings folded against his back,
Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Eyes flickering briefly
from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its
master's side. Vicar Akarin Azon-Vallah, Scourge of the Faith is riding on Xi'vyar,
an infernal cerberus. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Shaitan in
his right hand.

In the Gaian forest.
Knotted undergrowth entwines with small saplings to make passage difficult through
the forest, the leafy mass crowding the trunks of the large oaks and hazel trees. A
canopy of leaves casts a cool shadow over the forest floor, and the scent of loam and
damp earth hangs heavy in the air. Chattering back and forth, squirrels dart along
the branches high above, searching for tasty morsels amongst the treetops and
occasionally leaving the safety of the trees to gather the nuts and berries that have
fallen into the bramble below. Wings folded against his back, Xi'vyar, an infernal

In the Gaian forest.
Knotted undergrowth entwines with small saplings to make passage difficult through
the forest, the leafy mass crowding the trunks of the large oaks and hazel trees. A
canopy of leaves casts a cool shadow over the forest floor, and the scent of loam and
damp earth hangs heavy in the air. Chattering back and forth, squirrels dart along
the branches high above, searching for tasty morsels amongst the treetops and
occasionally leaving the safety of the trees to gather the nuts and berries that have
fallen into the bramble below. Wings folded against his back, Xi'vyar, an infernal
cerberus, stands here silent and still. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram
floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and contort
to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Eyes
flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and
hovers close to its master's side. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from
the ground. Vicar Akarin Azon-Vallah, Scourge of the Faith is riding on Xi'vyar, an
infernal cerberus. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Shaitan in
his right hand.
