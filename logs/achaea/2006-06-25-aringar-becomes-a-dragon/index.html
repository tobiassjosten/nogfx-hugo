Teneb, Doctor of Theoretical Planar Physics descends, resting on a golden disc of pure light.

Sarapis bows respectfully to Aringar.

The aura of divine fire about Lord Twilight begins to fluctuate and turn shadowy and luminescent. His divine aura begins to weave and shift from the deepest black to the softest shade of gray as the Dark God&#39;s mood changes.

Eris flashes Aringar a joyous smile.

Pentharian greets Aringar with a sincere smile.

Eris turns Her back on Pentharian and pointedly ignores him.

Twilight nods His head at Aringar.

Valnurana nods Her head at Aringar.

Iridia raises her hand in greeting to Aringar and says "Hello!"

Lethe flashes Aringar a joyous smile.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "For many decades, Aringar has worked, sweated, and even died to attain what some of us viewed as a nearly impossible goal."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "He is now within a hair&#39;s breadth of level 99, which no player has ever before achieved."

Twilight applauds Aringar heartily.

Demeter smiles, and the surrounding forest perks with life.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Aringar, complete your quest."

Teneb snatches the book from Aringar and begins to read. You gasp with the realization that Aringar has reached the level of Greater Dragon.

In the distance, a loud roar is heard.

Aringar, Dragon of Darkness says, "Finally. It is done."

Eris nods Her head at Aringar.

Valnurana, Goddess of Sleep and Dreams smiles softly.

Her long talons scraping against the ground, the white dragon Ashaxei lumbers into view from the northwest.

The old dragon settles down comfortably, her ancient bones creaking with age.

Ashaxei nods a greeting at the collected Gods, and sweeps her gaze over the mortal crowd.

Valnurana, Goddess of Sleep and Dreams smiles fondly at Ashaxei, and retuns the nod.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Greetings, old one."

Ashaxei settles her gaze on Aringar, and looks at him appraisingly.

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "I have watched you for some time, Aringar."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "You are...relentless."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "In ages past, before the creation of the mortal races, there were Dragons."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "Dragons of all colours, and spread across Creation."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "And in their power, these most ancient of Dragons became greedy, and grasping."

The head of this beautiful opalescent Dragon raises with pride.

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "It was I that unified the Dragons. I that brought our People together. I who turned them from mere beasts, to the masters of knowledge, and power."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "And it was I that bore Han-Tolneth to resuce the Gods themselves at Nishnatoba."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "But I am old now....frail."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "And our children grow soft, in the luxury of our home."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "We must have new blood. Outside blood. Blood that will keep our race vital."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "And so Aringar, I have chosen you to gift with the soul of a Dragon. You who have proved yourself worthy with your incredible effort."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "You now have a choice to make, great Aringar."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "Will you be a gold dragon, master of psi? Or perhaps a black dragon, whose corrosive breath is fearsome to all."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "The red holds fire in its belly, while within the silver is contained lightning, the hammer of the Skylord."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "The blue is an ice-loving being, and can summon the cold of the void, while finally, the green possesses a toxicity that even Serpentlord master would envy."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "Choose, Aringar, and rise from a lesser being to the Greater. Join us in the Parthren Gare, our home between dimensions, nestled in Yggdrasil&#39;s branches. Built for dragons and Aldar by the Gods, you will find peace there, among your peers."

Aringar, Dragon of Darkness says, "I choose to be a blue dragon."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "Blue it shall be."

Ashaxei casts a penetrating stare at Aringar, who is held spellbound in her legendary gaze.

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth exclaims, "And now Aringar, meet your fate!"

Face set with grim determination, Aringar&#39;s eyes close as a Blue light begins to shine forth, emanating from within his body.

The light grows more intense, and with a gesture of utter submission to the Dragon within, Aringar throws his arms wide and his head back as he screams, "Aaashhaaaaaaxxeeeeiiiiii!"

As a distant, triumphant roar is heard, the Blue light coalesces about Aringar. His body begins to change, and deform. His head flattens, as his neck lengthens. His body grows dramatically as wings sprout from his back, and a massive tail quickly extrudes from what are now his hindquarters.

Aringar completes his transformation and, with an ear-splitting roar, throws back his Dragon&#39;s head and screams out his triumph.

Eris, Goddess of Chaos says, "Wear My Truefavour, Aringar, for achieving a goal that holds even the Garden in awe. Your perseverance is beyond expectation."

Eris curtseys respectfully before Aringar.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Eris is correct. Even I have never seen such a feat."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Wear My truefavour also."

Pentharian nods His head at Sarapis, showing His acceptance.

Demeter, the Green Lady says, "Take the Truefavour of the Wildwood, Aringar, for your strict regiment and determination."

Aringar, Dragon of Darkness says, "Thank you, generous Gods of Sapience."

Lord Twilight Trismegistus says, "Well done, My child. You are one of My chosen, and shall be enshrouded in the glory of My favour for ten months."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "And now Aringar, let us retire to the Parthren Gare, that you may master your new form."

Ashaxei, the White Dragon of Han-Tolneth says, "The knowledge is within you. I will meet you there."

With a long, shuddering sigh, Ashaxei heaves her aging body to a stand and slowly trudges away to the northwest.

A cool, wispy finger seems to brush across the nape of your neck, leaving you momentarily drained as warmth and natural life returns to your surroundings.

Demeter scatters to the winds in a burst of leaves and flower petals, leaving the scent of fresh rain in Her wake.

Eris, Goddess of Chaos raises a hand and languidly waves, sending particles of light scampering around her.

The form of Eris, Goddess of Chaos, begins to waver and flux, finally  dispersing into a mass of rainbow colours which slowly fade.

Pentharian&#39;s body becomes translucent and then the outline of his form wavers and is filled with golden pinprickes of light. These in turn flicker briefly, then disappear.

Iridia waves goodbye.

The bluebirds sigh softly as Iridia leaves.

Valnurana flexes Her gray wings for a moment, sending a swirl of shimmering dust into the air as Her form fades into a dim glimmer and vanishes.

The fragrance of bitter incense fills the air as Lethe fades from view.

The great form of Aringar grows still and his eyes glaze over as the world blurs and then sharpens.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "And so the first of you joins the Aldar and the Dragons in the Parthren Gare."

With a flourish of His arm, Sarapis bows deeply.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "And now I will free you to act again, that you may go about your lives. But remember Aringar&#39;s triumph, and seek to follow the great path he has blazed for mortality everywhere."

Sarapis wraps Himself in His flowing grey robes, and is gone.'>Sarapis, the Logos says, "Perhaps some of you have guessed what this is about, but I think many of you have not."
Teneb, Doctor of Theoretical Planar Physics descends, resting on a golden disc of pure light.
Sarapis bows respectfully to Aringar.
The aura of divine fire about Lord Twilight begins to fluctuate and turn shadowy and luminescent. His divine aura begins to weave and shift from the deepest black to the softest shade of gray as the Dark God's mood changes.
Eris flashes Aringar a joyous smile.
Pentharian greets Aringar with a sincere smile.
Eris turns Her back on Pentharian and pointedly ignores him.
