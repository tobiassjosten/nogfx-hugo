creating an even path through the otherwise rocky soil. Upturned dirt and 
stones line the trail, churned up during countless battles along the barren 
road. Several patches of tall grass struggle to survive nearby, carving out a 
meek existence in the loose earth. Gentle breezes drift across the road 
occasionally, stirring the sparse grass. Seeker of Valour, Grandmaster Gishin

Junction in the Arena path (road).
Slabs of smooth granite have been set upon the dry ground to form a solid road,
creating an even path through the otherwise rocky soil. Upturned dirt and
stones line the trail, churned up during countless battles along the barren
road. Several patches of tall grass struggle to survive nearby, carving out a
meek existence in the loose earth. Gentle breezes drift across the road
occasionally, stirring the sparse grass. Seeker of Valour, Grandmaster Gishin

creating an even path through the otherwise rocky soil. Upturned dirt and
stones line the trail, churned up during countless battles along the barren
road. Several patches of tall grass struggle to survive nearby, carving out a
meek existence in the loose earth. Gentle breezes drift across the road
occasionally, stirring the sparse grass. Seeker of Valour, Grandmaster Gishin
