l lyradil
He is an insectoid Horkval and is covered in blackened plates of chitin.  
Several scratches and dents mark up his entire frame.  His otherwise normal 
body is accented with what could be a muscular tone.  Dark lines have sunken 
into his stern countenance.  Marred upon the center of his forehead is a 
blackened and unholy scar, remants of a Divine touch.  Hollow bug eyes boggle 
outwards from his head, glaring out into the world.  With each breath he takes 
a barely audible hiss can be heard. He is wearing a blackened medallion, a blue
cord of Wisdom, a soft belt of black silk, a pair of sturdy, war boots, a 
silver lotus blossom pin, a pair of leather, warrior's gloves, a crimson, silk 
dress shirt, a pair of semiformal black trousers, a canvas backpack, and a 
leather falconry glove. A rune shaped like a mighty oak has been sketched onto 
him. A rune resembling an elk has been sketched onto him. A rune like a lion 
has been sketched onto him.

Courtyard.
Black marble walls stand all around in this spacious courtyard. Banners hung 
from the pinnacles of towers high above proclaim the Seven Truths of Evil in 
golden lettering on black. Lower, at eye level, tapestries are hung, portraying
various scenes in the history of Evil. Here a tapestry shows the Goddess of 
dreams bound to an iron rack as the Lord of Evil tears Her eyes out. There is 
shown the stalagmite whereupon His followers spilled oceans of blood for His 
release. One shows the founding of the Naga, with Lord Sartan looking on with 
malevolent pride. Another shows the founding of the Apostates, Xerimor shown 
cutting the wings from an angel. Many more show scenes of war and duels fought 
by the Maldaathi. Again and again, the same faces show. Kaelin eviscerates a 
Mhun in one, Trunks vivisects an Atavian in another. A newly hung tapestry 
shows the Night of the Forgebreaker. Hwolf, Orchist, Kaelin, Mistral, Prophecy,
and Yig are shown each smashing a shrine to the Smith. Carved in the floor of 
the courtyard is a black pentagram, which seems to leech the light from the 
torchlit room. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground 
here. A rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground
here. A statue of a fiendish dragon shelters the courtyard with outspread 
wings. An ornate mirror stands here, its silver face reflecting cold light. A 
small, well polished metal plaque is mounted on the base of a fiendish statue. 
A pool of opaque black water has formed at the foot of the mirror in this room.
A black, murky mist has settled here. A jet-black falcon glides just above, 
looking for prey. Blade Disciple Lyradil Aristata, Squire of Belzander is here.
He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading northeast, south, northwest, and in.

Courtyard.
Black marble walls stand all around in this spacious courtyard. Banners hung 
from the pinnacles of towers high above proclaim the Seven Truths of Evil in 
golden lettering on black. Lower, at eye level, tapestries are hung, portraying
various scenes in the history of Evil. Here a tapestry shows the Goddess of 
dreams bound to an iron rack as the Lord of Evil tears Her eyes out. There is 
shown the stalagmite whereupon His followers spilled oceans of blood for His 
release. One shows the founding of the Naga, with Lord Sartan looking on with

cutting the wings from an angel. Many more show scenes of war and duels fought 
by the Maldaathi. Again and again, the same faces show. Kaelin eviscerates a 
Mhun in one, Trunks vivisects an Atavian in another. A newly hung tapestry 
shows the Night of the Forgebreaker. Hwolf, Orchist, Kaelin, Mistral, Prophecy,
and Yig are shown each smashing a shrine to the Smith. Carved in the floor of 
the courtyard is a black pentagram, which seems to leech the light from the 
torchlit room. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground 
here. A statue of a fiendish dragon shelters the courtyard with outspread 
wings. An ornate mirror stands here, its silver face reflecting cold light. A 
small, well polished metal plaque is mounted on the base of a fiendish statue. 
A pool of opaque black water has formed at the foot of the mirror in this room.
A jet-black falcon glides just above, looking for prey. Blade Disciple Lyradil 
Aristata, Squire of Belzander is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each
hand.

Courtyard.
Black marble walls stand all around in this spacious courtyard. Banners hung 
from the pinnacles of towers high above proclaim the Seven Truths of Evil in 
golden lettering on black. Lower, at eye level, tapestries are hung, portraying
various scenes in the history of Evil. Here a tapestry shows the Goddess of 
dreams bound to an iron rack as the Lord of Evil tears Her eyes out. There is 
shown the stalagmite whereupon His followers spilled oceans of blood for His 
release. One shows the founding of the Naga, with Lord Sartan looking on with 
malevolent pride. Another shows the founding of the Apostates, Xerimor shown 
cutting the wings from an angel. Many more show scenes of war and duels fought 
by the Maldaathi. Again and again, the same faces show. Kaelin eviscerates a 
Mhun in one, Trunks vivisects an Atavian in another. A newly hung tapestry 
shows the Night of the Forgebreaker. Hwolf, Orchist, Kaelin, Mistral, Prophecy,
and Yig are shown each smashing a shrine to the Smith. Carved in the floor of 
the courtyard is a black pentagram, which seems to leech the light from the 
torchlit room. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground 
here. A rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground
here. A statue of a fiendish dragon shelters the courtyard with outspread 
wings. An ornate mirror stands here, its silver face reflecting cold light. A 
small, well polished metal plaque is mounted on the base of a fiendish statue. 
A pool of opaque black water has formed at the foot of the mirror in this room.
A jet-black falcon glides just above, looking for prey. Dominatus Nitrile 
Aristata is here. Vicar Rameus de Soulis, Cruor Vinco is here. He wields a 
Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Shaitan in his left hand and an ornate

He is an insectoid Horkval and is covered in blackened plates of chitin.
Several scratches and dents mark up his entire frame. His otherwise normal
body is accented with what could be a muscular tone. Dark lines have sunken
into his stern countenance. Marred upon the center of his forehead is a
blackened and unholy scar, remants of a Divine touch. Hollow bug eyes boggle
outwards from his head, glaring out into the world. With each breath he takes
a barely audible hiss can be heard. He is wearing a blackened medallion, a blue
cord of Wisdom, a soft belt of black silk, a pair of sturdy, war boots, a
silver lotus blossom pin, a pair of leather, warrior's gloves, a crimson, silk
dress shirt, a pair of semiformal black trousers, a canvas backpack, and a
leather falconry glove. A rune shaped like a mighty oak has been sketched onto

Courtyard.
Black marble walls stand all around in this spacious courtyard. Banners hung
from the pinnacles of towers high above proclaim the Seven Truths of Evil in
golden lettering on black. Lower, at eye level, tapestries are hung, portraying
various scenes in the history of Evil. Here a tapestry shows the Goddess of
dreams bound to an iron rack as the Lord of Evil tears Her eyes out. There is
shown the stalagmite whereupon His followers spilled oceans of blood for His
release. One shows the founding of the Naga, with Lord Sartan looking on with
malevolent pride. Another shows the founding of the Apostates, Xerimor shown
cutting the wings from an angel. Many more show scenes of war and duels fought
by the Maldaathi. Again and again, the same faces show. Kaelin eviscerates a
Mhun in one, Trunks vivisects an Atavian in another. A newly hung tapestry
shows the Night of the Forgebreaker. Hwolf, Orchist, Kaelin, Mistral, Prophecy,
and Yig are shown each smashing a shrine to the Smith. Carved in the floor of
the courtyard is a black pentagram, which seems to leech the light from the
torchlit room. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground
here. A rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground

Courtyard.
Black marble walls stand all around in this spacious courtyard. Banners hung
from the pinnacles of towers high above proclaim the Seven Truths of Evil in
golden lettering on black. Lower, at eye level, tapestries are hung, portraying
various scenes in the history of Evil. Here a tapestry shows the Goddess of
dreams bound to an iron rack as the Lord of Evil tears Her eyes out. There is
shown the stalagmite whereupon His followers spilled oceans of blood for His
release. One shows the founding of the Naga, with Lord Sartan looking on with
malevolent pride. Another shows the founding of the Apostates, Xerimor shown
cutting the wings from an angel. Many more show scenes of war and duels fought
by the Maldaathi. Again and again, the same faces show. Kaelin eviscerates a
Mhun in one, Trunks vivisects an Atavian in another. A newly hung tapestry
shows the Night of the Forgebreaker. Hwolf, Orchist, Kaelin, Mistral, Prophecy,
and Yig are shown each smashing a shrine to the Smith. Carved in the floor of
the courtyard is a black pentagram, which seems to leech the light from the
torchlit room. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground
here. A statue of a fiendish dragon shelters the courtyard with outspread
wings. An ornate mirror stands here, its silver face reflecting cold light. A
small, well polished metal plaque is mounted on the base of a fiendish statue.
A pool of opaque black water has formed at the foot of the mirror in this room.
A jet-black falcon glides just above, looking for prey. Blade Disciple Lyradil
Aristata, Squire of Belzander is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each

Courtyard.
Black marble walls stand all around in this spacious courtyard. Banners hung
from the pinnacles of towers high above proclaim the Seven Truths of Evil in
golden lettering on black. Lower, at eye level, tapestries are hung, portraying
various scenes in the history of Evil. Here a tapestry shows the Goddess of
dreams bound to an iron rack as the Lord of Evil tears Her eyes out. There is
shown the stalagmite whereupon His followers spilled oceans of blood for His
release. One shows the founding of the Naga, with Lord Sartan looking on with
malevolent pride. Another shows the founding of the Apostates, Xerimor shown
cutting the wings from an angel. Many more show scenes of war and duels fought
by the Maldaathi. Again and again, the same faces show. Kaelin eviscerates a
Mhun in one, Trunks vivisects an Atavian in another. A newly hung tapestry
shows the Night of the Forgebreaker. Hwolf, Orchist, Kaelin, Mistral, Prophecy,
and Yig are shown each smashing a shrine to the Smith. Carved in the floor of
the courtyard is a black pentagram, which seems to leech the light from the
torchlit room. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground
here. A rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground
here. A statue of a fiendish dragon shelters the courtyard with outspread
wings. An ornate mirror stands here, its silver face reflecting cold light. A
small, well polished metal plaque is mounted on the base of a fiendish statue.
A pool of opaque black water has formed at the foot of the mirror in this room.
A jet-black falcon glides just above, looking for prey. Dominatus Nitrile
