Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying hypnotically. Blade

A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying hypnotically. A mottled

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying hypnotically. A mottled
Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. There are 2 large walls of
stone here. Blade Aspirant Jarrel Demonhammer, Ward of Mhaldor is here, sprawled
on the floor. He wields a Soulpiercer in each hand.

bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A 
rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here.

A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A 
rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. A 
mottled Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. There are 2 large 
walls of stone here. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying 
hypnotically. Blade Aspirant Jarrel Demonhammer, Ward of Mhaldor is riding on 
Iazgua, the giant cobra. He wields a Soulpiercer in each hand.

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A 
mottled Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. There are 2 large 
walls of stone here. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying 
hypnotically. Blade Aspirant Jarrel Demonhammer, Ward of Mhaldor is here, 
sprawled on the floor. He wields a Soulpiercer in each hand.

never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A 
mottled Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. There are 2 large 
walls of stone here. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying

A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the 
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping 
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and 
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense 
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool 
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A 
mottled Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. There are 2 large

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool
shade. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying hypnotically. Blade

A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool
shade. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying hypnotically. A mottled

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool
shade. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying hypnotically. A mottled
Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. There are 2 large walls of

A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping

never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A

Centre of Gaian forest. (Gaian Forest)
A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A

A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A

A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A

A colossal oak tree rises into the firmament, dwarfing its fellow oaks and the
hazel trees that surround it. Green vines snake up the massive trunk, wrapping
around the oak in an attempt to reach the branches high above. Dead leaves and
bracken cover the earth, decomposing slowly and feeding the smaller foliage in a
never-ending cycle of life and death. Little light can pass through the dense
blanket of leaves overhead, and the forest floor is perpetually cast in a cool
shade. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A
mottled Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. There are 2 large
walls of stone here. Iazgua, the giant cobra is here, her head swaying
hypnotically. Blade Aspirant Jarrel Demonhammer, Ward of Mhaldor is here,
sprawled on the floor. He wields a Soulpiercer in each hand.
