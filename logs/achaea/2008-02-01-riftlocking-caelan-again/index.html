A large handaxe comes flying into the room, arcs toward you, and carries you away with it!
Above the clouds over central Sapience.
A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering 
on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses 
his regal head impatiently. Diamoirite, the Godar stands here, fiercely ominous. A grumpy badger 
stands here, snuffling about angrily. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your 
feet. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the 
eye. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and 
down.
Your movement causes your magical shield to dissipate.
You spring a trap!! A loop of rope entwines around you, pulling you off your feet and looping around
your neck.

Above the clouds over central Sapience.
A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering

stands here, snuffling about angrily. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your
feet. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the
