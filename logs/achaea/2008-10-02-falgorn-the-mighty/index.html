Amidst the lake. (Lake Vundamere)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A kelp plant waves in the currents. 
Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some 
movement in the distance. Its fins above the surface, a large carp swims here. 
The Red Dragon Chidori's imposing form looms. Falgorn is here. He wields a 
puppet roughly resembling Skye in his left hand and a banded shield in his 
right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, southwest, and west.

Amidst the lake. (Lake Vundamere)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. You find yourself in the middle of the
beautiful Lake Vundamere. The crystal clear blue water surrounds you and a 
little breeze brings a fresh smell. Fish in different sizes swim quickly away as
they notice your presence and occasionally the fins of a carp make the water 
ripple. The plains of the savannah can be seen all around the lake and in the 
middle you can make out a small island with a little hut on it. A kelp plant 
waves in the currents. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its 
fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Its fins above the surface, a

beautiful Lake Vundamere. The crystal clear blue water surrounds you and a

they notice your presence and occasionally the fins of a carp make the water 
ripple. The plains of the savannah can be seen all around the lake and in the 
middle you can make out a small island with a little hut on it. A kelp plant 
waves in the currents. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its 
fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Its fins above the surface, a 
large carp swims here. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this

Amidst the lake. (Lake Vundamere)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. You find yourself in the middle of the
beautiful Lake Vundamere. The crystal clear blue water surrounds you and a 
little breeze brings a fresh smell. Fish in different sizes swim quickly away as
they notice your presence and occasionally the fins of a carp make the water 
ripple. The plains of the savannah can be seen all around the lake and in the 
middle you can make out a small island with a little hut on it. A kelp plant 
waves in the currents. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its 
fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Eyes flickering briefly from 
out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its 
master's side. The Red Dragon Chidori's imposing form looms. Tali Ka'Tal is 
here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand. Falgorn is 
here. He wields a banded shield in his right hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, southwest, and west.

Amidst the lake. (Lake Vundamere)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. You find yourself in the middle of the
beautiful Lake Vundamere. The crystal clear blue water surrounds you and a
little breeze brings a fresh smell. Fish in different sizes swim quickly away as
they notice your presence and occasionally the fins of a carp make the water
ripple. The plains of the savannah can be seen all around the lake and in the
middle you can make out a small island with a little hut on it. A kelp plant
waves in the currents. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its
fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Its fins above the surface, a
large carp swims here. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this
daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. The Red
Dragon Chidori's imposing form looms. Falgorn is here. He wields a banded shield
in his right hand. Tali Ka'Tal is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of

Amidst the lake. (Lake Vundamere)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. You find yourself in the middle of the
beautiful Lake Vundamere. The crystal clear blue water surrounds you and a
little breeze brings a fresh smell. Fish in different sizes swim quickly away as
they notice your presence and occasionally the fins of a carp make the water
ripple. The plains of the savannah can be seen all around the lake and in the
middle you can make out a small island with a little hut on it. A kelp plant
waves in the currents. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its
fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Eyes flickering briefly from
out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its
master's side. The Red Dragon Chidori's imposing form looms. Tali Ka'Tal is
here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand. Falgorn is
here. He wields a banded shield in his right hand.
