The world before your eyes ripples and shifts as Daedalus, Guardian of Balance steps through an unseen doorway.

With a flourish of His arm, Daedalus bows deeply.

"Greetings!" Daedalus says with a smile.

The fire of revenge kindles in your heart as Keresis, Goddess of Vengeance  materializes before you.

With a hiss of fire and a burst of flames, Pytho, the Flame Serpent slithers in from the ether.

A tiny, hovering point of light bursts into a pulsating sphere from within which Ourania, Goddess of the Moon emerges.

The sound of rumbling laughter and the ringing of jewellery announces the  arrival of Prospero, God of Trade and Wealth.

The crescendo of battle rises then fades abruptly as Matsuhama materializes  before you.

The shouts of a victorious army thunders proudly, the sound diminishing as the form of Aegis appears.

A lupine howl cuts through the air like a knife, announcing the arrival of Lupus, Wild God of the Beasts.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "I&#39;ve re-enabled movement for a brief period. If you need to move north and cure yourself of anything, please do so now."

You see Daedalus, Guardian of Balance shout, "The next mortal to fill my screen unnecessarily gets to watch the ceremony from the Halls of Sarapis."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Very well."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "If you have not healed yourself of blindness or whatever else by this time, it&#39;s too late."

Daedalus wipes the back of His hand across His head in relief as He mutters, "Whew."

Daedalus, Guardian of Balance says, "We should keep mortals paralyzed like this more frequently. It&#39;s much tidier."

Sarapis nods His head at Daedalus.

Keresis chuckles long and heartily.

Keresis, Goddess of Vengeance says, "Indeed."

** The ceremony shall now commence! **

Sarapis, the Logos says, "As it is written in the Mythos: Past legend and lore, before memory and myth, I as Ayar willed into existence everything known and unknown."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "After the passage of countless millennia, a singular desire rose within Me. Wishing to experience Creation firsthand, I split Myself in two: Ayar and Proteus."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Following the great War of Humanity and the Chaos Wars, Ayar and Proteus became One once more to ensure the survival of Creation itself. I stand before you as that One."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "...still more countless millennia have passed , and I have witnessed it all from My throne."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "I have gathered you here before Me to deliver this pronouncement: Once again, I have found a desire growing deep within Me -- for a profound change unlike any before."

A crimson form streaks through the firmament, banking and wheeling in the clouds high overhead.

The flying figure arcs and dives straight down towards the Shrine of Ascension like an arrow shot from a crossbow, becoming recognisable as the dragon Yudhishthira. He bellows a thunderous roar as he descends, flames wreathing his frame.

A soft breeze stirs around you as Miramar, Goddess of Justice, steps forth from a radiant beam of silver light.

As the red dragon draws nearer, a dark figure can be seen seated astride his massive back, seemingly untouched by the fire that surrounds Yudhishthira.

Shimmering waves of heat cascade down to the Shrine of Ascension as the dragon&#39;s descent nears its nadir.

At the last possible moment to avoid a fiery collision with the earth, the dragon spreads his leathery wings and slows, landing atop the Shrine of Ascension with a stately grace belied by his enormous form.

The dragon Yudhishthira unleashes a second earth-shaking roar before slinking down low upon his belly, allowing the dragonrider to dismount with a nimble leap. The flames wreathing the dragon subside to a smoulder.

Raksha Makali, the Destroyer, utters a single word to Yudhishthira. Inclining his head in acquiescence, the dragon spreads his wings once more and launches into the air, soon vanishing from sight.

Raksha Makali, the Destroyer says, "Hail, Logos!"

Makali, Goddess of Destruction, steps down from the Shrine of Ascension and strides towards Sarapis, the Logos in three swift, sure steps. She drops to one knee, kneeling with Her head bowed low.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Rise, O Goddess."

The Destroyer rises fluidly to Her feet.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "It is claimed by some that you represent Mine opposite: Destruction where I am Creation."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "In this they believe falsely."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Forsooth, I exist beyond such simplistic dichotomies, beyond the Veil that shrouds the immanent essence of reality."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "I exist at the heart of that essence; I am its very consciousness. The Gods of the Pantheon spring forth from that heart. Whatever the individual circumstances of each God&#39;s birth, the true source of each God&#39;s divinity lies within that core -- within ME."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "On this epochal day, I, Sarapis, desire to relinquish My place at this source and pass on the torch of overseership of Creation to another."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "But this torch shall not pass to You, Goddess of Destruction."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "As is the case with all Gods aside from Myself and perhaps Daedalus -- indeed, with all beings -- an imbalance exists within you that would endanger Creation were you to take My place."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Now, historians amongst those gathered may know that at the end of the Chaos Wars, I raised the Aldar named Maya to Godhood."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Though tragic and terrible, the rape of Maya that begat humanity transformed the very essence of Maya in mysterious ways. As the first divine Mother, touched by the unpredictable hand of Chaos, She possessed great creative powers only one such as I could begin to fathom."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Long ago, She fell into a deep slumber, concealing Herself from mortalkind. The place of Her rest is here, beneath this very shrine."

Sarapis pauses, gathering a deep breath.

Matsuhama appears out of thin air.

The fire of revenge kindles in your heart as Keresis, Goddess of Vengeance materializes before you.

A tiny, hovering point of light bursts into a pulsating sphere from within which Ourania, Goddess of the Moon emerges.

Someone powerful says, "We shall continue momentarily."

Sarapis appears out of thin air.

Lupus appears out of thin air.

Daedalus wipes the back of His hand across His head in relief as He mutters, "Whew."

Prospero appears out of thin air.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Long ago, the goddess Maya fell into a deep slumber, concealing Herself from mortalkind. The place of Her rest is here, beneath this very shrine."

Sarapis takes a deep breath.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "RISE, O GODDESS!"

Slowly.. dreamily... a delicate white mist drifts upwards from the ground beneath the Shrine of Ascension.

The lacy tendrils of mist wend and wind together, knitting tighter and tighter into the form of a pale woman swathed in white, standing next to the dark form of the Goddess of Destruction.

Sarapis nods in acknowledgement of the ancient Goddess.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Fecund in creative power though You are, Maya, there exists imbalance in You also."

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Hence to bring both of you into the necessary balance, I must merge together the two Goddesses who stand before Me, just as once the divine essences of Proteus and Ayar merged to form Myself."

With simultaneous nods, the two Goddesses turn to face each other: one of white mist, the other black as night. Their movements exactly mirrored by the other, They each step forward so that they stand a mere few inches apart.

Then with another step, so fluidly it seems like a trick of the light, an optical illusion--they stride forwards once more. Reality flickers for a brief instant, the scene before you suddenly distorting, shapes and colours around you fluctuating and bleeding into one another. In that instant, you see the two Goddesses as still two separate beings, yet somehow, impossibly, occupying the exact same spatio-temporal location.

Solarus arrives from the north.

The sound of dozens of distant, muffled implosions echo throughout the realm asin Her final act, Raksha Makali, the Destroyer, obliterates Her shrines from existence, absorbing their energies.

Reality flickers once more, and you see that where were two are now One, the two having stepped through and into each other, leaving only a single figure behind.

A brilliant glow begins to emanate from Sarapis, the Logos, faint at first but growing brighter and brighter until a blazing corona of light surrounds Him. The Logos reaches towards the figure and clasps His hands upon Her shoulders, and Her outline begins to glow radiantly as well.

The more the light grows around the Goddess, the more it fades from the Logos... until finally it surrounds Him no more.

Sarapis, the Logos releases the shoulders of Maya, the Great Mother.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "It is done."

Sarapis, the Logos slumps slightly. A faint look of weariness flickers over His face, then is gone, replaced by the same impassive, ageless countenance as it has ever held.

Someone powerful says, "It is done."

Maya appears out of thin air.

Maya, the Great Mother, lifts Her arms heavenwards.

The ground rumbles and quakes contentiously, then acquiescing to Her wishes, begins to elevate rapidly beneath your feet!

Dust swirls around you, obscuring all vision and making you choke.

When the dust settles, you glance around to find that the Shrine of Ascension now rests upon a mountain peak higher than any other in the Siroccian range. Glancing down to the southwest, one can see the tops of the peaks of Mount Sinope and Mount Callisto, named for the twin children of Maya.

You feel an increase in your neocredits!

Aegis kneels before Maya, swearing His allegiance to Maya.

Tarah appears out of thin air.

Lupus kneels before Maya, swearing His allegiance to Maya.

Tarah kneels before Maya, swearing Her allegiance to Maya.

Keresis kneels before Maya, swearing Her allegiance to Maya.

Prospero kneels before Maya, swearing His allegiance to Maya.

Matsuhama kneels before Maya, swearing His allegiance to Maya.

Miramar stands up and stretches Her arms out wide.

Aegis stands up and stretches His arms out wide.

Keresis stands up and stretches Her arms out wide.

Prospero stands up and stretches His arms out wide.

Matsuhama stands up and stretches His arms out wide.

Tarah stands up and stretches Her arms out wide.

Lupus stands up and stretches His arms out wide.

Aegis steps forward.

Aegis, God of War says, "I bow before you, my General, and present to you a sword crafted within my personal forge."

Ourania stands up and stretches Her arms out wide.

Daedalus, Guardian of Balance says, "I have some pink painted fingernails, and a delicate piece of vanilla cake?"

Aegis gives a runed scabbard to Maya, the Great Mother.

Aegis, God of War says, "The blade is granted to all leaders, and is a reminderto lead with both prudence and force in eternal balance."

Aegis, God of War says, "May the future exploits of my realm bring entertainment to your immortal soul, m&#39;lady."

Aegis bows respectfully to Maya.

Aegis steps back.

Keresis steps forward.

Keresis, Goddess of Vengeance says, "Once Sister, now Mother. My gift to You is personal, a living memory of the rule of Destruction."

The Goddess of Vengeance gathers Pytho, the Flame Serpent in Her hand. Focusing Her intense stare upon the flame serpent, She purses Her lips and blows a quick breath through it, threatening to extinguish it. Instead, a small spark dislodges from Pytho and begins to float in the air.

With a look of satisfaction shadowing Her icy features, Keresis, Goddess of Vengeance begins to manipulate the flame, stretching it lengthwise into a vaguely snake-like form which begins to slither on its own. As Her touch moves away, the flame burns white-hot.

Keresis, Goddess of Vengeance says, "May Pytho&#39;s progeny aide You in Weaving Your Illusions, Maya, Mother of Creation."

Keresis gives a white flame serpent to Maya, the Great Mother.

Keresis steps back.

Miramar picks up the Golden Mean.

Prospero, the Merchant Lord says, "I swear to you My allegiance, dear Lady."

Prospero, the Merchant Lord says, "Please, take this Ring of Trade as a guide in good fortune."

Prospero gives the Ring of Trade to Maya, the Great Mother.

Prospero performs a graceful curtsey.

Daedalus steps forward.

Daedalus, Guardian of Balance says, "I present you with my Scales of Balance, an instrument that has served me for centuries."

Daedalus, Guardian of Balance says, "Use them well, Great Mother."

Daedalus gives the Scales of Balance to Maya, the Great Mother.

Accompanied by the sharp resonance of ringing metal, Ourania produces a long, bladed weapon from within robes woven from moonbeams and kneels before Maya, offering Her the blade hilt-first.

Ourania, Goddess of the Moon says, "May the veil of illusion that distracts and disorients, through Your magnificent creativeness and complexity be rendered by the into naught more than a mesh through which all might perceive the ultimate reality of existence."

Matsuhama steps forward.

Lupus kneels before the Great Mother Maya.

Lupus, Wild God of the Beasts says, "Great Mother I would bestow upon You one of My greatest treasures. That of the Pelt of a great Nevaharr collected during the great Hunts of far off realms."

Lupus gives The Golden pelt of the Nevaharr to Maya, the Great Mother.

Matsuhama, the Eternal Warrior says, "M&#39;lady, I offer you my loyalty and this simple brooch. Though bland, and simple to the visible eye, it is a powerful ward of protection and worthy of only one such as yourself."

Matsuhama gives a onyx brooch to Maya, the Great Mother.

Matsuhama, the Eternal Warrior says to Lupus, "Quite impatient for a supposed "Hunter"."

Matsuhama grumbles angrily.

Tarah whispers soothing words to Matsuhama.

Matsuhama steps back.

Tarah steps forward.

Tarah places Her hands upon Her chest. In a moment, Her hands glow with amber light.

Tarah&#39;s hands move forward and turn palm up, withdrawing from Herself a globe of amber power.

Lady of Vundamere, Tarah Concordia says, "I lack a tangible gift, but I give of Myself to You. I give You some of My compassion, that You may always return it upon Creation."

Tarah gives an amber globe of essence to Maya, the Great Mother.

Tarah steps back.

Tarah kneels before Maya, swearing Her allegiance to Maya.

Miramar steps forward.

Tarah stands up and stretches Her arms out wide.

Miramar, Goddess of Justice says, "For You are enduring and forever, I give to You, Great Mother, this Shield crafted by My hand. May it be representative of Your never-ending Creativity and Power that is like a shield that protects and contains these Lands."

Miramar gives the Imperishable Shield to Maya, the Great Mother.

Miramar kneels before Maya, swearing Her allegiance to Maya.

Miramar stands up and stretches Her arms out wide.

Miramar steps back.

White light engulfs Ourania, Goddess of the Moon, dwindling into a small radiant point and vanishing.

A tiny, hovering point of light bursts into a pulsating sphere from within which Ourania, Goddess of the Moon emerges.

Maya, the Great Mother says, "I am honoured beyond all bounds by the gifts I have been given today -- not least of all the tacit honour given to Me by all who have attended to witness My creation and ascension, mortals and Divine alike. Thank you."

Maya, the Great Mother says, "The ceremony ends here, and a new epoch begins under My auspices. May it be a great one."

Maya draws Her veil tighter across Her face, Her form shimmering and becoming translucent.

Maya, the Great Mother says, "I believe you mortals have CTF preparations to make!"'>Sarapis, the Logos says, "If you need to heal yourself of afflictions or take care of anything else, please go north and handle it there."
The world before your eyes ripples and shifts as Daedalus, Guardian of Balance steps through an unseen doorway.
With a flourish of His arm, Daedalus bows deeply.
"Greetings!" Daedalus says with a smile.
The fire of revenge kindles in your heart as Keresis, Goddess of Vengeance materializes before you.
With a hiss of fire and a burst of flames, Pytho, the Flame Serpent slithers in from the ether.

Sarapis, the Logos says, "Very well."

Daedalus wipes the back of His hand across His head in relief as He mutters, "Whew."
Daedalus, Guardian of Balance says, "We should keep mortals paralyzed like this more frequently. It's much tidier."
Sarapis nods His head at Daedalus.
Keresis chuckles long and heartily.
Keresis, Goddess of Vengeance says, "Indeed."
** The ceremony shall now commence! **
Sarapis, the Logos says, "As it is written in the Mythos: Past legend and lore, before memory and myth, I as Ayar willed into existence everything known and unknown."
