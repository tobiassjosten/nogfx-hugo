High above the clouds.
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull 
is standing here, motionless. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has 
settled here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. 
Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone 
push up from the ground.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

Nearing Lake Vundamere (road).
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A small wooden sign is nailed crookedly to a 
post here. A canvas backpack lies face-down here. A mottled Mhojave desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro.
