Forest in the shadow of the cliffs.
Towering pine and fir trees block the sky from view and tiny saplings poke their 
heads out from beneath a blanket of pine needles. Now and then you see a squirrel 
skitter quickly through the undergrowth at the edge of your vision, searching for 
nuts and berries to satisfy its hunger and then disappearing within the shelter of 
the fallen log, which dominates the grove. Tiny insects scurry in about tiny holes 
bored into the decaying wood and fungi grows thick on its sides. You can hear the 
faint sound of running water quite near at hand, but the sheer mountain slope rising 
sharply to the west blocks any possible view of its source. Spreading its majestic 
golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A noble 
snow-white falcon glides to and fro here. A scorching wall of fire stands here. Spire
Hayabusa is here.
You see exits leading north, east, and southwest.

You must regain equilibrium first.
3500h, 3685m, 16216e, 15418w cxkdb-

A fertile grove.

3500h, 3685m, 16236e, 15424w cxkdb-

Forest in the shadow of the cliffs.
Towering pine and fir trees block the sky from view and tiny saplings poke their 
heads out from beneath a blanket of pine needles. Now and then you see a squirrel 
skitter quickly through the undergrowth at the edge of your vision, searching for 
nuts and berries to satisfy its hunger and then disappearing within the shelter of 
the fallen log, which dominates the grove. Tiny insects scurry in about tiny holes 
bored into the decaying wood and fungi grows thick on its sides. You can hear the 
faint sound of running water quite near at hand, but the sheer mountain slope rising 
sharply to the west blocks any possible view of its source. Spreading its majestic 
golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A noble 
snow-white falcon glides to and fro here. There are 3 scorching walls of fire here.

bored into the decaying wood and fungi grows thick on its sides. You can hear the 
faint sound of running water quite near at hand, but the sheer mountain slope rising 
sharply to the west blocks any possible view of its source. Spreading its majestic 
golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A noble

nuts and berries to satisfy its hunger and then disappearing within the shelter of 
the fallen log, which dominates the grove. Tiny insects scurry in about tiny holes 
bored into the decaying wood and fungi grows thick on its sides. You can hear the 
faint sound of running water quite near at hand, but the sheer mountain slope rising 
sharply to the west blocks any possible view of its source. There are 3 scorching 
walls of fire here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the 
ground with piercing eyes. A noble snow-white falcon glides to and fro here. Spire

Forest in the shadow of the cliffs.
Towering pine and fir trees block the sky from view and tiny saplings poke their
heads out from beneath a blanket of pine needles. Now and then you see a squirrel
skitter quickly through the undergrowth at the edge of your vision, searching for
nuts and berries to satisfy its hunger and then disappearing within the shelter of
the fallen log, which dominates the grove. Tiny insects scurry in about tiny holes
bored into the decaying wood and fungi grows thick on its sides. You can hear the
faint sound of running water quite near at hand, but the sheer mountain slope rising
sharply to the west blocks any possible view of its source. Spreading its majestic
golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A noble
snow-white falcon glides to and fro here. There are 3 scorching walls of fire here.
Spire Hayabusa is here.

Forest in the shadow of the cliffs.
Towering pine and fir trees block the sky from view and tiny saplings poke their
heads out from beneath a blanket of pine needles. Now and then you see a squirrel
skitter quickly through the undergrowth at the edge of your vision, searching for
nuts and berries to satisfy its hunger and then disappearing within the shelter of
the fallen log, which dominates the grove. Tiny insects scurry in about tiny holes
bored into the decaying wood and fungi grows thick on its sides. You can hear the
faint sound of running water quite near at hand, but the sheer mountain slope rising
sharply to the west blocks any possible view of its source. There are 3 scorching
walls of fire here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the
ground with piercing eyes. A noble snow-white falcon glides to and fro here. Spire
Hayabusa is here.
You see exits leading north, east, and southwest.
