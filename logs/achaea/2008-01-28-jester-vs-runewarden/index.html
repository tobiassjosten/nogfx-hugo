is 
moist and partially frozen providing a precarious mixture of slippery wet rock
and 
mud. The roar of water echoes off the rock walls leaving one unable to discern
the 
direction of the thundering noise. E'thernal, the black crystalline crocodile is 
here, his pearlescent blue eyes sparkling menacingly. A noble hippogriff flaps
its 
wings in agitation here. A striking grey falcon of the salt marsh perches
nearby. 
Senator Gnaash Bora'k, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an ornate steel
rapier 
in each hand.

Rocky path.
The path is barely a narrow crevice between two large rock formations that reach
to 
the sky above. Several scraps of worn and dingy cloth hang from a jutting,
jagged 
piece of granite, obviously torn from the previous owner as the rock attempted
to 
entrap them. In another section of the crevice, tufts of fur have been left
behind. A
rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. A
rune 
like a rising sun has been sketched into the ground here. A striking grey falcon
of 
the salt marsh perches nearby. E'thernal, the black crystalline crocodile is
here, 
his pearlescent blue eyes sparkling menacingly. A noble hippogriff flaps its
wings in
agitation here. Senator Gnaash Bora'k, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an 
ornate steel rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading northwest and down.

Rocky path.
The path is barely a narrow crevice between two large rock formations that reach
to 
the sky above. Several scraps of worn and dingy cloth hang from a jutting,
jagged 
piece of granite, obviously torn from the previous owner as the rock attempted
to 
entrap them. In another section of the crevice, tufts of fur have been left
behind. A
rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. A
rune 
like a rising sun has been sketched into the ground here. A striking grey falcon
of 
the salt marsh perches nearby. E'thernal, the black crystalline crocodile is
here, 
his pearlescent blue eyes sparkling menacingly. A noble hippogriff flaps its
wings in
agitation here. Senator Gnaash Bora'k, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an 
ornate steel rapier in each hand.

Rocky path.
The path is barely a narrow crevice between two large rock formations that reach
to
the sky above. Several scraps of worn and dingy cloth hang from a jutting,
jagged
piece of granite, obviously torn from the previous owner as the rock attempted
to
entrap them. In another section of the crevice, tufts of fur have been left
behind. A
rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. A
rune
like a rising sun has been sketched into the ground here. A striking grey falcon
of
the salt marsh perches nearby. E'thernal, the black crystalline crocodile is
here,
his pearlescent blue eyes sparkling menacingly. A noble hippogriff flaps its
wings in
agitation here. Senator Gnaash Bora'k, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an
ornate steel rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading northwest and down.

Rocky path.
The path is barely a narrow crevice between two large rock formations that reach
to
the sky above. Several scraps of worn and dingy cloth hang from a jutting,
jagged
piece of granite, obviously torn from the previous owner as the rock attempted
to
entrap them. In another section of the crevice, tufts of fur have been left
behind. A
rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. A
rune
like a rising sun has been sketched into the ground here. A striking grey falcon
of
the salt marsh perches nearby. E'thernal, the black crystalline crocodile is
here,
his pearlescent blue eyes sparkling menacingly. A noble hippogriff flaps its
wings in
agitation here. Senator Gnaash Bora'k, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an
ornate steel rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading northwest and down.

You set the jack-in-the-box on the ground and quickly wind it with its handle
