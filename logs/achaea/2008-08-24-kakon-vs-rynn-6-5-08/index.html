the streets of Cyrene below, whilst providing stunning panoramic views of the city 
and its surrounding terrain. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the 
ground for food. There are 3 large walls of ice here. Rynn Etienne, Otoji of the Body

south of the city, Lake Muurn ripples softly, the light shimmering off its calm 
waters, each twinkle resembling the birth and death of a star. An icewall is here, 
blocking passage to the east. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the

Dotted clouds overlooking a city.
Resembling a haze, the intermingling clouds bunch together, the reflecting light 
causing them to glow with a soft hue that in turn lights up the sky. The intensity of
the colours blanket Cyrene with a shadow of soft peach which increases the beauty of 
the city, illuminating the Garden of The Arts and the statues it holds within. To the
south of the city, Lake Muurn ripples softly, the light shimmering off its calm 
waters, each twinkle resembling the birth and death of a star. An icewall is here, 
blocking passage to the east. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the
ground for food. Rynn Etienne, Otoji of the Body is here.

Dotted clouds overlooking a city.
Resembling a haze, the intermingling clouds bunch together, the reflecting light 
causing them to glow with a soft hue that in turn lights up the sky. The intensity of
the colours blanket Cyrene with a shadow of soft peach which increases the beauty of 
the city, illuminating the Garden of The Arts and the statues it holds within. To the
south of the city, Lake Muurn ripples softly, the light shimmering off its calm 
waters, each twinkle resembling the birth and death of a star. An icewall is here, 
blocking passage to the east. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the
ground for food. Rynn Etienne, Otoji of the Body is here.

Upon the gold speckled roof of the Pantheon.
The surface of the pantheon is of an octahedral shape, each side slanted sharply 
making walking rather difficult. The material is a form of blue slating, speckled 
with golden flakes that are ingrained onto the surface. In places the slates bear 
tiny arcane inscriptions. At the very edge of the roofing there is a sheer drop to 
the streets of Cyrene below, whilst providing stunning panoramic views of the city 
and its surrounding terrain. There are 2 large walls of ice here. Rynn Etienne, Otoji

ground for food. There are 3 large walls of ice here. Rynn Etienne, Otoji of the Body

causing them to glow with a soft hue that in turn lights up the sky. The intensity of
the colours blanket Cyrene with a shadow of soft peach which increases the beauty of
the city, illuminating the Garden of The Arts and the statues it holds within. To the

the streets of Cyrene below, whilst providing stunning panoramic views of the city
and its surrounding terrain. There are 2 large walls of ice here. Rynn Etienne, Otoji

tiny arcane inscriptions. At the very edge of the roofing there is a sheer drop to
the streets of Cyrene below, whilst providing stunning panoramic views of the city
and its surrounding terrain. There are 2 large walls of ice here. Rynn Etienne, Otoji

waters, each twinkle resembling the birth and death of a star. An icewall is here,
