You command your Baalzadeen to tear the soul from Osek Ironside. Faster than the eye can follow, its blood-red hands 
shoot out and quickly burrow into the chest of Osek Ironside who begins screaming as his body bucks and convulses from 
the massive shock. Peeling back its lips to reveal its maw, the Baalzadeen roars in triumph and rips its powerful arms 
backwards, dragging an ephemeral, spiderweb substance with it: Osek Ironside&#39;s soul.
You have slain Osek.
A starburst tattoo flares and bathes Osek in red light.

backwards, dragging an ephemeral, spiderweb substance with it: Osek Ironside's soul.
You have slain Osek.
A starburst tattoo flares and bathes Osek in red light.
