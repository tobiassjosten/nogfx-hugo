The radiant sun shines all about you.


Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "I have urgent business that needs 
tending to by those that be present."

Kakotas says with a slightly dwarven accent, "The House calls forth Lady 
Trenia."

Trenia steps to the front of the room and turns to address those present.

Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "My fellow Knights, I beg a boon."

Motioning those around him to grant some space Draekar steps forward gazing into
the pool briefly before turning to face the gathered crowd.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says commandingly, "Ask, and if it 
be within our power and a proper thing, it shall be yours."

Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "I wish the accolade of Knighthood be
bestowed upon these fine men, Justiciars Synbios and Runei."

Pausing for a second in contemplation Draekar bows his head momentarily before 
lifting it again in a glance across the gathered crowd.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says commandingly, "What say you 
Brethren Knights? Is it your judgment that Justiciar Synbios and Justiciar Runei
are worthy to be numbered among us in prowess, loyalty, and courtesy?"

Kakotas says with a slightly dwarven accent, "Aye."


Sir Varick, Wielder of the Sword of Judgement says, "Aye."

With an air of confidence, Talarna marches in from the ether.

Talarna raises her voice and proclaims, "Aye!".

Draekar smiles encouragingly and nods.

Kruellagh&#39;s face brightens visibly with a broad grin.

Trenia&#39;s mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says commandingly, "Call forth the 
Candidates."

Kakotas says with a slightly dwarven accent, "Justiciars Runei and Synbios, come
forth and kneel."

Runei kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.


You have tmoted: Synbios raises his head, a stern look on his face, before 
stepping forward.

You drop to one knee, demonstrating your humility and respect.

Trenia turns to Justiciars Runei and Synbios.

Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "My proteges, from the time that you 
have chosen the Path of the Templars, I have attempted to teach you what you 
need to journey upon this Path. I have shown you the ways of prowess, courtesy, 
devotion, chivalry, honour, and piety. In return, you have shown me that not 
only have you understood these concepts, but that you have mastered them in your
own special way."

Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "Our relationship does not end now, 
it only changes. Instead of calling you a Squire, I can also call you my 
Brother."

Draekar inclines his head in acknowledgement of Lady Trenia, before turning to 
face Synbios and Runei.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Right mindful of your prowess
in the field, your exemplary soul, and responsive to the wishes of your peers, 
we are minded to make you both Knights this day."

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Know that to wear the regalia
of a Templar is to hold a sacred trust and know that the obligations of 
Knighthood will demand your best efforts every moment of your life."

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "A Knight of the Holy Church 
must respect all Deities and their Orders, never offending the Faith of another,
yet knowing that our reverence is reserved for those Deities who represent 
Goodness, Light, Righteousness, Valour, Compassion, Wisdom, Justice, and other 
such qualities that the Church deems worthy."

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "A Knight must respect all 
those who are weak or defenseless, whether because of age, infirmity, poverty or
vow, and be steadfast in defending them."

Runei kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "As a Knight you must ever 
keep your word true and free of deception. You must tolerate no harm to the 
innocent, keep true to the tenets of Knighthood as you will swear to hereafter, 
and hold true to the laws of the Holy Church which you have already each been 
made aware of."


Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "The laws of the House require
that a Knight be prow, as you have demonstrated on the field of battle, holy as 
shown by the pureness of your soul, courteous as you have always presented 
yourself to be and as these noble Templars attest, and loyal to the House and 
the Holy Church of Achaea as we do know each of you to be."

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Do each of you understand and
accept this?"

Runei says in a thick, gravelly voice, "Aye Sir, I do."

You have tmoted: Synbios lowers his head for a moment, then utters a quiet, "Aye
Sir."

You drop to one knee, demonstrating your humility and respect.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Do both of you then desire to
accept the burden of Knighthood and swear fealty to the Holy Church and the 
House?"

Runei says in a thick, gravelly voice, "Yes Sir."

You say in a dry, cynical voice, "If the growth of Creation is the goal, then I 
gladly accept the burden."

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Now then you shall swear 
fealty to the Holy Church and to the House."

Draekar nods his head at Kakotas.

Trenia gives midnight black leather boots adorned with gold spurs to Runei.

Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "The spur is not only a tool used for
urging on your steed in battle. It is a sign and a symbol of Knighthood. 
Remember always that though possess that power to force people to obey, it is 
the true sign of respect to have those that you would force instead to follow 
willingly in what you ask."


Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "Remember, it is not the spurs or the
title that make the Knight, but it is the Knight who gives meaning to the 
symbols and the title that are bestowed."

Draekar nods his head at Trenia.

Talarna carefully removes several garments from a dragonskin pack, unfolds them 
and presents them to Draekar.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "The Spurs are indeed an 
important symbol of your Knighthood, but if they were all you wore then you 
might find yourselves very under-dressed."

Kruellagh&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

enough to be worn over a suit of armour. It is fully open down each side and

Ferrous."

you in turn."

Kruellagh moves his huge bulk to the north with surprising grace.

Ferrous says in a reflective, hushed voice, "I have waited many years for this 
moment, and am so proud of you today!"

Mephaos sighs and slumps slightly.

Mephaos lowers his head and mumbles to himself.

Ferrous says in a reflective, hushed voice, "I remember us as youngsters, 
hunting, exploring and completing our house tasks together.... I actually 
sometimes wonder if the harpies on Polyargos still remember us!..."

You say in a dry, cynical voice, "I would hope not."

The corners of Ferrous&#39;s mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

the House, and I know you will be a great example to the realm as a Knight of 
the Templars."

for the delay, Lady Ferrous."

In the crystal-clear night sky, the stars twinkle and glow brightly.

Ferrous says in a reflective, hushed voice, "Apology accepted, I suppose."

Ferrous flashes a quick smile towards Runei as she turns towards him.

Ferrous says in a reflective, hushed voice, "The path to Knighthood is not an 
easy one, but dedication and hardwork have made it possible for you to stand 
before us today."

Ferrous says in a reflective, hushed voice, "I have not known you long, but I 
know you will always strive to do what is right."

Ferrous says in a reflective, hushed voice, "May you always be a exemplary 
example of a Templar Knight! Congratulations!"

Runei smiles and says in a thick, gravelly voice, "Thank you Lady Ferrous, I 
shall do my best."

Ferrous&#39;s mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.

In the crystal-clear night sky, the stars twinkle and glow brightly.

encouragement with you."

would speak on the candidate&#39;s?"

Mephaos."

Mephaos steps forth, and faces the Candidates.

The corners of Pawlie&#39;s mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

Mephaos says in a deep, powerful voice, "I say the same as Lady Ferrous. I have 
not known you both for to long, but I will say this - both of you make grand 
assets to the Church. I am pleased to call you both Knights."

In the crystal-clear night sky, the stars twinkle and glow brightly.

Mephaos nods his head at Kakotas.

Draekar inclines his head politely at Mephaos.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Is there present a Knight who
would speak of candidate&#39;s chivalry?"

The quiet night breeze soothes you with its intimations of solitude.

Kakotas says to Draekar with a slightly dwarven accent, "Sir If I may."

Draekar smiles and nods at Kakotas.

In the crystal-clear night sky, the stars twinkle and glow brightly.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "The House calls Sir Kakotas."

Draekar grins mischievously at Kakotas.

Kakotas says with a slightly dwarven accent, "I have watched both of you grow 
from acolytes."

Knights can say."

incredible odds."

the smallest among us exceptionally."

Ferrous&#39;s mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.

Draekar begins to wield a regal jousting lance in his left hand.

Kakotas says with a slightly dwarven accent, "And I&#39;ve watched both of you show 
the level of piety and leadership needed to become Knights."

Kakotas says with a slightly dwarven accent, "My words as such then are these 
echoed from Lord Deuchalion. Do Justly and Walk Humbly."

Kakotas resumes his position next to the Arch-Justiciar.

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "There is space now if any 
others wish to speak."

Sir Barock Del&#39;Strata, Knight of Shallam says, "I have a few words."

you, and bled beside you."

any words at this time?"

speak to the candidates afterwards."

Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "We shall continue."

be within our power and a proper thing, it shall be yours."
Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "I wish the accolade of Knighthood be
bestowed upon these fine men, Justiciars Synbios and Runei."
Pausing for a second in contemplation Draekar bows his head momentarily before
lifting it again in a glance across the gathered crowd.
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says commandingly, "What say you
Brethren Knights? Is it your judgment that Justiciar Synbios and Justiciar Runei
are worthy to be numbered among us in prowess, loyalty, and courtesy?"

Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "My proteges, from the time that you
have chosen the Path of the Templars, I have attempted to teach you what you
need to journey upon this Path. I have shown you the ways of prowess, courtesy,
devotion, chivalry, honour, and piety. In return, you have shown me that not
only have you understood these concepts, but that you have mastered them in your
own special way."
Lady Ariye Trenia Zuiho_sho, Samadhi says, "Our relationship does not end now,
it only changes. Instead of calling you a Squire, I can also call you my
Brother."
Draekar inclines his head in acknowledgement of Lady Trenia, before turning to
face Synbios and Runei.
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Right mindful of your prowess
in the field, your exemplary soul, and responsive to the wishes of your peers,
we are minded to make you both Knights this day."
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Know that to wear the regalia
of a Templar is to hold a sacred trust and know that the obligations of
Knighthood will demand your best efforts every moment of your life."
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "A Knight of the Holy Church
must respect all Deities and their Orders, never offending the Faith of another,
yet knowing that our reverence is reserved for those Deities who represent
Goodness, Light, Righteousness, Valour, Compassion, Wisdom, Justice, and other
such qualities that the Church deems worthy."
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "A Knight must respect all
those who are weak or defenseless, whether because of age, infirmity, poverty or
vow, and be steadfast in defending them."
Runei kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "As a Knight you must ever
keep your word true and free of deception. You must tolerate no harm to the
innocent, keep true to the tenets of Knighthood as you will swear to hereafter,
and hold true to the laws of the Holy Church which you have already each been
made aware of."
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "The laws of the House require
that a Knight be prow, as you have demonstrated on the field of battle, holy as
shown by the pureness of your soul, courteous as you have always presented
yourself to be and as these noble Templars attest, and loyal to the House and
the Holy Church of Achaea as we do know each of you to be."
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Do each of you understand and
accept this?"
Runei says in a thick, gravelly voice, "Aye Sir, I do."
You have tmoted: Synbios lowers his head for a moment, then utters a quiet, "Aye
Sir."
You drop to one knee, demonstrating your humility and respect.
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Do both of you then desire to
accept the burden of Knighthood and swear fealty to the Holy Church and the
House?"
Runei says in a thick, gravelly voice, "Yes Sir."
You say in a dry, cynical voice, "If the growth of Creation is the goal, then I
gladly accept the burden."
Lord Templar Draekar Rian, Phaestean Knight says, "Now then you shall swear
fealty to the Holy Church and to the House."
Draekar nods his head at Kakotas.
