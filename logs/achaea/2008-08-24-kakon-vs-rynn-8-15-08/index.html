The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant 
and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn 
Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

Lifting your head, you whistle an intricate, lilting tune. You are soon answered
by a blue-feathered songbird that wings swiftly in and perches upon your 
shoulder.

At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant 
and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn 
Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.
You see exits leading east and west.

bombs, 2 echinacea roots in 2 groups, 5 kola nuts in 5 groups, 2 sileris berries
in 2 groups, some bayberry bark, a hawthorn berry, 2 pieces of irid moss in 2 
groups.
You are wearing:

Shallows beside a mighty waterfall.
Rushing water swirls and eddies around several large boulders, a raging current 
flowing rapidly toward the edge of the nearby waterfall. The sounds of water are

seem to afford means to cross the river in haste. A blue roan ambles about here,
tail swishing. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground 
for food. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

Shallows beside a mighty waterfall.
Rushing water swirls and eddies around several large boulders, a raging current 
flowing rapidly toward the edge of the nearby waterfall. The sounds of water are
everywhere blocking out nearly all other noise, making speech impossible. Along 
the bank, the roots of a mighty oak dangle precariously into the river, the 
earth that once succored them eroded away over the centuries. Sandbars and rocks
seem to afford means to cross the river in haste. A blue roan ambles about here,
tail swishing. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground 
for food. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

Rynn drifts away into the soft music of the Berceuse, abandoning himself to its 
soporific tones.

You are too stunned to be able to do anything.

the accentato.

Rynn takes some salve from a vial and rubs it on his legs.

Shallows beside a mighty waterfall.
Rushing water swirls and eddies around several large boulders, a raging current 
flowing rapidly toward the edge of the nearby waterfall. The sounds of water are

earth that once succored them eroded away over the centuries. Sandbars and rocks
seem to afford means to cross the river in haste. A blue roan ambles about here,
tail swishing. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground

noticeably, channeling all its force into the nearby cataract. The icy water, 
fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar Mountains, is more numbing than 
refreshing, and the crossing to the east is daunting indeed. A partially

Sheets of flat shale form a rocky ledge overlooking a tumultuous waterfall to

rocks below. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and refined, 
a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of 
the Mojushai is here, sprawled on the floor.

The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses

nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar

daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face, 
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into

leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into 
the ground here. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and

Rynn eases himself out of the Dragon stance.

3820h, 4460m, 17231e, 19356w cexkdb-
Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A 
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of 
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the 
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar 
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is 
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face, 
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into 
the ground here. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground 
for food.
You see exits leading east and in.

who remains unimpressed.

At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant

The Anthem shifts, protecting from physical blunt damage.
3820h, 4213m, 17183e, 19226w cekdb-
At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant 
and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn 
Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.
You see exits leading east and west.
3820h, 4213m, 17183e, 19226w cekdb-

You charge with a lunge towards Rynn, your sword at the ready.
Cascade by granite bluffs.
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A blue roan
ambles about here, tail swishing. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is 
here.
You see exits leading east and in.
With a cry of delight you skewer Rynn on your blade, who writhes and screams as 
the cruel metal is driven deep into his flesh.
3820h, 4452m, 17191e, 19232w cekdb-
At the edge of Muurn Falls.
Shallows beside a mighty waterfall.
Shale ledge.
You can see no further.
3820h, 4452m, 17191e, 19232w cekdb-
Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A 
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of 
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the 
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar 
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is 
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face, 
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into 
the ground here. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and 
refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn Etienne,

Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A 
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of 
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the 
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar 
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is 
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face, 
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into 
the ground here. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and 
refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn Etienne,
Fist of the Mojushai is here.

irid moss in 2 groups.
You are wearing:

The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more

boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses 
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Insei Rynn

The songblessing upon the rapier sings out with a piercing high note.
3607h, 4782m, 17100e, 19099w cekdb-

At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses 
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar 
Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand. 
Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

Rynn winces as the Contradanse melody swells sharply.
2889h, 4582m, 17117e, 19082w cekdb-
A look of extreme focus crosses the face of Rynn.
2889h, 4582m, 17117e, 19082w cekdb-
Rynn eats some prickly ash bark.

The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more

boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses 
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar 
Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand.

The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses 
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar 
Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand.

3820h, 4782m, 16981e, 18823w cekdb-
Rynn takes a long drag off his oaken pipe.

3820h, 4782m, 16981e, 18823w cekdb-
At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses 
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar 
Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand. 
Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.
You see exits leading east and west.
3820h, 4782m, 16981e, 18823w cekdb-
Rynn hurls himself towards you with a lightning-fast moon kick.
He connects to the left arm!
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18823w cekdb-
You are wielding a golden Theran rapier in your left hand and a blackwood lute 
in your right hand.
You are holding:
37 applewood vials, a gleaming scimitar, a Shield of Absorption, a simple oaken 
pipe, 7 arrows, a soot-blackened tinderbox, an iron-tipped whip, a black-walnut 
vial, an ornately carved ivory pipe, a polished marble pipe, 7 purple heartwood 
vials, 3 dust bombs, 3 echinacea roots in 3 groups, 5 kola nuts in 5 groups, 2 
sileris berries in 2 groups, some bayberry bark, a hawthorn berry, 2 pieces of 
irid moss in 2 groups.
You are wearing:
3 simple bone rings, a sailor's kitbag, bright pink man-panties, a black bandana
, a tattoo resembling an Ace of Spades, a small cobra-head pouch, a pair of soft
leather boots, a leather falconry glove, a suit of leather armour.
You have 37 types of items in the Rift.
You have 89 items and no gold.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18823w cekdb-
Rynn forms a spear hand and stabs out at you.

3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cekdb-
Rynn drifts away into the soft music of the Berceuse, abandoning himself to its 
soporific tones.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cekdb-
The structure of protection afforded by the Anthem decays with the final notes 
of the composition.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cekdb-
The Hallelujah's final amen fills you with awe at its power, and sorrow for the 
ending of this uplifting piece.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cekdb-
You have recovered balance on all limbs.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cexkdb-
Rynn clenches his fists and grits his teeth.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cexkdb-
You inhale deeply and begin holding your breath.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cexkdb-
You cease holding your breath and exhale loudly.
You will now aim your attacks wherever you see openings.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cexkdb-
You rub some prefarar on a golden Theran rapier.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cexkdb-
You weave strands of melodies over your blade, tunesmithing it with the power of
the pesante.
3107h, 4732m, 16981e, 18819w cexkdb-
You viciously jab a golden Theran rapier into Rynn.
Rynn quickly jumps back, avoiding the attack.
3107h, 4732m, 16968e, 18819w cekdb-
Composing a few clever lines in your head, you quickly sing a jaunty limerick at
Rynn, who seems to pay no notice.
3107h, 4632m, 16968e, 18799w cekdb-
You must regain balance first.
3107h, 4632m, 16968e, 18799w cekdb-
Rynn looks distracted, carried away a few moments by the bright rhythms of the 
Divertimento.
3107h, 4632m, 16968e, 18799w cekdb-
Rynn begins to jump and prance, hopping along to the irresistible music of the 
Reel.
3107h, 4632m, 16968e, 18799w cekdb-
You do not bleed, my friend.
3107h, 4632m, 16968e, 18799w cekdb-

At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far 
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged 
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses 
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar 
Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand.

The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more 
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley, 
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far

boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An 
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of 
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses 
the ground for food. Scholar Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a

Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A 
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of 
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the 
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar 
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is 
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face, 
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into 
the ground here. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and 
refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Scholar Daklore 
Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand. Insei

The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A 
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of

daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face, 
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into 
the ground here. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground 
for food. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the east.

Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A 
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of 
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the 
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar 
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is 
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face, 
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into 
the ground here. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground 
for food. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the east. A blue roan ambles 
about here, tail swishing. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant

boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant

boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant

Rushing water swirls and eddies around several large boulders, a raging current
flowing rapidly toward the edge of the nearby waterfall. The sounds of water are
everywhere blocking out nearly all other noise, making speech impossible. Along
the bank, the roots of a mighty oak dangle precariously into the river, the
earth that once succored them eroded away over the centuries. Sandbars and rocks
seem to afford means to cross the river in haste. A blue roan ambles about here,
tail swishing. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground
for food. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

Shallows beside a mighty waterfall.
Rushing water swirls and eddies around several large boulders, a raging current
flowing rapidly toward the edge of the nearby waterfall. The sounds of water are
everywhere blocking out nearly all other noise, making speech impossible. Along
the bank, the roots of a mighty oak dangle precariously into the river, the
earth that once succored them eroded away over the centuries. Sandbars and rocks
seem to afford means to cross the river in haste. A blue roan ambles about here,
tail swishing. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground
for food. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

Shallows beside a mighty waterfall.
Rushing water swirls and eddies around several large boulders, a raging current
flowing rapidly toward the edge of the nearby waterfall. The sounds of water are

earth that once succored them eroded away over the centuries. Sandbars and rocks
seem to afford means to cross the river in haste. A blue roan ambles about here,
tail swishing. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground
for food. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

3732h, 4310m, 17381e, 19519w cexkdb-
You begin to wield a gleaming scimitar in your left hand.
3732h, 4310m, 17381e, 19519w cexkdb-
You raise your scimitar over your head and begin to swing it in a wide circle,
gaining speed as you go.
3732h, 4310m, 17231e, 19519w cekdb-
Rynn stands up and stretches his arms out wide.
3732h, 4310m, 17231e, 19519w cekdb-
Rynn drifts away into the soft music of the Berceuse, abandoning himself to its
soporific tones.
3732h, 4310m, 17231e, 19519w cekdb-
Rynn clenches his fists and grits his teeth.
3732h, 4310m, 17231e, 19519w cekdb-
Rynn eases himself out of the Dragon stance.
Rynn leaves to the east.
A roan horse quietly trots to the east.
3732h, 4310m, 17231e, 19519w cekdb-
You have recovered balance on all limbs.
3732h, 4310m, 17231e, 19519w cexkdb-
You cease the whirling of your weapon over your head.
You cease wielding a gleaming scimitar in your left hand.
You relax your grip.
3732h, 4310m, 17241e, 19525w cexkdb-
You aren't wielding anything.

You begin to wield a Shield of Absorption in your right hand.
3732h, 4310m, 17241e, 19525w cexkdb-
You concentrate on gripping tightly with your hands.
3732h, 4310m, 17241e, 19525w cexkdb-
Cascade by granite bluffs.
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. The river Muurn roars swiftly
along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A sheer bluff forms the western
wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of escape. The riverbed narrows
noticeably, channeling all its force into the nearby cataract. The icy water,
fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar Mountains, is more numbing than
refreshing, and the crossing to the east is daunting indeed. A partially
submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face, leading only to darkness. A
rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. Elegant and
refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food.
You see exits leading east and in.
3732h, 4310m, 17241e, 19525w cexkdb-
At the edge of Muurn Falls.
A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the
Mojushai is here.
You see exits leading east and west.
Thy foe is too close for thee to lunge at.
3732h, 4310m, 17239e, 19525w cekdb-
Rynn eats some irid moss.
You must regain balance first.
3732h, 4310m, 17239e, 19525w cekdb-
You lightly strike the side of Rynn's head with your rapier.
3732h, 4310m, 17209e, 19525w ckdb-
You have recovered balance on all limbs.
3732h, 4310m, 17209e, 19525w cxkdb-
You begin reciting an epic tale of the heroism of Nicator to Rynn, holding him
spellbound.
The songbird upon your shoulder twitters an irritating, mind-numbing ditty at
Rynn.
3732h, 4160m, 17219e, 19495w cxkdb-
Rynn eats a bloodroot leaf.
3732h, 4160m, 17219e, 19501w cxkdb-
At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley,
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant
and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn
Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.
You see exits leading east and west.

The corners of your mouth turn up as you grin mischievously.

3732h, 4160m, 17229e, 19507w cexkdb-
You laughingly say, "Like my new tactic?"

You lightly strike the side of Rynn's head with your rapier.
3820h, 4160m, 17209e, 19513w ckdb-
You sing a sonorous chant, stripping the caloric salve defence of Rynn.
3820h, 4010m, 17209e, 19483w ckdb-
Rynn cries out with a look of pain as the Bagatelle strikes a sharp, piercing

Shale ledge.
Sheets of flat shale form a rocky ledge overlooking a tumultuous waterfall to
the west. The noise is almost deafening as the water rushes past cascading off
the edge in a thunderous roar of power. Cold moisture thickens the air, quickly
dampening everything within range. Lichen has attached to the sides of most rock
formations in the area. A treacherous looking path descends to another ledge of
rocks below. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and refined,

Mountainside descending onto clouds.
The rugged mountainside terrain that stretches to the west begins to descend to
the east at this point, until it reaches an expanse of clouds that connect the
mountains to the roof of the Pantheon. The air is thin and barely breathable,
the ground cold and grey, jagged rocks make walking difficult and painful. There

is little visible sign of plant life or recognisable landmarks of any sort,
providing little in the way of easy navigation. A blue roan ambles about here,
tail swishing. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground
for food. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here, sprawled on the

The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more

boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses

At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley,
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant
and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn
Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.
You see exits leading east and west.

You viciously jab a golden Theran rapier into Rynn.
The songblessing unleashes a stunning percussive blast.

You see exits leading east and in.
With a cry of delight you skewer Rynn on your blade, who writhes and screams as
the cruel metal is driven deep into his flesh.

Shallows beside a mighty waterfall.
Shale ledge.

3820h, 4452m, 17191e, 19232w cekdb-
Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face,
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into

2836h, 2417m, 17153e, 19158w cexkdb-
Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face,
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into
the ground here. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and
refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn Etienne,
Fist of the Mojushai is here.
You see exits leading east and in.

Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face,
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into
the ground here. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and
refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Insei Rynn Etienne,

farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An

At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley,
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar
Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand.

Rynn drifts away into the soft music of the Berceuse, abandoning himself to its
soporific tones.

At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley,
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar
Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand.
Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar

You inhale deeply and begin holding your breath.
3820h, 4582m, 16994e, 18833w cexkdb-
Rynn forms a spear hand and stabs out at you.
He connects to the right arm!

Rynn forms a spear hand and stabs out at you.
He connects to the right arm!
3032h, 4582m, 16994e, 18833w cexkdb-

You cease holding your breath and exhale loudly.
You will now aim your attacks wherever you see openings.
3032h, 4582m, 16994e, 18833w cexkdb-
You rub some curare on a golden Theran rapier.
3032h, 4582m, 16994e, 18833w cexkdb-
You weave strands of melodies over your blade, tunesmithing it with the power of
the pesante.
3032h, 4532m, 16994e, 18823w cexkdb-
Lightning-quick, you jab Rynn with a golden Theran rapier.
Horror overcomes Rynn's face as his body stiffens into paralysis.
The songblessing unleashes a stunning percussive blast.
3032h, 4532m, 16981e, 18823w cekdb-
You must regain balance first.
3032h, 4532m, 16981e, 18823w cekdb-
You suddenly perceive the vague outline of an aura of rebounding around Rynn.
3032h, 4532m, 16981e, 18823w cekdb-
At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley,
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Insei Rynn
Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here. Scholar Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is
here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand.

Rynn drifts away into the soft music of the Berceuse, abandoning himself to its
soporific tones.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cekdb-
The structure of protection afforded by the Anthem decays with the final notes
of the composition.
3107h, 4782m, 16981e, 18829w cekdb-
The Hallelujah's final amen fills you with awe at its power, and sorrow for the
ending of this uplifting piece.

Rynn quickly jumps back, avoiding the attack.
3107h, 4732m, 16968e, 18819w cekdb-
Composing a few clever lines in your head, you quickly sing a jaunty limerick at
Rynn, who seems to pay no notice.
3107h, 4632m, 16968e, 18799w cekdb-
You must regain balance first.
3107h, 4632m, 16968e, 18799w cekdb-

Divertimento.
3107h, 4632m, 16968e, 18799w cekdb-
Rynn begins to jump and prance, hopping along to the irresistible music of the
Reel.

You must regain equilibrium first.
3681h, 4682m, 17018e, 18618w cxkdb-
Rynn looks distracted, carried away a few moments by the bright rhythms of the
Divertimento.
3681h, 4682m, 17018e, 18618w cxkdb-
Rynn begins to jump and prance, hopping along to the irresistible music of the
Reel.
3681h, 4682m, 17018e, 18618w cxkdb-
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Rynn.

Rynn takes some salve from a vial and rubs it on his skin.
3681h, 4682m, 17018e, 18618w cxkdb-
At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more
than a moment. A quick glance over the edge reveals the verdant Cyrene valley,
farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses
the ground for food. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Scholar
Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a gleaming scimitar in each hand.
Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

You quickly jump back, avoiding the attack.
3287h, 4682m, 17018e, 18624w cxkdb-
The Reel comes around again, sounding as though ready to begin another step, and
suddenly stops.
3287h, 4682m, 17018e, 18624w cxkdb-

3820h, 4782m, 17028e, 18580w cxkdb-
Daklore gives Rynn the once over.
3820h, 4782m, 17028e, 18580w cxkdb-
The Divertimento comes to an immediate end, its last few notes still echoing in
the air.
You have recovered equilibrium.
3820h, 4782m, 17028e, 18580w cexkdb-

At the edge of Muurn Falls.
The noise of cascading water permeates everything here, powerful beyond measure.
The pull of the current is irresistible, making it impossible to linger more

farms and homesteads like a miniscule patchwork quilt wreathed in mist far
below. The remnants of a fisherman's canoe are wedged in between two jagged
boulders at the lip of the falls but there is no sign of its former owner. An
incongruously calm eddy lies behind these boulders, giving an impression of
safety, however fleeting. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses
the ground for food. Scholar Daklore Le'Murzen-Sparrow is here. He wields a

Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face,
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into
the ground here. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Elegant and
refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground for food. Scholar Daklore

Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face,
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into
the ground here. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground
for food. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the east. A blue roan ambles
about here, tail swishing. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face,
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into
the ground here. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground
for food. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the east. A blue roan ambles
about here, tail swishing. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.

Cascade by granite bluffs.
The river Muurn roars swiftly along, buffeted by stones and bars in its path. A
sheer bluff forms the western wall of the river's channel, offering no hope of
escape. The riverbed narrows noticeably, channeling all its force into the
nearby cataract. The icy water, fed by melting snow from high in the Vashnar
Mountains, is more numbing than refreshing, and the crossing to the east is
daunting indeed. A partially submerged natural arch cuts into the cliff face,
leading only to darkness. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into
the ground here. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately noses the ground
for food. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the east. A blue roan ambles
about here, tail swishing. Insei Rynn Etienne, Fist of the Mojushai is here.
You see exits leading east and in.

You will now aim your attacks wherever you see openings.
3209h, 3820m, 17027e, 17531w cexkdb-
You weave strands of melodies over your blade, tunesmithing it with the power of
the accentato.
3209h, 3770m, 17027e, 17521w cexkdb-
Lightning-quick, you jab Rynn with a golden Theran rapier.
The songblessing upon the rapier sings out with a piercing high note.
3209h, 3770m, 17014e, 17521w cekdb-
You must regain balance first.
3209h, 3770m, 17014e, 17521w cekdb-
You may drink another health or mana elixir.
Rynn eases himself out of the Dragon stance.
Rynn leaves to the in.
A roan horse quietly trots to the in.
3209h, 3770m, 17024e, 17527w cekdb-
You take a drink from an applewood vial.
The elixir heals and soothes you.

caves that stretch out before you. A breeze fills the room as the cool cave air
flows out into the hotter outside. Many caverns break off from this central
