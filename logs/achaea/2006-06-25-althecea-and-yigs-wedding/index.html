The soaring ceilings of this elaborate ballroom stand forty feet high, great oaken beams supporting the broad ceiling. Balustrades line the upper level, from which hang long crimson banners, embroidered in gold. The ceiling itself is a huge stained glass window. Each panel between oaken support beams shows a different scene, from front to back of the room. In one is a sunken ship, with the faces of Althecea and Yig visible in the portholes. In another is the founding of the Naga, with a pair of red boxers curiously positioned over the scene. Most striking is a pane portraying this day. Yig, Althecea, and all of you are pictured. The floor here is smooth flagstones, cut in patterns like stone scales. On a raised dais at the southern end of the room stand instruments, playing lovely music by themselves through some magic. On the western wall is a great obsidian altar, a solid trapezoid. Two sculptures adorn the altar, one a hand of basalt, the other a pair of batlike wings, obsidian ridges spreading panes of smoked glass. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. A vicious death adder is here, hood flared in warning. A small tan flying drake flaps about you. A large, domineering falcon is here, snapping its beak fearfully at those who come to close. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master&#39;s side. A dark winged-stallion stands here in majesty. A baby rat timidly moves in the shadows here. Maldaathi Sirrius, Sentry of Mhaldor is here. He wields a steel shortsword in his left hand and a shining steel longsword in his right.

Obzidian Moorgraves, Nocturnal Abyss is here. He wields an Arsenic Fang in his left hand and Ssathisian Dreadlocks in his right. Advocate of Sin Appolonia Le&#39;Coeur-Vallah is here. Naga Rathe is here. He wields an iron-tipped whip in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Rianne Tanaoa-Delanor is here. Maldaathi Varnes Aristata, Knight of Horror is here. Droch Tsara, Juvenis is here. She wields a butterfly net in her left hand. Droch Ladydeath, Genus de Malus is here. Maldaathi Taran Aristata, Squire of Gaillardia is here.

She wields a Druidic quarterstaff in her left hand. Maldaathi Gerund El&#39;Gruul, Squire of Mhaldor is here. Infernal Lorekeeper August Vallah, Runecrafter is here. Femme Fatale Althecea Kaj&#39;ik, Lady of Snakes is here.
You see exits leading north, up (closed door), and down.

The scent of incense and ashes wafts through the air. Yig strides in, to stand by the altar, a gleam in his eye and on his scales.

Music fills the room, a lilting refrain in a minor key. You are reminded of the winds in the mountain, and the sound of rain at night.

Althecea enters amidst a swirl of light perfume, her gown radiant in the torchlight. She walks the aisle to the altar, slowly and elegantly. Her hair, pale as moonlight, shines in the firelight, and her eyes, though swathed in her veil, glow as well.

Althecea steps to Yig&#39;s side and they clasp hands for a moment. He lifts her veil gently, and breathes softly in as he sees her face in the light of the torches.

Clarus Regis Hwolf Defaron, Magistri Malii says, "We are gathered here in the sight of the Lord of Evil, Lord Sartan the Malevolent, and A&#39;vroth&#39;d&#39;mhal, the Demon Queen, to witness the joining of their servants, Yig and Althecea, in marriage. It is a difficult road to walk, that in service of Evil and of Sin. And these two walk it proudly and well. They have shown their faith to city, to Patron, to guild. And they have shown their faith to one another as well. The Lord has granted His chosen the boon of marriage. The Demon Queen has as well. For 20 years and more have these two served their Patrons well and truly. Let us celebrate their bond and seal it."

Yig leans to Althecea, and smiles at her. You hear his words over the music, clear and calm.

Yig says to Althecea, "You waited for me. When we first began this, I was bound to never wed. And for ten years you were content with that. And would have been forever. You were mine, and I yours, and that was enough for us both. Now that I can make you my wife, in name as well as intent, I will honour that faith with my own, forever."

Althecea says to Yig, "The day I met a young Shadowbound will live on in my mind. Never would I have guessed that the young Shadowsnake novice I became enchanted with would grow into such a Xoran. You have been my closest confidant, my strength, and my best friend. Forever again, I am yours."

Clarus Regis Hwolf Defaron, Magistri Malii says to Yig, "Do you take Althecea Kaj&#39;ik to be your wife, in war and in peace, in fire and snow, for life and death, forever?"

Yig looks at Althecea for a long moment, and turns to Hwolf.
Yig says to Hwolf, "Forever."

Clarus Regis Hwolf Defaron, Magistri Malii says to Althecea, "Do you take Yig Dracrotalus to be your husband, in war and in peace, in fire and snow, for life and death, forever?"

Althecea gently reaches over and takes both your hands in her own.
Althecea says to Hwolf, "I do."

Hwolf gives a diamond wedding ring of entwined serpents to Yig.

Yig proudly shows off a diamond wedding ring of entwined serpents: This diamond ring is made from two bands of metal, one gold and one platinum.  The two strips of precious metal are each crafted meticulously to resemble serpents.  The gold band is in the form of an adder, the platinum in the form of a cobra.  The two tiny metal serpents are entwined together, with the crown of the ring formed by their heads, which face one another.  The diamond mounted in the setting between the two snakes\rquote  heads is a perfectly clear stone, flawlessly cut.  Light seems to shimmer from within, like a tiny candle caught within the diamond.

Yig says, "This ring, a symbol of our lives together...will ever return to you, as I will. May it give you life."

Clarus Regis Hwolf Defaron, Magistri Malii says, "These oaths, spoken here, shall bind these two together. What the Lord of Evil and the Lady of Sin have let come to pass, shall never go asunder! I pronounce you wed! May your days be long in the land!"

The image of a great serpent darkens the sky over Mhaldor, marking the wedding of Yig and Althecea.

Yig embraces Althecea with great ardour.

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..congratulations to you both.."

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..if I may utter.. but a few words.."

Yig says, "By all means."

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..Althecea ..I remember when I first met you ..so long ago.."

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..I was young and brash.. you more so.. a firebrand the world was yet to comprehend..."

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..the fire that burn&#39;d in you .. brought you to my eyes and to lead two guilds.. to be known for your mind and your spirit.. I taught you as I could.. nad came to love you .. dearly .. my friend.."

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..Lord Yig.."

Yig tilts his head and listens intently to Crucible.

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..I too remember the young shadowbound.. most fondly.. your propensity to debate.. your skill... all so memorable.."

Yig blushes furiously.

Althecea gives Crucible a compassionate hug.

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..indeed I also remember..some would maybe be surprised that I say fondly.. our time together.. as Dreamers.."

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..you both have touched my life in.. special ways.."

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..both as students.. both as friends.."

Crucible De&#39;Veris says, "..with humility .. I bless your marriage with all that resides within.. grow strong together.. fruitful... but above all.. happy.." '>A ballroom hung with banners.
The soaring ceilings of this elaborate ballroom stand forty feet high, great oaken beams supporting the broad ceiling. Balustrades line the upper level, from which hang long crimson banners, embroidered in gold. The ceiling itself is a huge stained glass window.
