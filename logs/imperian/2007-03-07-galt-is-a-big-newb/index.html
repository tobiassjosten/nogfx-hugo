You gently float to the ground, protected from a nasty fall by your levitation.
Overgrown pathway. (road).
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. An icewall is here, blocking 
passage to the down. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the 
ground. An undulating mass of water, cascading and swirling into itself, has 
settled here. Galt Amherst is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left 
hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see a single exit leading southeast.

Driven by the scent of fresh blood, the leech leaps and attaches itself to 
Galt.
H:336 M:313 E:1664 W:1509 &amp;lt;-b db&amp;gt; 
The sky grows dark as Galt calls upon powerful magicks. Raising his hands 
balefully, he causes lightning bolts, the hammer of the storm, to shoot from 
his hands and slam into a soulmaster. The bolts ricochet off and slam into a 
dervish. The bolts ricochet off and slam into a simpering Sycophant.
A simpering Sycophant springs to a soulmaster's defence.
A demonic hound springs to a soulmaster's defence.
Galt has hit the vitals of his enemy!
The final blow proves too much for a simpering Sycophant, who expires, 
pitifully.
A simpering Sycophant has been slain by Galt.
A simpering Sycophant, your loyal companion, has been slain by Galt Amherst.
A simpering Sycophant screams with rage as the ties that bind it to this plane

With a sudden, quick gesture, you snatch at Galt's aura and pinch the unwanted 
anomaly in the aura.
H:354 M:321 E:1664 W:1508 &amp;lt;-b db&amp;gt;
Your humbug entity leaps at Galt's throat.
Your soulmaster lets loose a horrible scream as it lets part of its being flow 
into Galt.
You sense that the soulmaster entity is in control of Galt's being.
Your bubonis entity scuttles over to Galt and then suddenly leaps up, latching 
itself to his head.
Your demonic worm begins burrowing into Galt's belly.
The gremlin races between the legs of Galt.
