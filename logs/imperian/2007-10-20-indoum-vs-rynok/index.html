Western upper ramparts. (Fourth quarter of the Imperial Spire.)
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. Hovering
on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to
its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its
many eyes. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The
shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from
out of the darkness. Rynok Reopev is here, shrouded. He wields a wicked-looking
daegger in his left hand and a Shield of the Protector in his right.
