Keilani Lynne, Heiress of the Shadows says to you, "Learn your facts well
Krysaliss. For I said nothing about nor against the Saboteurs or their
leadership, I was merely in the room. Being a tyrant will earn you nothing.
I&#39;ve never been afraid to stand up for what is right, and you are wrong. Any
leader would get the entire story from all involved parties before threatening
and pointing fingers. I&#39;m glad to not see you ruin my father&#39;s hard work any
further. And for the rest of you here, I&#39;d think really hard about the
tyranical &#39;god&#39; that is running this guild. I was just outguilded for nothing,
pure contempt for a wayward daughter who no longer claims this selfish woman as
her mother. Farewell everyone. Those of you who I&#39;ve met, seem to have respect,
far more so than Krysaliss Lynne."

A small pile of sovereigns spills from the corpse.

Mykael says, "I hope this madness ends...we may not have enough members.."

Sethren Argyle says, "The Saboteurs are not a total demoncracy, you realize.
But you cannot deny that the leadership is open and honest whenever possible."

Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Pish. Every guild has similar
events throughout their history."

forsaken idiots?"

hear you."

expect we already knew what was coming."

Hiroshi nods his head affirmatively.

Mykael says, "Meaning, do not disrepect any among our ranks if you speak."

Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "If it comes to this point to
begin with."

You say, "Indeed."

You say, "I think I&#39;d like their tongues after all."

Sethren Argyle says, "Ahem."

You give the decapitated head of Xaric to Sethren Argyle.

You give the decapitated head of Keilani to Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi,
Shifting Shadow.

You say, "Cut them out for me, you have much more skill with a blade than I
do."

Azlyn nods sagely.

You grin mischievously at Azlyn.

Iluv nods his head in agreement.

Hiroshi Devilen says, "How do we get out of here."

Hiroshi grins mischievously.

You say, "Not quite yet."

You say, "Do any of you hear have an issue that needs to be raised?"

a moron?"

Mykael tells you, "Sorry that your daughter was corrupted by him, and I ask
that you forgive me for not seeking my evidence out a little more. He just
seemed to be along what I want for the guild, and I never thought of where he
got his sources and his purpose."

Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Someone needs to clean out
the bloody privy in here. It&#39;s getting repugnant."

Sarrius ponders the situation.

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Iluv says, "That eased a lot of tension."

Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Well, i need to ease some,
but I&#39;ll be damned if I sit on that odiforous waste pile."

Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow places the head of Keilani on
the ground. He places his foot on the lower jaw and pulls out the tongue with
his right hand, and quickly cuts the tongue out of the decapitated head. With a
slight grin, he hands the tongue over to Krysaliss.

Sethren begins to wield a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand.

You have emoted: Krysaliss grins happily at Azlyn and quickly pulls a small
glass jar from her pack, the tongue dropping into it with a dull thud.

Sarrius tells you, "Ew."

Sarrius tells you, "Aren&#39;t you atleast going to put some preservative fluid in
it?"

Iluv smiles and says, "Xaric and Keilani won&#39;t be tongue-kissing anytime soon."

Sarrius snickers softly to himself.

Sethren Argyle yawns at Azlyn, deftly breaking open the jaw of Xaric&#39;s head.
Doing so lets the tongue hang out freely, allowing him to cut the tongue off
with a single swipe of his dirk. He tosses it to Krysaliss.

You tell Sarrius Chytovil, "Of course, I don&#39;t exactly carry that around with
me, ya know."

Sethren Argyle says, "Much more efficient."

Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Nor will they be
sleeping with eachother in the guildhall..."

Sethren nods his head.

Sarrius tells you, "Obviously."

Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "I&#39;d have somebody hose
down the parlour before anybody puts it to use again."

Alaron Mikain says, "They won&#39;t be among the living to kiss each other,
either."

Sarrius tells you, "Not like you&#39;d need to. It&#39;s not a common place item you
need every day, heh."

Azlyn rolls his eyes at Sethren.

Alaron licks a needle-pointed dirk.

Mykael leans against the wall.

Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says to Sethren, "I&#39;m four feet
tall...I don&#39;t have the upper body strength for that."

You have emoted: Krysaliss catches the tongue deftly, and tosses it into the
jar with Keilani&#39;s severed tongue.

"Heh heh heh," Sethren chuckles.

Sethren Argyle says, "Anything else, or can we all go? There are tongues that
need preserving."'>Sethren Argyle says, "You broke the Oath of Shadows. Now you face the
consequences. That is all."
(Umbra): Sethren says, "Now go."
(Umbra): You say, "Fucking finally."
(Umbra): Sethren says, "Azlyn! Go."

Mykael says, "Well done Shadows."
Mykael nods his head.
Sarrius tells you, "Effective. Jayvan just ousts people."
Keilani Lynne, Heiress of the Shadows says to you, "Learn your facts well
Krysaliss. For I said nothing about nor against the Saboteurs or their
leadership, I was merely in the room. Being a tyrant will earn you nothing.
I've never been afraid to stand up for what is right, and you are wrong. Any
leader would get the entire story from all involved parties before threatening
and pointing fingers. I'm glad to not see you ruin my father's hard work any
further. And for the rest of you here, I'd think really hard about the
tyranical 'god' that is running this guild. I was just outguilded for nothing,
pure contempt for a wayward daughter who no longer claims this selfish woman as
her mother. Farewell everyone. Those of you who I've met, seem to have respect,
far more so than Krysaliss Lynne."
Sethren ceases to wield a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand.

Sarrius tells you, "Shall we kill Keilani, too?"

Keilani gives a last, feeble gasp as her windpipe is crushed.
Keilani has been slain by Sethren.

Overcome by death, Keilani's spirit fades to grey.

The final blow proves too much for a small black cobra, who expires, pitifully.
A small black cobra has been slain by Azlyn.
A small pile of sovereigns spills from the corpse.
Mykael says, "I hope this madness ends...we may not have enough members.."
Sethren Argyle says, "The Saboteurs are not a total demoncracy, you realize.
But you cannot deny that the leadership is open and honest whenever possible."
Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Pish. Every guild has similar
events throughout their history."
Sethren Argyle says, "Otherwise this trial would not have happened."
You say, "Now that..."
Sethren Argyle says, "They were given more than enough chances."
You say, "This business has been conducted."
Sethren nods his head.
You say, "Everyone here has a voice, and it can be heard freely and without
repurcussion."
Hiroshi gives the decapitated head of Keilani to you.
Alaron tells you, "Where do you find the patience to put up with these god
forsaken idiots?"
You say, "As long as you speak in the -proper- fashion, openly so that all can
hear you."
Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Yes, yes, well, I rather
expect we already knew what was coming."
Hiroshi nods his head affirmatively.
Mykael says, "Meaning, do not disrepect any among our ranks if you speak."

Sethren Argyle says, "Ahem."
You give the decapitated head of Xaric to Sethren Argyle.
You give the decapitated head of Keilani to Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi,
Shifting Shadow.
You say, "Cut them out for me, you have much more skill with a blade than I
do."
Azlyn nods sagely.
You grin mischievously at Azlyn.
Iluv nods his head in agreement.
Hiroshi Devilen says, "How do we get out of here."
Hiroshi grins mischievously.
You say, "Not quite yet."
You say, "Do any of you hear have an issue that needs to be raised?"
Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Yes."
You say, "Speak, Dolson. Make it quick and to the point."
Azlyn begins to wield a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand.
Hiroshi Devilen says, "I really would like to know, did you tell Minotsu I was
a moron?"
Mykael tells you, "Sorry that your daughter was corrupted by him, and I ask
that you forgive me for not seeking my evidence out a little more. He just
seemed to be along what I want for the guild, and I never thought of where he
got his sources and his purpose."
Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Someone needs to clean out
the bloody privy in here. It's getting repugnant."
Sarrius ponders the situation.
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Iluv says, "That eased a lot of tension."
Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Well, i need to ease some,
but I'll be damned if I sit on that odiforous waste pile."
Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow places the head of Keilani on
the ground. He places his foot on the lower jaw and pulls out the tongue with
his right hand, and quickly cuts the tongue out of the decapitated head. With a
slight grin, he hands the tongue over to Krysaliss.
Sethren begins to wield a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand.
You have emoted: Krysaliss grins happily at Azlyn and quickly pulls a small
glass jar from her pack, the tongue dropping into it with a dull thud.
Sarrius tells you, "Ew."
Sarrius tells you, "Aren't you atleast going to put some preservative fluid in
it?"
Iluv smiles and says, "Xaric and Keilani won't be tongue-kissing anytime soon."
Sarrius snickers softly to himself.
Sethren Argyle yawns at Azlyn, deftly breaking open the jaw of Xaric's head.
Doing so lets the tongue hang out freely, allowing him to cut the tongue off
with a single swipe of his dirk. He tosses it to Krysaliss.
You tell Sarrius Chytovil, "Of course, I don't exactly carry that around with
me, ya know."
Sethren Argyle says, "Much more efficient."
Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Nor will they be
sleeping with eachother in the guildhall..."
Sethren nods his head.
Sarrius tells you, "Obviously."
Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "I'd have somebody hose
down the parlour before anybody puts it to use again."
Alaron Mikain says, "They won't be among the living to kiss each other,
either."
Sarrius tells you, "Not like you'd need to. It's not a common place item you
need every day, heh."
Azlyn rolls his eyes at Sethren.
Alaron licks a needle-pointed dirk.
Mykael leans against the wall.
Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says to Sethren, "I'm four feet
tall...I don't have the upper body strength for that."
You have emoted: Krysaliss catches the tongue deftly, and tosses it into the
jar with Keilani's severed tongue.
"Heh heh heh," Sethren chuckles.
Sethren Argyle says, "Anything else, or can we all go? There are tongues that
need preserving."</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+2 points with 4 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04ce4aa9f079c590959ba7c47276549f?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by tobias.sjosten@xxx (admin) on 23Â Sep 2008</p>Kickass!
