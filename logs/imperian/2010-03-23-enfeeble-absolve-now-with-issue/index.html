Indica calls upon the Gods and nods gravely at her Seraph, whose wings flare suddenly as an alien and frightening look of power sweeps across her face. With one hand, the Seraph reaches forward, and as her hand touches his chest, it flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters his breast. The Seraph&#39;s eyes roll back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Trez&#39;s body. Trez collapses without sound; his body now nothing more than a useless husk.
Trez has been slain by Indica.

The administration likely took the view that in this case, Trez&rsquo;s use of the word wasn&rsquo;t a form of sexual harrasment because he was using it as a colloquialism for &lsquo;coward&rsquo; and not as an inappropriate play on Indica&rsquo;s gender. If it helps you, flip the names and pretend Indica had called Trez a &lsquo;dick&rsquo; and Trez had issued for &ldquo;sexual harassment.&rdquo;</p><p>Had Indica issued for foul language, rather than sexual harrasment, her issue might have been upheld, though it&rsquo;s likely the admin would have seen it as far too petty to warrant anything beyond a stern message of reprimand from one of the Admin shells.</p><p>You could make the argument that the administration could have looked at the log, dismissed the &lsquo;sexual harassment&rsquo; complaint and still punished Trez for the foul language. This didn&rsquo;t happen because it&rsquo;s been a longstanding unofficial policy of the administration to only punish instances of offensive language that are either incredibly public (market channel) or specifically complained against. The admin could certainly simply run a search function through their logs and throw up the names of everyone who has sworn in the last five years but it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be that productive a use of their time. To this end, they generally don&rsquo;t go off and punish foul language unless it&rsquo;s been specifically flagged as such.</p><p>Lots of love,
