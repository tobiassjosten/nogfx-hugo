Flourishing woodland.
Chattering animals and whistling birds make this seem more like the middle of 
the Celidon forest than the ruins of an ancient arena. The forest has truly 
come in to entirely reclaim this area. Tall trees stand here, vines connecting 
them, while flowers and other fauna thrive on the ground. A large beehive hangs
down from the trees above. A massive groomed black stallion stands here 
proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. A swarm of bees hovers
menacingly nearby. A mighty earth golem stands guard here. A peaceful aura 
fills the area, emanating from Ziat, Aspect of Aryana. He wields The Conqueror 
of the Void in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading east, south, and down.

proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. A swarm of bees hovers
menacingly nearby. A mighty earth golem stands guard here. A peaceful aura
fills the area, emanating from Ziat, Aspect of Aryana. He wields The Conqueror
of the Void in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.

The heady scent of myrrh wafts through the air, mixed with a hint of primrose.

Ziat takes a drink from a cylindrical sinn vial.

Ziat quickly eats a toadstool.

A pair of vines suddenly lashes out from the undergrowth to entangle you!

Ziat quickly eats a toadstool.

Ziat takes a drink from a cylindrical sinn vial.
&lt; 412h 350m 81% 83s > [ eb b ] [paused]
A thorny vine whips out from behind you, tearing many bleeding wounds into your
flesh.
You feel your aura distend and whip back at Ziat, returning some of the damage
that was meant for you.
&lt; 399h 350m 81% 83s > [ eb b ] [paused]
Ziat quickly eats an orphine seed.
&lt; 399h 350m 81% 83s > [ eb b ] [paused]
An almost unbearable feeling of emptiness heralds the arrival of a cloaked and
(CaNdY): SYSTEM UNPAUSED...
hooded figure carrying a blood-stained sickle. Ziat gasps in terror as a
skeletal hand emerges from the sleeve and points at him. He bows his head to
the inevitable as the manifestation of Death swings its sickle at his neck. You
watch in fascinated horror as his head is severed from his body.
A stream of primal darkness flows out from Ziat.
The bloodleech loses its grip on Ziat and drops to the ground.
A worm loses its grip on Ziat and drops to the ground.
A green slime loses its grip on Ziat and drops to the ground.
A bubonis loses its grip on Ziat and drops to the ground.
A humbug loses its grip on Ziat and drops to the ground.
You have slain Ziat.
Ziat stomps out to the ether, dragging his knuckles on the ground.
You look around triumphantly and realize you are the last one standing. You
have WON the Free-For-All!</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 2 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ceb8f470f1634076d94d429bcc9b030?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by suleyman256@xxx on 25Â Jan 2011</p>Looks like somebody already made a movie of this fight:

This wasn&rsquo;t the full fight either. It was a long one so she couldn&rsquo;t have recorded a full one anyway. In the beginning, I tried using consume when she wasn&rsquo;t even going below 50% health for an incinerate. Consume has a good chance being successful in teams.

He would already have her up under his grove,
He used up all of his sunlight,
He hopes that she likes this,

She thinks she&rsquo;s better than him,</p><p>She&rsquo;s got a chameleon tat,
Just to hide her face,

Waterwalkin&rsquo; shoes on her feet,

When Fazlee lends,
Her,
His,

All figured out,
She needs death tarot up just to get kills,
