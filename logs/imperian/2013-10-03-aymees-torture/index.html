A ladder rack stands against the wall here. A thin parchment scroll has been tacked to a far wall. A 
long iron rod with an unusual symbol on the end lies here. A garrotte device sits quietly awaiting 
its next victim. An Iron Maiden stands here with its door slightly ajar. A strange chair covered in 
holes sits here. An obsidian halberd at the ready, an executioner stands here, his eyes gleaming 
with an eerie greed. Lady Elizabell yn&#39;Chionnal, Mourning in Madness is here. She is holding an 
ornately wrought tablet in her right hand. The undead form of Disciplinarian Raykel Uchiha, Imperial 
Infiltrator is here. He wields a claymore in his hands.
You see a single exit leading north.
Ansol, the Imperial Executioner looks up briefly before turning to check that all the equipment is 
in working order.
