looms darkly beneath your feet. An unadorned bench of green marble sits here. 
Violet fire ripples over a tall obelisk of solid crystal, set into the very

lies here. No bigger than a dwarf, a tiny marble fountain of a cherubim has been
placed here. A slender depiction in silver has been placed here, a resplendent 
sculpture of the Lady of the Arcane. There are 10 monolith sigils here. A 
truesilver pike with the decapitated head of Brishi has been erected by Lionas.

sits here peacefully. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse 
stands here imperially. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. 
Occasionally pouncing on imaginary foes, a fluffy strawberry-hued silril kitten 
plays here. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a massive shire stands here 
poised and alert. A vicious smoke-blue stallion stands here, pawing and stomping
ferociously at the ground. An elite Warrior of Kinsarmar is manning a cannon 
here. He has one-hundred and fifty-one cannon balls. A surly blue bear lumbers 
around the area, growling vehemently. A massive groomed black stallion stands 
here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. Its head poised in
a prideful stance, a sleek black stallion stands here snorting arrogantly. 
Stamping his golden hooves and tossing his crimson mane, this blooded warhorse 
stands here bearing a regal strength. There are 12 elite Mages of Kinsarmar

surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, 
keen eyes gazing upon you. There are 31 elite Runeguard Knights here. An
