Lemuela blinks.

Lemuela quickly eats a primrose stalk.

Comprehension flashes across Lemuela&#39;s face.

You nod your head.

You say, "I&#39;m here."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to you, "Apologies, suppose I should eat primrose more often. I thought it was empty."
 
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I can leave..."

You say, "You are fine."

Lemuela kneels onto one knee, demonstrating her humility and respect.

Lemuela stands up and stretches her arms out wide. Lemuela closes her eyes and bows her head.

You purse your lips contemplatively.

Lemuela snaps her head up suddenly.

Lemuela purses her lips contemplatively.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "....do you remember the dreams I used to have?"

Lemuela creases her brow in a frown.

You ask, in Akrabi, "The nightmares?"

Lemuela nods slowly.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "A great darkness that blotted out the light..."

You nod slowly.

You say, "I remember."

Lemuela gives a pained sigh.

You tilt your head curiously.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "....wish I knew to have warned..."

You raise an eyebrow questioningly.

You ask, "Warned?"

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Had I known the nightmares were of all this I could have done something. Maybe stopped the Onyx from leaving."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Duister sent me to find information on the tainted forest, but even then I couldn&#39;t find the meaning in time."

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "She is a fool."

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "She gives herself too much credit, Idrasi. This is a lethal flaw in a lesser being."

Lemuela creases her brow in a frown.

Lemuela sighs deeply, turning to face the entryway.

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "You speak of Lemuela being foolish? What she is spouting is nonesense."

You ask, in Akrabi, "Leaving?"

Lemuela shrugs helplessly.

Lemuela slumps down dejectedly.

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Aye."

Lemuela whispers softly over her shoulder in your direction, "He has come to me, Faithful".

You say, in Akrabi, "I do know the Marble walks with His truefavour. He is not silent."

You have emoted: Emeren narrows his eyes warily, standing still as he surveys the room.

Lemuela shakes her head.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "In my mind."

You say, in Akrabi, "What is that demon saying? Speak!"

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "That she would call Him silent because He does not speak to her? Arrogant beyond acceptability. Nonsense."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I grow exhausted under his magick and when I sleep the nightmares begin again, but in them it is I who join him. I am the darkness."

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "There is nothing forcing you to speak to her, however."

Lemuela turns to you with an expression of weariness.

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "This is foolishness, I feel dimwitted by her very presence."

You give a pained sigh.

You ask, in Akrabi, "Do you feel tainted?"

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I was the first to reach out to him after his betrayal. I sought to redeem him and now he entices me to join him."

Lemuela shakes her head.

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "I did no such thing. She is unworth my time and attention."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I feel weary from battle."

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "She is not prepare for the strength I have gained."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Perhaps the Marble was right.....my compassion is my greatest weakness."

You ask, in Akrabi, "He entices you with what?"

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Clever."

Lemuela rubs her eyes tiredly.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Trying to stay awake..."

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Thank you my friend. I enjoy the art of manipulation."

You say, in Akrabi, "Sleep."

Lemuela shakes her head.

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "You&#39;d do well to recall we share no bond of &#39;friendship&#39;, Idrasi."

You say, in Akrabi, "I will not be distrubed again."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You would throw me into the land of nightmares so easily?"

Lemuela rubs her eyes tiredly.

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "You should know what I mean when I say that now."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You asked what he intices with..."

You say, in Akrabi, "I can knock you out, ending the problem of dreams."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Visions of power. Unbridled power to match the Divine. Vengeance. Cold vengeance in unleashing such devastating darkness across the enemy that one could destroy our enemies armies."

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Interesting what she says."

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "She merely recalls what I demonstrated, not what I offered. She is unworthy."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "There would be no more enemies of the Light. All who defy Him would be destroyed instantly in a wall of darkness. Think of it, Faithful. The shrines you hate so greatly exploding violently by power unleashed by you."

You slap Lemuela on the cheek.

Lemuela gives a horrified gasp.

Lemuela blinks.

You say, in Akrabi, "Snap out of it."

Lemuela blinks.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Wh...why did you just hit me?"

You say, in Akrabi, "Don&#39;t get bent out of shape for me hitting you. Marble has driven her sitara through my left hand."

Lemuela rubs the side of her face gently, blinking back tears.

You say, in Akrabi, "Obviously the last part was pure nonesense."

Lemuela blinks.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You hit me because I refused to sleep?"

You say, in Akrabi, "No, you are not listening."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You said the last part."

You say, in Akrabi, "Of what you spoke to me right before I hit you."

Lemuela nods slowly.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Aye....of not wanting to sleep..."

You exclaim, in Akrabi, "You were asking me to join the tainted!"

Lemuela blinks.

"What?" Lemuela asks curiously.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Excuse me?"

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order exclaims, "I said I was having nightmares of being tainted, not that I really was!"

Lemuela blinks once, slowly, then collapses on the ground, suddenly fallen into a deep sleep.Lemuela&#39;s eyes close suddenly as she falls asleep.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Alright, alright, knock me out then."

You quietly step up behind Lemuela, bringing the pommel of your sitara to bear and cracking it across the base of her skull in one deft movement.

Kayden tells you, "You are on your own for now, Idrasi. My focus is required elsewhere."

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Fine."

Lemuela rubs her eyes tiredly.

Lemuela rubs the back of her head at the large knot forming.

You say, "You might need to rub some restoration for that."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Apologies if me mentioning my nightmares offended you, Faithful."

Lemuela nods her head.

Lemuela rubs some salve on her head.

"Ooowwwww!", Lemuela whines.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Burns."

 Emeren clears his throught and begins to quote, ""There would be no more enemies of the Light. All who defy Him would be destroyed instantly in a wall of darkness. Think of it, Faithful. The shrines you hate so greatly exploding violently by power unleashed by you."".

Lemuela twitches spasmodically.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Who said that?"

Coldly, you say to Lemuela, "You did."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Nay, that&#39;s impossible. It&#39;s almost identical to what Kayden said to me as he killed Council members. Well except the shrine part."

Lemuela spits on the ground in disgust.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He believes he still is His Onyx. That the Lord commands him to smite our enemies through strengthening his body with the new powers."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He&#39;s gone into madness."

Lemuela curls her lip and sneers arrogantly.

You say, "Do not doubt what I say! I know what came from your mouth, do not call me a liar."

Lemuela cautiously looks at you, backing away slightly.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Faithful....are you possibly hearing things?"

Lemuela gulps nervously.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He has the power to be with the wind now. He can whisper such words in the ears of those he chooses to join in madness."

You say, "Do not get coy with me."

Lemuela gives you a concerned look.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I am only concerned, Faithful."

You say, "I just quoted back what you said to me, why I hit you."

(Order): You say, "Can I get your counsel on this matter, Duister?"

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Those are words not to be taken lightly and to accuse me, one of His most loyal that I have taken the Oath of Celibacy of using such words is.....
blasphemy."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You are still bitter of me to say such hateful things."

You say, "I have moved on, I hold no resentment."

Lemuela raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I can see by your accusation that you haven&#39;t."

You say, "Did I say I was accusing you? You say that."

Lemuela gives a pained sigh.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I am tired. It takes little these days for me to grow very tired. If not the nightmares in which he comes, then the whispers when I least expect 
it."

You say, "Ignore him."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I am....trying..."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Though I wonder at times how much a person could stand in the darkness before going insane."

You say, "Maybe you should seek a medicine doctor and find something to make you sleep without dreaming."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Aye, I think I shall."

Lemuela cringes pathetically.

You say, "And alert me when you hear him whispering in your head."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He whispers now."

You say, "There is safety in numbers, being alone is tough to overcome."

You ask, "What is he saying?"

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I...I am not allowed to speak unless my blood is spilt often."

You have emoted: With great annoyance, Emeren quickly grabs hold of her finger, and quickly slices the flesh. A thin trickle of blood oozes out from the wound.

"Ouch!", Lemuela shrieks in pain.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I meant he&#39;ll kill me over and over if I say anything."

Lemuela sucks on her finger angrily looking at you.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "First you slap me, then you cut me? Accuse me of speaking words of darkness?"

You say, "The Light does not give in to the tainted. They are the weaker ones, not you."

(Order): You say, "Come here now, Faithful."

Lemuela gulps nervously.

You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, "Dealing with Lemuela issue."

Sarciossis arrives from the southwest.

Sarciossis nods his head at you politely.

You say to Sarciossis, "Hail, Faithful."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to you, "He says the Lord knew....all along Him and Duister knew."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says to you, "Tidings, brother."

Lemuela inclines her head, piously clasping her hands before her and bows to Sarciossis respectfully.

Sarciossis tells you, "What&#39;s going on?"

You ask, "Knew what?"

Sarciossis clicks.

You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, "Just observe and ask your own questions."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "About the darkness. Everything with the Redwoods. That His Hand would go into the darkness because he could never hide his intentions from Him. So He had to know."

You ask, "Is he still inside your head?"

Lemuela nods slowly.

You give a pained sigh.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He says it is written in blood. Blood that was forged in the Garden. That his destiny is absolute."

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, "Do you hear this?"

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Curious girl, Idrasi. Though I cannot say I find your where your interest in her stems from. She is so frail. So... damaged."

Lemuela gives you a concerned look.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Could it be?"
 
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Who is he?"

Sarciossis clicks.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Kayden."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I have nightmares of darkness. I had them before all of this. That a great darkness would eclipse the light. I told Faithful Emeren of them."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Then all of this happened and now I have nightmares where I am in the darkness."

You say, in Akrabi, "She spoke to me, or rather Kayden did through her."

You say, in Akrabi, "I am not sure still."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "What exactly did I say?"

Lemuela blinks.

Sarciossis ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to Sarciossis, "I honestly do not remember saying anything of the sort."

You say, in Akrabi, "I can still quote again."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Kayden is informing you that he was instructed to go into the Redwoods, or Stavenn?"

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He was instructed to join the darkness."

Sarciossis clicks.

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Instructed? No. The child is a babbling fool. I merely led her to the obvious conclusion that He was aware."

You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, in Akrabi, "Do you see my problem?"

Sarciossis ponders a demonic lamia&#39;s profile, wondering if it would make a suitable subject for a portrait.

Sarciossis tells you, "Of trusting her word, or kayden&#39;s?"

A dove comes flying into the room, deposits a letter into your hands, warbles cheerfully, and flies away.

You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, in Akrabi, "Her word."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He says the Lord knew what he was going to do and allowed it."

You read what is written on an elegant white letter:                        Adanedhel is phased at your spot.

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Why is the Crux Shade phased here?"

Sarciossis tells you, "She is speaking to him, that is true enough."

Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "I have no affiliations to such people."

Sarciossis tells you, "As far as the truth of his words? He is a misguided and foolish man who dwells upon his own pride."

Lemuela enacts the Rite of Piety, declaring that all must be bound by her faith in the God of Light.

Lemuela lays down a spiritual seance, calling on the God of Light to expose those who might reside on an alternate plane of being.

You have emoted: Emeren clears his throught and begins to quote, ""There would be no more enemies of the Light. All who defy Him would be destroyed instantly in a wall of darkness. Think of it, Faithful. The shrines you hate so greatly exploding violently by power unleashed by you."".

You say, in Akrabi, "She told me that to me earlier."

Sarciossis tells you, "It is not beyond Kayden to claim that he was sent by the One Above."

You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, in Akrabi, "Need to seperate lies from truth."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to Sarciossis, "I don&#39;t remember it, honest. I even suggested maybe it&#39;s possible he whispered it to the Faithful? Or giving illusions?"

Sai Kayden arrives from the ether.

Kayden raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Lemuela spits on the ground in disgust.

Sarciossis clicks.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Now, child, what have you to say?"

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Betrayer. This is His holy place. Be gone or be smited."

Sarciossis taps his foot with mild impatience.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Do not tempt my blade, Idrasi. You and I are both aware of the outcome."

Lemuela falls back into a defensive stance, mace held close.

Kayden smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "To kayden I understand you are claiming to be.. taking a journey?"

Sarciossis looks up into the air for divine inspiration.
 
Kayden&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sarciossis points accusingly at Kayden.
 
Sarciossis nods his head.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "I am doing as commanded. He instructs to grow. To gain power. To strengthen. I am doing that. My sacrifices will come to be revered. Mark it."

You spit on the ground in disgust.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He would never command such and as His former Hand you know it to be true."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Gaining power by casting yourself into the dark heart of those new Redwoods?"

Sarciossis clicks.

You say, in Akrabi, "This is merely a shadow, a copy, a doppleganger."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "You would prefer my physical presence, Idrasi? Consider your reply carefully, then."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Such power is to be gained at a lofty price, old friend."

Lemuela looks up at Sarciossis quickly.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to Sarciossis, "You were old friends?"

You say, in Akrabi, "I am aware of where his newfound strength comes from."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Some would argue too close."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Of course. It takes a man of strength to obtain it without losing himself to it. I will mince no words, there. It is, however, why I have not taken 
others with me."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "The depth of Faith required for this endeavor is... staggering."

You say, in Akrabi, "To kayden heh."

You give a pained sigh.

Kayden smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Faith, or pride, old friend?"

Sarciossis clicks.

You say to Kayden, in Akrabi, "You are too amused."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "I yet await your reply, Idrasi. As to whether you prefer my physical being?"

Kayden raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "The Marble tells me differently. She said you begged her to join with you and spilled her blood when she refused."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Faith. In all things, Faith. You should know this better than any, Folklorist."

Kayden reaches out and clenches a fist before Lemuela, who screams and doubles over in agony as her skin suddenly bubbles with gangrenous growths.

Lemuela gives a horrified gasp.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "I did not ask for argument, child."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Nay, but you receive truth instead...."
 
Lemuela coughs softly.

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Such is the Light. Remember it well, former Hand."

A rumbling is suddenly heard in the distance, followed by a violent crackling of energy all around you.

Sarciossis clicks.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "You are excused from this conversation, Cleric. Your next words will be your last."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Your words fill my head with filth. You have dragged me into this darkness and I will stay until Light shines once again."

Kayden utters a short incantation, his body slowly fading from sight. Only his laboured breathing warns you of his presence, and in seconds even this grows muffled and silent.

Lemuela steps back, raising her mace.

A gentle hum arises from Lemuela&#39;s seraph, as it raises a shield to protect her.

Kayden rubs his fingers briskly on a Tarot card.

Kayden growls menacingly.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Very well."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "The Master will be with you shortly."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to Sarciossis, "The...Master...?"

Adanedhel appears and slowly solidifies as a ritual seance draws him back to the material plane.

Lunging forth on its master&#39;s command, an elite Idrasi wolfrider&#39;s fierce mount tears into Adanedhel with its fangs.

Adanedhel, Aspect of Moradeim leaves to the southwest, a feeling of confusion leaving with him.

You say, in Akrabi, "Kayden himself."

Fangs bared in warning, an arctic wolf carries an Idrasi wolfrider from the southwest.
Fangs bared in warning, an arctic wolf carries an Idrasi wolfrider from the southwest.
Fangs bared in warning, an arctic wolf carries an Idrasi wolfrider from the southwest.
Fangs bared in warning, an arctic wolf carries an Idrasi wolfrider from the southwest.
Fangs bared in warning, an arctic wolf carries an Idrasi wolfrider from the southwest.
An Idrasi wolfrider lets out a shrill whistle, and his mount carries him to the southwest.
An Idrasi wolfrider lets out a shrill whistle, and his mount carries him to the southwest.

An elite Idrasi wolfrider says, "I heard a scream at &#39;An ancient lava tube!&#39; Excuse me, friends."
An elite Idrasi wolfrider exclaims, "Did you hear that? Someone&#39;s in trouble at &#39;An ancient lava tube&#39;!"

You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Only a Sith deals with absolutes!"

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance asks you, in Akrabi, "Did I not just prove such? Did I not just punish a Congregant, as two Priests dared not overturn my Judgement?"

Kayden tilts his head and listens intently.

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "Strength of might does not mean truth."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "Perhaps it is clear, even as you deny it vocally, that you are each aware of who and what I truly am, aye? Perhaps, though you dare not speak it, you are wholly aware that I am far progressed along the path towards the Light."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Kayden, in Akrabi, "Away."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "If I grow strong, I feed the Self. If I come awash in the blood of the fallen, I feed the Self. If I stand before those who hate Him, and cut them down."

Kayden chitters happily.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "I strengthen my Self."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "But you stand around those that would cut His faithful down."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "My own transgressions have been purely to protect them, save the Congregant that now wanders Dis."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says to Kayden, in Akrabi, "Do you have His blessing on this Path, friend?"

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "All I do, is a prayer. I have given up everything, in order to serve."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "A final gift, yet more proof, before I am on my way."

Sarciossis clicks.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "You question if this power comes from within? Allow me to demonstrate such a thing."

Kayden bows his head in concentration, then suddenly he is surrounded by brilliant multicoloured lights that wrap around him and soak into his body.

Kayden&#39;s body disintegrates and a ghostly spirit rises from the ashes. You watch in amazement as the ghost cries out in pain as a body forms around him that has gnarled, decrepit appendages and a jewel encrusted forehead and is covered with domed, bald skull.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "Realitly itself is now subject to my will."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "Some would argue that it is being perverted to your will."

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance asks Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "We have long known the foolishness of men, old friend, have we not?"

Emeren looks at Kayden: He is a clever Demon Lord.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "I am finished with this conversation. Allow me, next time, to offer you glimpses of what else I have acquired."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "I do not doubt his ability, nor have I ever."

You say, in Akrabi, "He knows that he knows more about His ways then both of us, thus easily can mix his subtle taint."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "The true question is: Pride or faith? Does the Lord condone his actions? Is the pursuit of Self something that allows us to do what he has done?"

You say, in Akrabi, "The Self turned into himself, into selfishness for power."

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "True."

Sarciossis clicks.

Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "I shall have to think upon his actions."

You say, in Akrabi, "He can control demons because he himself can turn into one at will it seems."

Sarciossis has writhed free of his entanglement by ropes.

You nod your head.
You say, "I'm here."

Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I can leave..."
You say, "You are fine."

You purse your lips contemplatively.
Lemuela snaps her head up suddenly.
Lemuela purses her lips contemplatively.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "....do you remember the dreams I used to have?"
Lemuela creases her brow in a frown.
You ask, in Akrabi, "The nightmares?"
Lemuela nods slowly.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "A great darkness that blotted out the light..."
You nod slowly.
You say, "I remember."
Lemuela gives a pained sigh.
You tilt your head curiously.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "....wish I knew to have warned..."
You raise an eyebrow questioningly.
You ask, "Warned?"
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Had I known the nightmares were of all this I could have done something. Maybe stopped the Onyx from leaving."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Duister sent me to find information on the tainted forest, but even then I couldn't find the meaning in time."
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "She is a fool."
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "She gives herself too much credit, Idrasi. This is a lethal flaw in a lesser being."
Lemuela creases her brow in a frown.
Lemuela sighs deeply, turning to face the entryway.
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "You speak of Lemuela being foolish? What she is spouting is nonesense."
You ask, in Akrabi, "Leaving?"
Lemuela shrugs helplessly.
Lemuela slumps down dejectedly.
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Aye."
Lemuela whispers softly over her shoulder in your direction, "He has come to me, Faithful".
You say, in Akrabi, "I do know the Marble walks with His truefavour. He is not silent."
You have emoted: Emeren narrows his eyes warily, standing still as he surveys the room.
Lemuela shakes her head.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "In my mind."
You say, in Akrabi, "What is that demon saying? Speak!"
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "That she would call Him silent because He does not speak to her? Arrogant beyond acceptability. Nonsense."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I grow exhausted under his magick and when I sleep the nightmares begin again, but in them it is I who join him. I am the darkness."
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "There is nothing forcing you to speak to her, however."
Lemuela turns to you with an expression of weariness.
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "This is foolishness, I feel dimwitted by her very presence."
You give a pained sigh.
You ask, in Akrabi, "Do you feel tainted?"
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I was the first to reach out to him after his betrayal. I sought to redeem him and now he entices me to join him."
Lemuela shakes her head.
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "I did no such thing. She is unworth my time and attention."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I feel weary from battle."
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "She is not prepare for the strength I have gained."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Perhaps the Marble was right.....my compassion is my greatest weakness."
You ask, in Akrabi, "He entices you with what?"
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Clever."
Lemuela rubs her eyes tiredly.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Trying to stay awake..."
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Thank you my friend. I enjoy the art of manipulation."
You say, in Akrabi, "Sleep."
Lemuela shakes her head.
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "You'd do well to recall we share no bond of 'friendship', Idrasi."
You say, in Akrabi, "I will not be distrubed again."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You would throw me into the land of nightmares so easily?"
Lemuela rubs her eyes tiredly.
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "You should know what I mean when I say that now."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You asked what he intices with..."
You say, in Akrabi, "I can knock you out, ending the problem of dreams."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Visions of power. Unbridled power to match the Divine. Vengeance. Cold vengeance in unleashing such devastating darkness across the enemy that one could destroy our enemies armies."
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Interesting what she says."
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "She merely recalls what I demonstrated, not what I offered. She is unworthy."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "There would be no more enemies of the Light. All who defy Him would be destroyed instantly in a wall of darkness. Think of it, Faithful. The shrines you hate so greatly exploding violently by power unleashed by you."
You slap Lemuela on the cheek.
Lemuela gives a horrified gasp.
Lemuela blinks.
You say, in Akrabi, "Snap out of it."
Lemuela blinks.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Wh...why did you just hit me?"
You say, in Akrabi, "Don't get bent out of shape for me hitting you. Marble has driven her sitara through my left hand."
Lemuela rubs the side of her face gently, blinking back tears.
You say, in Akrabi, "Obviously the last part was pure nonesense."
Lemuela blinks.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You hit me because I refused to sleep?"
You say, in Akrabi, "No, you are not listening."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You said the last part."
You say, in Akrabi, "Of what you spoke to me right before I hit you."
Lemuela nods slowly.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Aye....of not wanting to sleep..."
You exclaim, in Akrabi, "You were asking me to join the tainted!"
Lemuela blinks.
"What?" Lemuela asks curiously.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Excuse me?"
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order exclaims, "I said I was having nightmares of being tainted, not that I really was!"
Lemuela blinks once, slowly, then collapses on the ground, suddenly fallen into a deep sleep.Lemuela's eyes close suddenly as she falls asleep.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Alright, alright, knock me out then."
You quietly step up behind Lemuela, bringing the pommel of your sitara to bear and cracking it across the base of her skull in one deft movement.
Kayden tells you, "You are on your own for now, Idrasi. My focus is required elsewhere."
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Fine."
Lemuela rubs her eyes tiredly.
Lemuela rubs the back of her head at the large knot forming.
You say, "You might need to rub some restoration for that."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Apologies if me mentioning my nightmares offended you, Faithful."
Lemuela nods her head.
Lemuela rubs some salve on her head.
"Ooowwwww!", Lemuela whines.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Burns."
Emeren clears his throught and begins to quote, ""There would be no more enemies of the Light. All who defy Him would be destroyed instantly in a wall of darkness. Think of it, Faithful. The shrines you hate so greatly exploding violently by power unleashed by you."".
Lemuela twitches spasmodically.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Who said that?"
Coldly, you say to Lemuela, "You did."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Nay, that's impossible. It's almost identical to what Kayden said to me as he killed Council members. Well except the shrine part."
Lemuela spits on the ground in disgust.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He believes he still is His Onyx. That the Lord commands him to smite our enemies through strengthening his body with the new powers."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He's gone into madness."
Lemuela curls her lip and sneers arrogantly.
You say, "Do not doubt what I say! I know what came from your mouth, do not call me a liar."
Lemuela cautiously looks at you, backing away slightly.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Faithful....are you possibly hearing things?"
Lemuela gulps nervously.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He has the power to be with the wind now. He can whisper such words in the ears of those he chooses to join in madness."
You say, "Do not get coy with me."
Lemuela gives you a concerned look.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I am only concerned, Faithful."
You say, "I just quoted back what you said to me, why I hit you."
(Order): You say, "Can I get your counsel on this matter, Duister?"
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Those are words not to be taken lightly and to accuse me, one of His most loyal that I have taken the Oath of Celibacy of using such words is.....
blasphemy."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "You are still bitter of me to say such hateful things."
You say, "I have moved on, I hold no resentment."
Lemuela raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I can see by your accusation that you haven't."
You say, "Did I say I was accusing you? You say that."
Lemuela gives a pained sigh.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I am tired. It takes little these days for me to grow very tired. If not the nightmares in which he comes, then the whispers when I least expect
it."
You say, "Ignore him."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I am....trying..."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Though I wonder at times how much a person could stand in the darkness before going insane."
You say, "Maybe you should seek a medicine doctor and find something to make you sleep without dreaming."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Aye, I think I shall."
Lemuela cringes pathetically.
You say, "And alert me when you hear him whispering in your head."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He whispers now."
You say, "There is safety in numbers, being alone is tough to overcome."
You ask, "What is he saying?"
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I...I am not allowed to speak unless my blood is spilt often."
You have emoted: With great annoyance, Emeren quickly grabs hold of her finger, and quickly slices the flesh. A thin trickle of blood oozes out from the wound.
"Ouch!", Lemuela shrieks in pain.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I meant he'll kill me over and over if I say anything."
Lemuela sucks on her finger angrily looking at you.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "First you slap me, then you cut me? Accuse me of speaking words of darkness?"
You say, "The Light does not give in to the tainted. They are the weaker ones, not you."
(Order): You say, "Come here now, Faithful."
Lemuela gulps nervously.
You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, "Dealing with Lemuela issue."
Sarciossis arrives from the southwest.
Sarciossis nods his head at you politely.
You say to Sarciossis, "Hail, Faithful."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to you, "He says the Lord knew....all along Him and Duister knew."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says to you, "Tidings, brother."
Lemuela inclines her head, piously clasping her hands before her and bows to Sarciossis respectfully.
Sarciossis tells you, "What's going on?"
You ask, "Knew what?"
Sarciossis clicks.
You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, "Just observe and ask your own questions."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "About the darkness. Everything with the Redwoods. That His Hand would go into the darkness because he could never hide his intentions from Him. So He had to know."
You ask, "Is he still inside your head?"
Lemuela nods slowly.
You give a pained sigh.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He says it is written in blood. Blood that was forged in the Garden. That his destiny is absolute."
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, "Do you hear this?"
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Curious girl, Idrasi. Though I cannot say I find your where your interest in her stems from. She is so frail. So... damaged."
Lemuela gives you a concerned look.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Could it be?"
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Who is he?"
Sarciossis clicks.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Kayden."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "I have nightmares of darkness. I had them before all of this. That a great darkness would eclipse the light. I told Faithful Emeren of them."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Then all of this happened and now I have nightmares where I am in the darkness."
You say, in Akrabi, "She spoke to me, or rather Kayden did through her."
You say, in Akrabi, "I am not sure still."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "What exactly did I say?"
Lemuela blinks.
Sarciossis ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to Sarciossis, "I honestly do not remember saying anything of the sort."
You say, in Akrabi, "I can still quote again."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Kayden is informing you that he was instructed to go into the Redwoods, or Stavenn?"
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He was instructed to join the darkness."
Sarciossis clicks.
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Instructed? No. The child is a babbling fool. I merely led her to the obvious conclusion that He was aware."
You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, in Akrabi, "Do you see my problem?"
Sarciossis ponders a demonic lamia's profile, wondering if it would make a suitable subject for a portrait.
Sarciossis tells you, "Of trusting her word, or kayden's?"
A dove comes flying into the room, deposits a letter into your hands, warbles cheerfully, and flies away.
You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, in Akrabi, "Her word."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He says the Lord knew what he was going to do and allowed it."
You read what is written on an elegant white letter: Adanedhel is phased at your spot.
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Why is the Crux Shade phased here?"
Sarciossis tells you, "She is speaking to him, that is true enough."
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "I have no affiliations to such people."
Sarciossis tells you, "As far as the truth of his words? He is a misguided and foolish man who dwells upon his own pride."
Lemuela enacts the Rite of Piety, declaring that all must be bound by her faith in the God of Light.
Lemuela lays down a spiritual seance, calling on the God of Light to expose those who might reside on an alternate plane of being.
You have emoted: Emeren clears his throught and begins to quote, ""There would be no more enemies of the Light. All who defy Him would be destroyed instantly in a wall of darkness. Think of it, Faithful. The shrines you hate so greatly exploding violently by power unleashed by you."".
You say, in Akrabi, "She told me that to me earlier."
Sarciossis tells you, "It is not beyond Kayden to claim that he was sent by the One Above."
You tell Sarciossis Wurmsdottr, in Akrabi, "Need to seperate lies from truth."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to Sarciossis, "I don't remember it, honest. I even suggested maybe it's possible he whispered it to the Faithful? Or giving illusions?"
Sai Kayden arrives from the ether.
Kayden raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Lemuela spits on the ground in disgust.
Sarciossis clicks.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Now, child, what have you to say?"
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Betrayer. This is His holy place. Be gone or be smited."
Sarciossis taps his foot with mild impatience.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Do not tempt my blade, Idrasi. You and I are both aware of the outcome."
Lemuela falls back into a defensive stance, mace held close.
Kayden smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Sarciossis looks up into the air for divine inspiration.
Kayden's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Sarciossis points accusingly at Kayden.
Sarciossis nods his head.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "I am doing as commanded. He instructs to grow. To gain power. To strengthen. I am doing that. My sacrifices will come to be revered. Mark it."
You spit on the ground in disgust.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "He would never command such and as His former Hand you know it to be true."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Gaining power by casting yourself into the dark heart of those new Redwoods?"
Sarciossis clicks.
You say, in Akrabi, "This is merely a shadow, a copy, a doppleganger."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "You would prefer my physical presence, Idrasi? Consider your reply carefully, then."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Such power is to be gained at a lofty price, old friend."
Lemuela looks up at Sarciossis quickly.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says to Sarciossis, "You were old friends?"
You say, in Akrabi, "I am aware of where his newfound strength comes from."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Some would argue too close."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Of course. It takes a man of strength to obtain it without losing himself to it. I will mince no words, there. It is, however, why I have not taken
others with me."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "The depth of Faith required for this endeavor is... staggering."
You say, in Akrabi, "To kayden heh."
You give a pained sigh.
Kayden smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Faith, or pride, old friend?"
Sarciossis clicks.
You say to Kayden, in Akrabi, "You are too amused."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "I yet await your reply, Idrasi. As to whether you prefer my physical being?"
Kayden raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "The Marble tells me differently. She said you begged her to join with you and spilled her blood when she refused."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "Faith. In all things, Faith. You should know this better than any, Folklorist."
Kayden reaches out and clenches a fist before Lemuela, who screams and doubles over in agony as her skin suddenly bubbles with gangrenous growths.
Lemuela gives a horrified gasp.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "I did not ask for argument, child."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Nay, but you receive truth instead...."
Lemuela coughs softly.
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Such is the Light. Remember it well, former Hand."
A rumbling is suddenly heard in the distance, followed by a violent crackling of energy all around you.
Sarciossis clicks.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, "You are excused from this conversation, Cleric. Your next words will be your last."
Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "Your words fill my head with filth. You have dragged me into this darkness and I will stay until Light shines once again."
Kayden utters a short incantation, his body slowly fading from sight. Only his laboured breathing warns you of his presence, and in seconds even this grows muffled and silent.
Lemuela steps back, raising her mace.

Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "A shame."
The soul of Apothecary Lemuela, Deacon of the First Order says, "And the Light dims..."
Kayden clicks.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance asks, in Akrabi, "Now then. A civilized conversation?"
Kayden tilts his head curiously.
You say to Kayden, in Akrabi, "You have my attention."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says to Kayden, "What words were spoken that put you upon this path into the wilderness, friend?"
The wall of stone to the north suddenly collapses under its own massive weight.
Kayden point a stone figurine to the north and a stone wall rumbles out of the ground.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "I found myself unable to grow, aye? I had reached the peak of what was possible in my current form."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "A relentless pursuit of excellence, old friend. Anything less... is heresy."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, "Power offered by demons is power obtained at a grand price."
Kayden shakes his head.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "The power is from within, as it always has been."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance asks Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "A... less abrasive... demonstration, perhaps?"
Kayden tilts his head curiously.
You ask, in Akrabi, "You control them to submit to your will?"
A demonic hound sniffs the air for a moment, then lets loose an unearthly howl.
The demon hound explodes into a fury of claws and teeth, rending your flesh.
You growl menacingly.
Kayden smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Kayden whispers something to a demonic hound. A demonic hound seems to settle down.
Kayden barks at a soulmaster, ordering it to attack you.
A soulmaster entity lets loose a horrible scream as a stream of primal darkness flows from it and into your very being.
Kayden whispers something to a soulmaster.
A soulmaster seems to settle down. A stream of primal darkness flows out of your being.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to you, in Akrabi, "I do."
You say, in Akrabi, "And you planted a seed inside of me."
Sarciossis clicks.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to you, in Akrabi, "If so, I cannot recall."
You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.
You say, in Akrabi, "You calmed it."
Comprehension flashes across your face.
Kayden's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to you, in Akrabi, "My word, as my destiny, is absolute. It is law."
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "Only a Sith deals with absolutes!"
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance asks you, in Akrabi, "Did I not just prove such? Did I not just punish a Congregant, as two Priests dared not overturn my Judgement?"
Kayden tilts his head and listens intently.
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "Strength of might does not mean truth."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "Perhaps it is clear, even as you deny it vocally, that you are each aware of who and what I truly am, aye? Perhaps, though you dare not speak it, you are wholly aware that I am far progressed along the path towards the Light."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Kayden, in Akrabi, "Away."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to you, in Akrabi, "Again. Absolute control."
Kayden's deadly tail sways slowly behind him.
You say, in Akrabi, "So I see."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "I do believe you have grown in power, but I am not sure if it is down the True Path."
You nod your acknowledgement of Kayden.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "There is but one path, according to Him. The path of the Self. Nothing else is relevant."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "If I grow strong, I feed the Self. If I come awash in the blood of the fallen, I feed the Self. If I stand before those who hate Him, and cut them down."
Kayden chitters happily.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "I strengthen my Self."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "But you stand around those that would cut His faithful down."
You say, in Akrabi, "She is not Faithful."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "No harm has befallen them that has not been my hand."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to you, in Akrabi, "That is not your judgement to make, Idrasi."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "My own transgressions have been purely to protect them, save the Congregant that now wanders Dis."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says to Kayden, in Akrabi, "Do you have His blessing on this Path, friend?"
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "All I do, is a prayer. I have given up everything, in order to serve."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "A final gift, yet more proof, before I am on my way."
Sarciossis clicks.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says to Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "You question if this power comes from within? Allow me to demonstrate such a thing."
Kayden bows his head in concentration, then suddenly he is surrounded by brilliant multicoloured lights that wrap around him and soak into his body.
Kayden's body disintegrates and a ghostly spirit rises from the ashes. You watch in amazement as the ghost cries out in pain as a body forms around him that has gnarled, decrepit appendages and a jewel encrusted forehead and is covered with domed, bald skull.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "Realitly itself is now subject to my will."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "Some would argue that it is being perverted to your will."
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance asks Sarciossis, in Akrabi, "We have long known the foolishness of men, old friend, have we not?"
Emeren looks at Kayden: He is a clever Demon Lord.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "I am finished with this conversation. Allow me, next time, to offer you glimpses of what else I have acquired."
Kayden inclines his head respectfully.
Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance says, in Akrabi, "Blood."
Kayden shoots off into the distance, taken to a faraway place by a pathfinder demon entity.
Sarciossis clicks.
You say, in Akrabi, "He is a Demon Lord."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "True."
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "You may wish to verify such things before speaking them."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "He sought power, and now has it."
You tell Sai Kayden Bellor, Defiled Vengeance, in Akrabi, "He is a clever Demon Lord."
Kayden tells you, in Akrabi, "Again. Verify things before speaking them."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "I do not doubt his ability, nor have I ever."
You say, in Akrabi, "He knows that he knows more about His ways then both of us, thus easily can mix his subtle taint."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "The true question is: Pride or faith? Does the Lord condone his actions? Is the pursuit of Self something that allows us to do what he has done?"
You say, in Akrabi, "The Self turned into himself, into selfishness for power."
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "True."
Sarciossis clicks.
Sarciossis Wurmsdottr says, in Akrabi, "I shall have to think upon his actions."
You say, in Akrabi, "He can control demons because he himself can turn into one at will it seems."
Sarciossis has writhed free of his entanglement by ropes.
Sarciossis leaves to the southwest.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 4 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3deeb5eefd3c9dae35b8f93076b4cec?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by alextelecan@xxx on 15Â Nov 2011</p><p>Emeren, you clearly bark up the wrong tree with your roleplay.</p><p>For one, you shouldn&rsquo;t have a conversation with Kayden as a follower of Illuminas, you should kill him or die trying.
