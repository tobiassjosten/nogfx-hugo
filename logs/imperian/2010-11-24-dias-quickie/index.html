Along the West circle, near the residential wall. (City of Kinsarmar.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. 
Walking along the street, you can't help but notice the towers towering on 
either side. A road of smooth marble seems to be well traveled, by citizen and 
guard alike noticeable by the slight flaws in the otherwise perfect marble. The
road is artificially lit by Mages where subtle stones glow a faint yellow, 
creating an artificial light even in the darkest of hours. The massive wall 
here appears more than defensible, yet it is not the Curam'Nathariel, instead 
they appear to be of a higher quality, more artistic stonework here. The walls 
of the residential section seem to meet with those of the Curam'Nathariel, 
completely encompassing the area from outside influences. The walls appear 
carved with a massive bas-relief design, intricately looping and repeating to 
make a simply breath-taking and artistic sense to the rather otherwise 
militaristic edifice of the city. There are 2 eye sigils here. A sigil in the 
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. General Dias 
Tethe'alla, Archmagus of Fire is here, surrounded by a aura of black flames. He
wields Sabre of the Magi in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading north and south.

Along the West circle, near the residential wall. (City of Kinsarmar.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. There
are 2 eye sigils here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is
on the ground. There are 2 large walls of ice here. The decaying remains of
Dias lie here. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. A headless
corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. A headless corpse, devoid of identity,
lies here. Audible sounds of quacking reverberate from a wood duck here. Tongue
flicking out rapidly a black-spotted anaconda slithers around here. A dark crow
perches nearby, glaring at your every move. Large front teeth chatter from a
restless beaver here. An anteater plods about bristling angrily. Preening her
wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. Incredibly large and a rare
white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and
aloofness. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A
young rat cautiously noses about for food here. A full-grown rat prowls near
your feet. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you.
Victor, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the surroundings with a miasma of
fear. Cadeyrn, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the surroundings with a
miasma of fear. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a tower shield
in his right. Blood Warrior Palandrias Eruanna is here. He wields a gladiator's
trident in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Zerin Arkadis, the
Inferno is riding on a large red kangaroo named Warroo. She wields a cruelly
spiked white tower shield in her left hand and a mace wreathed in holy flames
in her right.
