cinders here. There are 2 bloodied and mangled arms here. There are 2 mortal 
hearts here. The burnt remnant of someone&#39;s ear lies on the ground. Smoke 
issues from this mutilated leg, the skin peeled back by scorching heat. The 
shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A noble kestrel 
is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you. A charred and bloodied chunk of 
someone&#39;s head lies here, mostly just skullcap. Little more than a stumpy 
digit, a gnarled finger lies severed from its hand. Garryn is here, wreathed in
divine fire. Knight Commander Zexo Bercalion is riding on an armoured battle 
stallion. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a tower shield in his
