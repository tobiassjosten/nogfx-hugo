Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A dark sphere rests on
a spike of obsidian that erupts from the bloodied springs that gush forth from 
the ruins in a fountain, a grey mist hovers over its surface, slowly shifting 
and billowing. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, 
depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue 
of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A plain metal chest rests
upon the ground here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here 
depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A 
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an 
ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean 
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble 
foam about its mouth. A bench made from old, overly used weapons and armour has
been placed here. A small sign points into a market stall. The shrunken head of
Dias has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still 
visible upon his face. A great horned owl is perched here, gazing coldly at his
surroundings. Barely registering your presence, a stealthy cougar stalks the 
area. The shrunken head of Draven has been staked into the ground here, the 
last torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Tiala 
has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible 
upon her face. A partially-burnt letter has been left here carelessly. Tomast 
the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The shining figure of a
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A demon resembling a swamp loig idly 
paces here. Fangs dripping with what could only be fresh blood, a shadowy 
figure of a hound stands here. A fearless Shaahri stallion trots about. Katsuma
Tokugawa is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual 
mace in his right. Harbinger Clark Lokrien, Arm of Death is here, giving off a 
truly ghastly stench. He is rapidly swinging a sword above his head.

the ruins in a fountain, a grey mist hovers over its surface, slowly shifting

dripping with what could only be fresh blood, a shadowy figure of a hound 
stands here. Katsuma Tokugawa is here. He wields a tower shield in his left 
hand and a spiritual mace in his right. Harbinger Clark Lokrien, Arm of Death

his left hand and a boomerang drenched with blood in his right.

are 3 Icy Justices here. Quite difficult to make out, a ghost floats above the 
ground here, moaning to itself. A fearless Shaahri stallion trots about. A 
noble falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding you watchfully. A 
shaggy bull stands here, immovable as a boulder. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Fangs dripping with what could only 
be fresh blood, a shadowy figure of a hound stands here. The towering presence 
of Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate the room here. Katsuma Tokugawa
is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his 
right. Harbinger Clark Lokrien, Arm of Death is here, sprawled on the ground. 
He wields a malignant battleaxe in each hand.

The empty eastern square. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. There 
are 3 Icy Justices here. Quite difficult to make out, a ghost floats above the 
ground here, moaning to itself. A fearless Shaahri stallion trots about. A 
noble falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding you watchfully. A 
shaggy bull stands here, immovable as a boulder. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Fangs dripping with what could only 
be fresh blood, a shadowy figure of a hound stands here. The towering presence 
of Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate the room here. Katsuma Tokugawa
is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his 
right. Harbinger Clark Lokrien, Arm of Death is here, sprawled on the ground. 
He wields a malignant battleaxe in each hand.
You see exits leading east, southwest, west, and northwest.

Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A dark sphere rests on
a spike of obsidian that erupts from the bloodied springs that gush forth from
the ruins in a fountain, a grey mist hovers over its surface, slowly shifting
and billowing. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here,
depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue
of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A plain metal chest rests
upon the ground here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here
depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an
ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble
foam about its mouth. A bench made from old, overly used weapons and armour has
been placed here. A small sign points into a market stall. The shrunken head of
Dias has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still
visible upon his face. A great horned owl is perched here, gazing coldly at his
surroundings. Barely registering your presence, a stealthy cougar stalks the
area. The shrunken head of Draven has been staked into the ground here, the
last torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Tiala

the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The shining figure of a
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A demon resembling a swamp loig idly
paces here. Fangs dripping with what could only be fresh blood, a shadowy
figure of a hound stands here. A fearless Shaahri stallion trots about. Katsuma
Tokugawa is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A dark sphere rests on
a spike of obsidian that erupts from the bloodied springs that gush forth from
the ruins in a fountain, a grey mist hovers over its surface, slowly shifting
and billowing. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here,
depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue
of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A plain metal chest rests
upon the ground here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here
depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an
ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble
foam about its mouth. A bench made from old, overly used weapons and armour has
been placed here. A small sign points into a market stall. The shrunken head of
Dias has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still
visible upon his face. A great horned owl is perched here, gazing coldly at his
surroundings. Barely registering your presence, a stealthy cougar stalks the
area. The shrunken head of Draven has been staked into the ground here, the
last torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Tiala
has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible
upon her face. A partially-burnt letter has been left here carelessly. Tomast
the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The shining figure of a
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A feral demon has been slain and left
here to rot. A noble falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding you
watchfully. A shaggy bull stands here, immovable as a boulder. Fangs dripping
with what could only be fresh blood, a shadowy figure of a hound stands here. A
stray cat wanders around here, searching the ground for food. Hands of rotting
flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Katsuma Tokugawa is here, rubbing
his chin thoughtfully. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a
spiritual mace in his right.
