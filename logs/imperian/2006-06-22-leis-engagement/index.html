You ponder the situation.

You say, "I don&#39;t know any people that I want to die."

You say, "So that doesn&#39;t do me any good."

Kephas purses his lips, deep in thought.

"Oh?" you exclaim quizzically.

Kephas Bezaliel asks, "Ya?"

She is a tanari human and is small in stature. Her dark almond eyes are set into a delicately structured face. Long raven hair is braided severely down her back and held in place with a silver clasp. A large fire opal decorates the center of the clasp, bright rainbow hues contrasting strikingly against the backdrop of ebon tresses. Her voice, when she speaks, has a slightly raspy quality to it. She is wearing an emerald green leather pack, a provocative black silk corset, and a dried, dead flower. She is holding a pike in her right hand.

You say, "I like fire opals."

You nod your acknowledgement of yourself.

Kephas Bezaliel says, "I don&#39;t know."

Kephas Bezaliel says, "My truths aren&#39;t found there."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Kephas Bezaliel says, "What He used to teach me, and what it used to be.. I&#39;ll always remember."

Kephas Bezaliel says, "What if I become tired.."

You say, "Well, that&#39;s different."

Kephas Bezaliel says, "I never knew reproducing with you would mean I couldn&#39;t be tired."

Kephas purses his lips, deep in thought.

Kephas Bezaliel grabs Leilani&#39;s hand, standing up to his feet, as if making her follow.

You ponder the situation. 

Leilani pokes you gently to see if you are truly asleep.
You ponder the situation.

Leilani picks up your hand, and bites down on your little 
finger, chewing on the tip for a moment before grimacing and dropping it again.

You give Kephas the once-over, eyeing him suspiciously.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "No, no. No. It wasn't my choice, no."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I was a great warrior, there to. Yes.. I think ah, I think I was a differnt person there."
Kephas looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
You say, "If we do make spawn, you will have to teach them that, then."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Yes, yes."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Cook I can, too. Learned as a warden!"
Kephas Bezaliel frowns and says, "Only know how to make rabbits over a campfire, though.."
You say, "Oh good. I can't."
You say, "I can write and play with books though."
You give a thick, musty tome a friendly cuddle.
Kephas Bezaliel asks, "We will make many, yes?"
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Big family.."
Kephas Bezaliel makes a large gesture with his hands.
You say, "I think so."
You say, "I like family."
Kephas gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.
You peer at Kephas unscrupulously.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Glad I am that those things don't come out of my..area.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Yes..."
You say, "We can always try?"
You rub your hands together as an evil grin creeps across your face.
Kephas Bezaliel says to you, "If, ah... if."
Kephas Bezaliel says to you, "If I think, or ponder.. or have a thought of anything.. concerning you and another man."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I'll ah.. I'll do things that aren't nice."
Kephas glares about himself, upset with the world.
You stare about, completely confused.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "You know.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Another man trying to do this, yes."
Kephas grabs protectively at you.
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth.
You say, "No, no worries there."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Good good."
Kephas peers about himself unscrupulously.
Kephas shuffles some cards with the image of Lust out of his deck.
Kephas rubs his fingers briskly on a Tarot card.
Kephas gives a tarot card inscribed with Lust (glowing) to you.
You pat a tarot card inscribed with Lust in a friendly manner.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I am to give you some expensive rock, or some such."
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth.
Kephas Bezaliel asks, "Ya?"
She is a tanari human and is small in stature. Her dark almond eyes are set into a delicately structured face. Long raven hair is braided severely down her back and held in place with a silver clasp. A large fire opal decorates the center of the clasp, bright rainbow hues contrasting strikingly against the backdrop of ebon tresses. Her voice, when she speaks, has a slightly raspy quality to it. She is wearing an emerald green leather pack, a provocative black silk corset, and a dried, dead flower. She is holding a pike in her right hand.
You say, "I like fire opals."
You nod your acknowledgement of yourself.
Leilani points to the clasp in her hair.
Kephas Bezaliel asks, "What about ICE opals?"
You ponder the situation.
You say, "Is there such a thing?"
Kephas looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Well."
Kephas Bezaliel asks, "How abouts I simply give you the gold to make your own?"
Kephas Bezaliel asks, "Makes more sense, no or yes?"
Kephas Bezaliel says, "And then ah.."
You ponder the situation.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I make for you something spiffy when we do that.. ritual of unity."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Before we reproduce."
You say, "Alright."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "How..ah.."
Kephas peers about himself unscrupulously.
Kephas Bezaliel looks around at the ground.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "You know.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I once ate a frog.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "However.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Ah.."
Kephas creases his brow in grim determination at you.
Kephas gets down on one knee and, while holding forth some gold sovereigns, declares his eternal love for you, and asks you to marry him. Type AGREE if you will agree to marry him.
You joyfully accept Kephas's proposal of marriage, and his gift of some gold sovereigns.
Kephas Bezaliel exclaims, "So it is done!"
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth.
You say, "What do we do now?"
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Well.. we wait."
You say, "Okay."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "And then wait some more."
You ponder the situation.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "And then we get some person to say a few words."
Kephas Bezaliel exclaims, "And then we reproduce!"
You give a mischievous grin.
Kephas shuffles over to you and shyly takes your hand in his own.
You run up to Kephas and envelop him in a massive bearhug.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Something to say."
Kephas nods his head.
Kephas sits down.
Kephas Bezaliel pats the ground next to him.
You tilt your head curiously.
Kephas Bezaliel exclaims, "Sit!"
You sit yourself down.
You blink.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "About Lord Malkav.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "That is what."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "The congregation and order.. it.. it is not what it was. It doesn't..ah.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I don't know."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "My truths aren't found there."
You crease your brow in a frown.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "What He used to teach me, and what it used to be.. I'll always remember."
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth.
You say, "You can only find your truths yourself."
You say, "Nobody else can do so for you."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Yes.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I find a Truth in you.."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Perhaps.. one in a differnt God."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Too."
You ponder the situation.
You nod your head.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "Malkav, he changed me. Expect I will for all our spawn to honor Him for what he is, Always."
You say, "Good."
You nod your acknowledgement of yourself.
You say, "They will know, they will see."
Kephas looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Kephas Bezaliel fakes an enormous yawn, stretching his arms out, and letting one drop around Leilani's shoulders.
Kephas waggles his eyebrows comically.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I saw that somewhere, once."
You smirk at Kephas.
You say, "I think that the..."
You say, "Thing you did."
Kephas tilts his head curiously.
You say, "Means you don't have to yawn anymore."
You brandish some gold sovereigns menacingly.
"Oh?" Kephas exclaims quizzically.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "What if I become tired.."
You say, "Well, that's different."
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I never knew reproducing with you would mean I couldn't be tired."
Kephas purses his lips, deep in thought.
Kephas Bezaliel grabs Leilani's hand, standing up to his feet, as if making her follow.
Kephas stands up from the ground.
You stand up from the ground.
You begin to follow Kephas.
-walking-
You follow Kephas to the up. (following)
Filand's Upstairs Bar. (City of Stavenn.)
Kephas closes the door to the down.
Kephas peers about himself unscrupulously.
Kephas Bezaliel says, "I have to rest.. make sure nobody eats me."
Kephas closes his eyes, curls up into a ball and falls asleep.
You ponder the situation.
Leilani pokes you gently to see if you are truly asleep.
You ponder the situation.
Leilani picks up your hand, and bites down on your little
finger, chewing on the tip for a moment before grimacing and dropping it again.
Kephas opens his eyes and stretches languidly, a smile on his face.
Kephas gives you a nod of acknowledgement.
You say, "I have to go now. Nobody will eat you."
You mutter, "You .on't tas.. ..od."
You cough softly.
Kephas peers at you unscrupulously.
You wave goodbye.
Kephas shakes his head.
Kephas kisses you gently on the lips.
Kephas waves goodbye at you.
Kephas Bezaliel looks at his finger.
You kiss Kephas gently on the lips.
You smile your sweetest, most innocent smile.
You grow still and begin to silently pray for preservation of your soul while
you are out of the land.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
