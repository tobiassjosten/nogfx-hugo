(Stavenn): Alaia says, \"So. Those wishing to assist in smearing the filthy 
blood of Kinsarmarians along their own City walls are to come prepared to the 
Gates and be ready for a ring invite.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Leisane says, \"What is the reason for this raid, beyond personal 
revenge for the deaths in Kenuba?\"

(Stavenn): Bronstal says, \"Do we need reasons to kill scum??\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Alaia says, \"Aside from killing a novice of our own?\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Kriz says, \"They are scum, and deserve to be slain for the glory of 
the Empire.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): You say, \"Wasn\&#39;t there a raid on Kinsarmar earlier? I remember 
seeing people dying to mage guards.\"

(Stavenn): Alaia says, \"No, no recent raids.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Leisane says, \"I recall that as well. What was that, if not a raid?\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Bronstal says, \"That was some one getting lost.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Alaia says, \"The wrong route taken on a hunting trip.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Verick says, \"So you\&#39;re getting revenge because you were stupid?\"

(Stavenn): Alaia says, \"Uh, no.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Bronstal says, \"No they came out and killed us after we explained to
them we weren\&#39;t attacking and they killed one of our novices..\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): You say, \"They wandered into Kinsarmar earlier in the month. More 
recently, there was an attack in Kenuba and a Recruit in the hunting party - 
the one who is sounding so vehement now about killing scum, I believe - was 
killed.\"

Alaia lost a head to the blade of Leisane.
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Leisane says, \"That is what I think of disrespectful replies.\"

(Stavenn): Leisane says, \"Give me a solid reason beyond a novice was killed and
your own inability to lead properly to why we should force aggression to 
Kinsarmar?\"

(Stavenn): Aedius says, \"Because it is amusing.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Bronstal says, \"Because we can.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
 (Stavenn): Angelina says, \"It\&#39;s Kinsy?\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Aedius says, \"Because they are weak and we are strong. The world 
must be reminded of this.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Bronstal says, \"You want to look weak that we can\&#39;t take revenge?\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Aedius says, \"Bloodshed for the sake of bloodshed is most 
satisfying.\"

(Stavenn): Angelina says, \"It\&#39;s not about revenge...we should be raiding them 
on a regular schedule just because it amuses us to do so.\"

(Stavenn): Leisane says, \"Given we still have a cease-fire, and we are 
currently forming a war with Antioch, if you wish to kill anyone, turn your 
aggression towards the desert.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Bronstal says, \"There no challenge why bother.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Vaerom says, \"Ephor, simply put, they attack us for trespassing 
their lands..Ok that I can understand but to do so on the Empire\&#39;s doorsteps 
should not be countenanced.\"

(Stavenn): Vaerom says, \"If you order us not to I will stand down though I will
say I am not happy with it, Ephor.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
Your ally, Imperator Sagron Savet, has entered Imperian.

<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): You say, \"Hail, Imperator.\"

<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Alaia says, \"Perhaps you can share your opinion with us on this 
matter.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Leisane says, \"Until we rule otherwise, the city shall not be 
raided. If you see them out, in their territory, as you were, then feel free to
butcher them.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Sagron says, \"What matter? Which city, for that matter?\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Alaia says, \"Kinsarmar.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Sagron says, \"What about it?\"

(Stavenn): Sagron says, \"The Kinsarmarians at no point entered into the city 
itself?\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): You say, \"No, Imperator.\"

(Stavenn): Sagron says, \"Now that the realm appears stable, hear my words.\"
<401/401h 285/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Burt): Verick says, \"You agreed :(.\"
<401/401h 285/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Sagron says, \"I will not have this Empire thrashing about like an 
angry child, lashing out at all those in reach merely because we are so able. 
We are focused on one foe, and one foe above all others.\"
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb>> 
(Stavenn): Vaerom says, \"Be well, Empire.\"

(Stavenn): Sagron says, \"The Kinsamrarians slay you in Kenuba? Demolish them in
their own hunting grounds. Ambush them in Caanae.\"

(Stavenn): Sagron says, \"There will be no shortage of battle soon. For now, the
ceasefire stands.\"

(Stavenn): Sagron says, \"Those are my words, heed them or suffer the 
consequences of disobedience.\"'>**********************************[ Stavenn ]**********************************
