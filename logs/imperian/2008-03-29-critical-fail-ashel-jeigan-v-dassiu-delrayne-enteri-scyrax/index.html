The Panda Gate. (Ruins of n'Aryanvella.)
A massive gate decorated with ivory and ebony pandas dominates this area. 
Nearly engulfed in rambunxious weeds, flowers and vines, the gate exudes a 
quiet reverence that only ancient things can. Trees tower on either side of it 
and high walls stretch out to the north and south, amazingly unravished by time
and whatever destructive force helped to destroy the rest of the city. It is 
impossible to tell from here what lies beyond the huge gate. Inlaid with ivory 
and ebony pandas, an ancient gate towers here. There are 2 savage grey wolves 
here. Commander Jeigan Sol'Anlumaire, Artisan of Lore and Steel is here. He 
wields a brilliant silver-edged broadsword in each hand. A masked man is here. 
He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. 
Enteri is here.
You see a single exit leading west.

The Panda Gate. (Ruins of n'Aryanvella.)

Nearly engulfed in rambunxious weeds, flowers and vines, the gate exudes a 
quiet reverence that only ancient things can. Trees tower on either side of it 
and high walls stretch out to the north and south, amazingly unravished by time
and whatever destructive force helped to destroy the rest of the city. It is 
impossible to tell from here what lies beyond the huge gate. Inlaid with ivory 
and ebony pandas, an ancient gate towers here. There are 2 savage grey wolves 
here. There are 12 corpses of a gray woodchuck here. There are 17 corpses of an

The Panda Gate. (Ruins of n'Aryanvella.)
A massive gate decorated with ivory and ebony pandas dominates this area. 
Nearly engulfed in rambunxious weeds, flowers and vines, the gate exudes a 
quiet reverence that only ancient things can. Trees tower on either side of it 
and high walls stretch out to the north and south, amazingly unravished by time
and whatever destructive force helped to destroy the rest of the city. It is 
impossible to tell from here what lies beyond the huge gate. Inlaid with ivory 
and ebony pandas, an ancient gate towers here. There are 2 savage grey wolves 
here. There are 12 corpses of a gray woodchuck here. There are 17 corpses of an
ironwood chipmunk here. There are 14 corpses of a mottled groundhog here. There
are 23 corpses of a red-backed vole here. There are 4 corpses of a hoary marmot
here. There are 3 corpses of an old rat here. A massive alligator lies here, 
slowly decaying. A dead black rat lies here, the fire in its eyes gone out. 
There are 4 corpses of a baby rat here. There are 2 corpses of a young rat 
here. A dead rat has been left here. There are 4 orphine seeds in 4 groups 
here. A ball of myrrh gum resides here. There are 5 toadstools in 5 groups 
here. There are 3 linseeds in 3 groups here. Twinkling and gleaming, a large 
pile of golden sovereigns rests on the ground. An icewall is here, blocking 
passage to the west. Commander Jeigan Sol'Anlumaire, Artisan of Lore and Steel 
is here. He wields a brilliant silver-edged broadsword in each hand.
You see a single exit leading west.

The Panda Gate. (Ruins of n'Aryanvella.)
A massive gate decorated with ivory and ebony pandas dominates this area.
Nearly engulfed in rambunxious weeds, flowers and vines, the gate exudes a
quiet reverence that only ancient things can. Trees tower on either side of it
and high walls stretch out to the north and south, amazingly unravished by time
and whatever destructive force helped to destroy the rest of the city. It is
impossible to tell from here what lies beyond the huge gate. Inlaid with ivory
and ebony pandas, an ancient gate towers here. There are 2 savage grey wolves
here. Postulant Scyrax Elarien, Fourth Grade is here, sprawled on the ground.
He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
Enteri is here. Commander Jeigan Sol'Anlumaire, Artisan of Lore and Steel is
here, sprawled on the ground. He wields a brilliant silver-edged broadsword in
each hand.
You see a single exit leading west.

The Panda Gate. (Ruins of n'Aryanvella.)
A massive gate decorated with ivory and ebony pandas dominates this area.
Nearly engulfed in rambunxious weeds, flowers and vines, the gate exudes a
quiet reverence that only ancient things can. Trees tower on either side of it
and high walls stretch out to the north and south, amazingly unravished by time
and whatever destructive force helped to destroy the rest of the city. It is
impossible to tell from here what lies beyond the huge gate. Inlaid with ivory
and ebony pandas, an ancient gate towers here. There are 2 savage grey wolves
here. There are 12 corpses of a gray woodchuck here. There are 17 corpses of an
ironwood chipmunk here. There are 14 corpses of a mottled groundhog here. There
are 23 corpses of a red-backed vole here. There are 4 corpses of a hoary marmot
here. There are 3 corpses of an old rat here. A massive alligator lies here,
slowly decaying. A dead black rat lies here, the fire in its eyes gone out.
There are 4 corpses of a baby rat here. There are 2 corpses of a young rat
here. A dead rat has been left here. There are 4 orphine seeds in 4 groups
here. A ball of myrrh gum resides here. There are 5 toadstools in 5 groups
here. The decaying remains of Enteri lie here. There are 3 linseeds in 3 groups
here. Twinkling and gleaming, a large pile of golden sovereigns rests on the
ground. Commander Jeigan Sol'Anlumaire, Artisan of Lore and Steel is here. He
wields a brilliant silver-edged broadsword in each hand.
