[AL] Greggory - west
You are dragged away by Greggory to the west.
At a large pillar. (road).
Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a 
cunning glint of the eye. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers 
under your feet. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. A raven 
the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black 
eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Fluttering
on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A peaceful 
aura fills the area, emanating from Greggory, Aspect of Aryana.
You see exits leading east, southwest, and up.

strikes you soundly on the head.

The weight of this king-sized bed rests upon three pillar-shaped bedposts, 
which taper off into tipless pyramids on both the top and the bottom. The frame
of the bed has been carved into the shape of a heart with one bedpost 
positioned at the tip and the other two at each crest. Up and down the length 
of each redwood bedpost is a series of hearts and roses, each figure inked 
carefully into the wood with a different shade of pink. Resting atop all three 
pillars is a heart-shaped wooden canopy with iridescent red silk curtains 
draped about it on all sides. The fluffy mattress has been stuffed with a 
combination of spun wool and swan down feathers. Four complementary pillows 
have been stitched onto the mattress with two at each crest, encouraging its 
sleepy owners to cuddle close. The bed sheets and pillow cases have been woven 
from baby-soft silk and dyed hot pink with black trim. Built into the underside
of the bed\'s canopy is a heart-shaped mirror, reflecting back all the love it 
sees below.
It weighs about 125 pounds.

You look through the mind of Juganothion:
Water-filled pit.
An icewall is here, blocking passage to the east. Silent and observant, a red 
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. 
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A grumpy 
badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. A raven the colour of night 
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Hackles raised, an
adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Fluttering on delicate wings, a 
huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A peaceful aura fills the area, 
emanating from Greggory, Aspect of Aryana.
You see exits leading north, east, and west.

He is an intelligent Demon Lord. He is a towering figure with a demonic build. 
His once fair skin has toughened from the transformation, almost resembling 
wyrmskin. His face, seeminly setin stone, appears emotionless, except for his 
deepset eyes, of which the irises blaze with the fires of the inferno.  Demonic
wings, leathery in look, span out from his shoulders, almost equal in length to
his actual form.  His hair, typically black, has turned a startling white, with
only a hint of his true color seen in a random strand here and there. Though 
slightly resembling a sidhe, he has elegant ebony horns and a jewel encrusted 
forehead and is covered with deep green flesh. He is wearing a shining ring, a 
ring of pestilence, a deck of Tarot cards, a simple ring of silver, a silver 
crown inlaid with amethysts, 7 pocketbelts, a vermilion viper armband, the 
Periapt of the Vitani, a well-used leather pack, a lucky clover, a Prism Pouch,

Issue #101634   Reported by: Greggory    Re: Juganothion
2011-10-11 23:11:24: 
Abusing the snub command. He sent Greggory \&#34;Sore lose much?\&#34; Then snubbed 
Greggory before he could mention anything else. If his character is going to 
remotely try to insult someone and then snub them afterwards, it shows that it 
is pretty immature on his part and he should be punished.

You are dragged away by Greggory to the west.
At a large pillar. (road).
Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a
cunning glint of the eye. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers
under your feet. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. A raven
the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black
eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Fluttering
on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A peaceful
aura fills the area, emanating from Greggory, Aspect of Aryana.
You see exits leading east, southwest, and up.

The weight of this king-sized bed rests upon three pillar-shaped bedposts,
which taper off into tipless pyramids on both the top and the bottom. The frame
of the bed has been carved into the shape of a heart with one bedpost
positioned at the tip and the other two at each crest. Up and down the length
of each redwood bedpost is a series of hearts and roses, each figure inked
carefully into the wood with a different shade of pink. Resting atop all three
pillars is a heart-shaped wooden canopy with iridescent red silk curtains
draped about it on all sides. The fluffy mattress has been stuffed with a
combination of spun wool and swan down feathers. Four complementary pillows
have been stitched onto the mattress with two at each crest, encouraging its
sleepy owners to cuddle close. The bed sheets and pillow cases have been woven
from baby-soft silk and dyed hot pink with black trim. Built into the underside
of the bed\'s canopy is a heart-shaped mirror, reflecting back all the love it
sees below.
It weighs about 125 pounds.

Water-filled pit.
An icewall is here, blocking passage to the east. Silent and observant, a red
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye.
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A grumpy
badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. A raven the colour of night
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Hackles raised, an
adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Fluttering on delicate wings, a
huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A peaceful aura fills the area,
emanating from Greggory, Aspect of Aryana.

He is an intelligent Demon Lord. He is a towering figure with a demonic build.
His once fair skin has toughened from the transformation, almost resembling
wyrmskin. His face, seeminly setin stone, appears emotionless, except for his
deepset eyes, of which the irises blaze with the fires of the inferno. Demonic
wings, leathery in look, span out from his shoulders, almost equal in length to
his actual form. His hair, typically black, has turned a startling white, with
only a hint of his true color seen in a random strand here and there. Though
slightly resembling a sidhe, he has elegant ebony horns and a jewel encrusted
forehead and is covered with deep green flesh. He is wearing a shining ring, a
ring of pestilence, a deck of Tarot cards, a simple ring of silver, a silver
crown inlaid with amethysts, 7 pocketbelts, a vermilion viper armband, the
Periapt of the Vitani, a well-used leather pack, a lucky clover, a Prism Pouch,

Water-filled pit.
Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a
cunning glint of the eye. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers
under your feet. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. A raven
the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black
eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Fluttering
on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A peaceful
aura fills the area, emanating from Greggory, Aspect of Aryana.
You see exits leading north, east, and west.

Issue #101634 Reported by: Greggory Re: Juganothion
2011-10-11 23:11:24:
Abusing the snub command. He sent Greggory \"Sore lose much?\" Then snubbed
Greggory before he could mention anything else. If his character is going to
remotely try to insult someone and then snub them afterwards, it shows that it
is pretty immature on his part and he should be punished.
