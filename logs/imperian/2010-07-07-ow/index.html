The Drunken Ibex Tavern. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A large barrel of beer stands here. A 
whimsical hammock of midnight blue with dangling moon and star beads rests 
here, swaying gently. A simple chessboard made of wood rests here on a small 
table. Pelt stretched out and mouth agape, a black bear rug has been thrown 
here. Strangely slender, a chair resides near to the wall, crafted of pale wood
and overstuffed padding. Firmly, a carved ironwood chair rests here, bearing 
the form of a lion. A smoky glass phial has been left here. Several green 
leaves still clinging to its stubby stem, a small green apple rests on the 
ground here. Wrapped in a tight bundle, a sheaf of grain lies here. A narrow 
orange capped mushroom has been left here. Marnor the barkeep stands behind the
bar, polishing a mug. His curved horns displayed proudly, this tame ibex 
nibbles at a weed growing nearby. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a 
massive shire stands here poised and alert. A mighty redwood eagle soars 
through the air here, silent as a whisper as its eyes focus upon the ground. A 
white wolf stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey. Ike is sitting on a
black bear rug. Tari and Nagakura are sitting on the ground. Sister Deanara 
Tyrurdrenn is here, a blank look in her eyes. Brother Aaslef is here. Childe of
the Sands, Soraya Covante is here, hidden. She wields a lunar shield in her 
left hand and an Axe of Asakan Fury in her right. Brother Altec Xathclyde is

that WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading northeast (open door), east (closed door), south (open

A murmur rises from those gathered in the tavern, as suspicious and angry 
glances are shot your way.

The Drunken Ibex Tavern. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A large barrel of beer stands here. A
whimsical hammock of midnight blue with dangling moon and star beads rests
here, swaying gently. A simple chessboard made of wood rests here on a small
table. Pelt stretched out and mouth agape, a black bear rug has been thrown
here. Strangely slender, a chair resides near to the wall, crafted of pale wood
and overstuffed padding. Firmly, a carved ironwood chair rests here, bearing
the form of a lion. A smoky glass phial has been left here. Several green
leaves still clinging to its stubby stem, a small green apple rests on the
ground here. Wrapped in a tight bundle, a sheaf of grain lies here. A narrow
orange capped mushroom has been left here. Marnor the barkeep stands behind the
bar, polishing a mug. His curved horns displayed proudly, this tame ibex
nibbles at a weed growing nearby. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a
massive shire stands here poised and alert. A mighty redwood eagle soars
through the air here, silent as a whisper as its eyes focus upon the ground. A
white wolf stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey. Ike is sitting on a
black bear rug. Tari and Nagakura are sitting on the ground. Brother Aaslef is
here. Childe of the Sands, Soraya Covante is here, hidden. She wields a lunar
shield in her left hand and an Axe of Asakan Fury in her right. Brother Altec
Xathclyde is here. Sister Deanara Tyrurdrenn is here. Sister Enyalida is here,
pondering. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see
what is for sale.
You see exits leading northeast (open door), east (closed door), south (open
door), and in.
A murmur rises from those gathered in the tavern, as suspicious and angry
