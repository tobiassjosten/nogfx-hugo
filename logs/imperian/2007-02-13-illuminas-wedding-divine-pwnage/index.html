Lord acknowledges the superior tongue."

Kayden chitters happily.

Aralin nods her head.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I understand that you two wish
to be wed. I am glad that My hands will be held clasped, knowing that it will

(Ring): Kayden says, "*prodprod* What was the lol for? =P."

(Ring): You say, "Oh, it was a little different when I looked at him. It&#39;s not 
as funny now."

(Ring): Kayden says, "What&#39;d it say?"

(Ring): You say, "He is a radiant Immortal and is like, made of Light, man."

(Ring): Kayden says, "...rofl."

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I believe you each wish to say
something."

Kayden nods his head.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Aralin, in Akrabi, "You have 
been given an honor, Aralin, as have I. We have been given each other - and 
there is no gift greater than the Hands of God Himself to find their way to one
another."

Aralin&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind her.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Aralin, in Akrabi, "I bring you 
before the beginnings of greatness, to the sight of Srifat Midbere - the very 
origin of mortal Purity. Before him, I take you as my wife, I make you strong 
and whole, I make you Midbere."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist clicks.

The spirit of Srifat Midbere nods proudly.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to the spirit of Srifat Midbere, in
Akrabi, "And to you, Father, I present this woman. I give you my own word that 
she will uphold this name we guard so proudly. She is Pure, and worth our 
heritage. In time, she will prove herself to you, as she has proven to me."

Aralin&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind her.

The spirit of Srifat Midbere says, "I trust that for her to gain your approval,
there would be no reason for me to doubt her."

Kayden&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind him.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Lord, I 
only pray that we may continue to serve You. That the honor of walking in Your 
Light is not taken from us, and that we are eternally permitted to serve as 
your Hands, aye? As your blade to cut through the swath of heretics within this
world - and as your shield, to rise up and stand against the tide of demons. By
Your will, we will see that they crash against us, only to be tossed aside and 
cut down without hesitation."

It is the 16th day of Aequitas, in the year 513 AD.

Kayden gives Aralin an acknowledging nod.

Aralin Amherst, Marble Fist says to Kayden, in Akrabi, "Countless times have 
you proven yourself to be Pure, as well as unrelenting in strengthening your 
Self. Your strength of both mind and body is admirable indeed, and I am honored
in this union. I believe you compliment my attributes, Kayden, and that I am 
strengthened when we are together. His Hands shall never falter when joined. 
For this, I am both honored and pleased to give my hand in marriage, and take 
the name of Midbere. I am confident in my ability to uphold the strength of 
your name, and I give you my word that I shall not let down the legacy of the 
Midbere."

Kayden&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind him.

Aralin Amherst, Marble Fist says, in Akrabi, "I cast off the name of Amherst, a
bloodline mottled with filth. I willingly give this up to ascend to the 
superiority of the Midbere. I reject my current bloodline in order to become 
Pure, as well as worthy."

Kayden&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Aralin Amherst, Marble Fist says to the spirit of Srifat Midbere, in Akrabi, "I
am honoured to become apart of the legacy which you created. I pledge my 
loyalty in all things, and shall place the family above all."

Aralin Amherst, Marble Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "To you, Lord, I 
pledge my service, as always. Your will shall be carried out, and Your words 
shall be known. It is an honour to walk in Your Light, and to serve You."

Aralin nods her head.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I know that neither of you 
will shirk from your duties, and that through this union you understand that 
Purity is the highest goal in life. With these words, I pronounce the two of 
you to be wed, basked in My Light."

The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.

Welam nods his head.

The spirit of Srifat Midbere smiles.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Aralin, in Akrabi, "A much more 
fitting name."

Kayden gives Aralin a peck on the cheek.

Aralin wraps her tail affectionately around Kayden, pulling him close.

Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says, in Akrabi, "Indeed."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to the spirit of Srifat Midbere, in
Akrabi, "Father, it has been an honor to be in your presence."

marriage."

Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Our thanks, Lord."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Indeed."
The spirit of Srifat Midbere says, "I do wish I could remain, but my ties to 
the mortal realm are weak, and I must return to the spirit world."

Kayden gives the spirit of Srifat Midbere an acknowledging nod.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Master 
Welam has done well, aye? His actions as an Ascetic continue to prove himself a
worthy Illuminai."

Aralin&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind her.

Welam nods his head politely.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says to Welam, in Akrabi, "Your defence of the 
Taekyon, preventing the impure from joining their ranks, has proven your mettle
and inner Light to be Pure."

Kayden&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind him.

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans tightens his belt at his 
waist, inclining his head in respect.

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, 
"Congratulations on your marriage, Grand Master, His Marble Hand."

Aralin&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind her.

Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "Our thanks, Master 
Welam."

Welam nods his head politely.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "Welam, Qiulelifire I trust 
that both of you will follow the examples of My Hands, and spread the Light 
through this ever-darkening world."

You bow respectfully to Illuminas.

You say, in Akrabi, "I will, without a doubt."

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says to Welam, in Akrabi, "This holds especially
true for the desert, where the sands seem to swirl with growing intensity each 
day, blocking out the suns, and the Light they provide."

Kayden gives Illuminas an acknowledging nod.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "Perhaps the 
torch, so to speak, should be passed to you, Master."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "I charge you 
with directing the Desert City to the path towards salvation."

The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "I am 
afraid, though that this is a task that at this time I am not ready to 
complete."

Welam kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "It will take 
time, Master. We are aware of this."

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "It is at 
this juncture that I must confide that I have found myself unworthy of the 
title Illuminai, and wish to concede my title as one among you."

Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "With effort and 
conviction, I believe it can be done."

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "I have 
found within myself inner conflict, and it is written that I cannot have this. 
I have found within myself an imperfection and I do Lord Illuminas, and the 
rest of you, a disservice by continuing to count myself among Your Order."

Aralin taps her tail against the ground.

You purse your lips contemplatively.

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "I remove 
my anklet with a heavy heart."

Welam removes an anklet of white marble and gleaming onyx.

Welam gives an anklet of white marble and gleaming onyx to Illuminas, the 
Bringer of Hope.

Kayden narrows his eyes to thin slits.

(Ring): Aralin says, "BURN THE UNWORTHY."

(Ring): You say, "Rofl."

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope takes the anklet in hand and crushes it slowly, 
never dropping His stare from Welam.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist takes a step to the side, removing 
himself from between Illuminas and Welam.

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "I infect 
this place with my impurity. I ask that I be discharged in the way that is 
fit."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "I cannot 
protect you from what you have done, Master. An unfortunate and ill thought 
decision on your path."

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "You dare to come and stand 
before Me, before those who are Pure, witness a ceremony of utmost holiness, 
then throw off My charge with a toss of the hand."

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "No toss, 
my Lord. This comes after months of conflict. I asked my Grand Master to 
abstain from this."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "This much
is true, Lord. I did not foresee such an announcement, however."

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "The impurity you show ranks 
among that of those who wield magick, and know it blinds them, yet decide to 
use it&#39;s weakening force regardless."

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "Rather than seek My guidance 
towards Purity, you have turned away from My path and retreat to an easier 
way."

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans inclines his head, silent 
with a face of stone.

Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "A poor decision indeed, 
Welam."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "I am 
disappointed. Such potential. Such strength."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "All to 
waste."

Kayden whips his tail around, segments clicking loudly, and slaps Welam in the 
face with it.

Aralin taps her tail against the ground.

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans winces, yet remains silent 
as he stares at the floor.

You purse your lips contemplatively.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "He knows 
what he has done, Lord. I leave this to Your wisdom."

A dark, swirling vortex opens to the south and drags Welam through it before 
closing.
Kayden raises an eyebrow questioningly.

You blink.

Welam has been hacked to death by Knight Commander Khizan Vladin, Ranger of the
Wildwood.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "This does not allow him to 
avoid Judgment. He shall return and face Me when he returns from Dis."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "As You 
command."

You nod slowly.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist asks Illuminas, in Akrabi, "And the 
demon?"

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I leave him to you all, to be 
hunted and slain."

Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Your will shall be 
carried out, Lord."


You sense the following souls in Imperian:

(Ring): You say, "Did Welam leave? :/."

(Ring): Aralin says, "He&#39;s still dead."

(Ring): Aralin says, "Wait, alive again."

(Ring): Aralin says, "Now he DIES AGAIN."

(Ring): You say, "Lol."

(Ring): Aralin says, "Only not to Khizan!"

(Ring): You say, "That was so anti-climatic."

(Ring): Aralin says, ":(."


(Ring): You say, "I expected divine smiteage and then Khizan just vortexes him 
and kills him :(."

(Ring): Kayden says, ":(."

Welam arrives from the ether.

As Welam speaks the majestic words, blinding light fills the room and he is 
greeted by Duister, holding the door open for him.

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans sinks to his knee again, 
not letting the image of the Lord Illuminas enter into his vision.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "That you 
return to face your Judgement is admirable."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "It cannot, 
however, lessen the blow."

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, "I accept it. I have 
failed."

Kayden nods his head.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "You have said yourself that 
you are not fit to be here, within My temple, or My order."

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "And if you choose not to look 
at me while you cast off My charge, I will make it abundantly clear."

Illuminas, Lord of Light raises his fist slowly, holds it briefly, and brings 
it down swiftly in a crushing blow. His fist shimmers with a radiant Light as 
he hurls a spear of immense force through Welam.

Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans chokes, breathing blood and
fire.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "You have chosen the path of 
weakness, and it heads straight through Dis."

Overcome by death, Welam&#39;s spirit fades to grey.

Kayden picks up the corpse of Welam.

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist clicks in a series of slow, 
contemplative tones.

Aralin taps her tail against the ground.

Illuminas gives a pained sigh.

You furrow your brow in troubled thought.

Ring): Aralin says, "SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU QUIT THE ORDER?"

(Ring): You say, "D:."

(Ring): You say, ":ph34r:."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "His body 
will be offered to Your might."

Aralin leaves to the north following Kayden.

Aralin enters from the north following Kayden.

Aralin nods her head.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "It is unfortunate that he 
chose weakness. But choice is essential for Purity to have importance."

Aralin nods her head.

Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says, in Akrabi, "I trust that the rest of Your 
Order shall chose appropriately, Lord, and cast off any weaknesses."

Illuminas nods His head.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to you, in Akrabi, "With this out 
of the way, I believe you are in need of an anklet yet, aye?"

You nod slowly.
Illuminas gives an anklet of white marble and gleaming onyx to you.

You bow respectfully to Illuminas.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I trust that you will never 
return it to me."

Kayden smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

You say, in Akrabi, "I will wear it with pride. It will never be removed."

The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.

Aralin&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind her.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I hope you all reflect on 
this, as I will. I trust that none others will fall as he did, knowing what the
choices are. If you require anything of Me, now is the time to mention it."

Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "You have our utmost 
loyalty, Lord."

You nod your head.

Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "Farewell then, and stay true 
to your ideals."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Quite."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Of 
course, my Lord."

Kayden faces Illuminas, presses his palms together before him and performs a 
respectful bow.

You bow respectfully to Illuminas.

Aralin faces Illuminas, presses her palms together before her and performs a 
respectful bow.

(Ring): Aralin says, "Well. That was awesome."

(Ring): You say, "Best. Wedding. Ever."

(Ring): Kayden says, "Ya rly."

(Ring): Kayden says, "Fuck a reception. We had a charred ex Order member!"

(Ring): Aralin says, "Go us!"

(Ring): You say, "Rofl."'>As you speak the majestic words, blinding light fills the room and you are
greeted by Duister, holding the door open for you.
A domed room of blazing light.
This has been marked as holy ground. Duister stands here serenely, his
unusually colored eyes measuring all who pass. The shining figure of a Seraphic
guardian floats in the air here. Aralin Amherst, Marble Fist is here. She is
holding a tower shield in her left hand. Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist

been given an honor, Aralin, as have I. We have been given each other - and

another."

Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Aralin, in Akrabi, "I bring you
before the beginnings of greatness, to the sight of Srifat Midbere - the very

only pray that we may continue to serve You. That the honor of walking in Your
Light is not taken from us, and that we are eternally permitted to serve as
your Hands, aye? As your blade to cut through the swath of heretics within this
world - and as your shield, to rise up and stand against the tide of demons. By
Your will, we will see that they crash against us, only to be tossed aside and
cut down without hesitation."
It is the 16th day of Aequitas, in the year 513 AD.
Kayden gives Aralin an acknowledging nod.
Aralin Amherst, Marble Fist says to Kayden, in Akrabi, "Countless times have
you proven yourself to be Pure, as well as unrelenting in strengthening your
Self. Your strength of both mind and body is admirable indeed, and I am honored
in this union. I believe you compliment my attributes, Kayden, and that I am
strengthened when we are together. His Hands shall never falter when joined.
For this, I am both honored and pleased to give my hand in marriage, and take
the name of Midbere. I am confident in my ability to uphold the strength of
your name, and I give you my word that I shall not let down the legacy of the
Midbere."
Kayden's deadly tail sways slowly behind him.
Aralin Amherst, Marble Fist says, in Akrabi, "I cast off the name of Amherst, a
bloodline mottled with filth. I willingly give this up to ascend to the
superiority of the Midbere. I reject my current bloodline in order to become
Pure, as well as worthy."

Taekyon, preventing the impure from joining their ranks, has proven your mettle
and inner Light to be Pure."

that both of you will follow the examples of My Hands, and spread the Light
through this ever-darkening world."
You bow respectfully to Illuminas.
You say, in Akrabi, "I will, without a doubt."
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says to Welam, in Akrabi, "This holds especially
true for the desert, where the sands seem to swirl with growing intensity each
day, blocking out the suns, and the Light they provide."
Kayden gives Illuminas an acknowledging nod.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "Perhaps the
torch, so to speak, should be passed to you, Master."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "I charge you
with directing the Desert City to the path towards salvation."
The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "I am
afraid, though that this is a task that at this time I am not ready to
complete."
Welam kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "It will take
time, Master. We are aware of this."
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "It is at
this juncture that I must confide that I have found myself unworthy of the
title Illuminai, and wish to concede my title as one among you."
Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "With effort and
conviction, I believe it can be done."
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "I have
found within myself inner conflict, and it is written that I cannot have this.
I have found within myself an imperfection and I do Lord Illuminas, and the
rest of you, a disservice by continuing to count myself among Your Order."
Aralin taps her tail against the ground.
You purse your lips contemplatively.
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "I remove
my anklet with a heavy heart."
Welam removes an anklet of white marble and gleaming onyx.
Welam gives an anklet of white marble and gleaming onyx to Illuminas, the
Bringer of Hope.
Kayden narrows his eyes to thin slits.
(Ring): Aralin says, "BURN THE UNWORTHY."
(Ring): You say, "Rofl."
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope takes the anklet in hand and crushes it slowly,
never dropping His stare from Welam.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist takes a step to the side, removing
himself from between Illuminas and Welam.
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "I infect
this place with my impurity. I ask that I be discharged in the way that is
fit."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "I cannot
protect you from what you have done, Master. An unfortunate and ill thought
decision on your path."
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "You dare to come and stand
before Me, before those who are Pure, witness a ceremony of utmost holiness,
then throw off My charge with a toss of the hand."
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, in Akrabi, "No toss,
my Lord. This comes after months of conflict. I asked my Grand Master to
abstain from this."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "This much
is true, Lord. I did not foresee such an announcement, however."
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "The impurity you show ranks
among that of those who wield magick, and know it blinds them, yet decide to
use it's weakening force regardless."
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "Rather than seek My guidance
towards Purity, you have turned away from My path and retreat to an easier
way."
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans inclines his head, silent
with a face of stone.
Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "A poor decision indeed,
Welam."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "I am
disappointed. Such potential. Such strength."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "All to
waste."
Kayden whips his tail around, segments clicking loudly, and slaps Welam in the
face with it.
Aralin taps her tail against the ground.
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans winces, yet remains silent
as he stares at the floor.
You purse your lips contemplatively.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "He knows
what he has done, Lord. I leave this to Your wisdom."
A dark, swirling vortex opens to the south and drags Welam through it before
closing.
Kayden raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You blink.
Welam has been hacked to death by Knight Commander Khizan Vladin, Ranger of the
Wildwood.
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "This does not allow him to
avoid Judgment. He shall return and face Me when he returns from Dis."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "As You
command."
You nod slowly.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist asks Illuminas, in Akrabi, "And the
demon?"
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I leave him to you all, to be
hunted and slain."
Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Your will shall be
carried out, Lord."
You sense the following souls in Imperian:
(Ring): You say, "Did Welam leave? :/."
(Ring): Aralin says, "He's still dead."
(Ring): Aralin says, "Wait, alive again."
(Ring): Aralin says, "Now he DIES AGAIN."
(Ring): You say, "Lol."
(Ring): Aralin says, "Only not to Khizan!"
(Ring): You say, "That was so anti-climatic."
(Ring): Aralin says, ":(."
(Ring): You say, "I expected divine smiteage and then Khizan just vortexes him
and kills him :(."
(Ring): Kayden says, ":(."
Welam arrives from the ether.
As Welam speaks the majestic words, blinding light fills the room and he is
greeted by Duister, holding the door open for him.
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans sinks to his knee again,
not letting the image of the Lord Illuminas enter into his vision.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "That you
return to face your Judgement is admirable."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Welam, in Akrabi, "It cannot,
however, lessen the blow."
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans says, "I accept it. I have
failed."
Kayden nods his head.
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "You have said yourself that
you are not fit to be here, within My temple, or My order."
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "And if you choose not to look
at me while you cast off My charge, I will make it abundantly clear."
Illuminas, Lord of Light raises his fist slowly, holds it briefly, and brings
it down swiftly in a crushing blow. His fist shimmers with a radiant Light as
he hurls a spear of immense force through Welam.
Master Welam Agarwaen, Stoic of the Southern Parans chokes, breathing blood and
fire.
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "You have chosen the path of
weakness, and it heads straight through Dis."
Overcome by death, Welam's spirit fades to grey.
Kayden picks up the corpse of Welam.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist clicks in a series of slow,
contemplative tones.
Aralin taps her tail against the ground.
Illuminas gives a pained sigh.
You furrow your brow in troubled thought.
Ring): Aralin says, "SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU QUIT THE ORDER?"
(Ring): You say, "D:."
(Ring): You say, ":ph34r:."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "His body
will be offered to Your might."
Aralin leaves to the north following Kayden.
Aralin enters from the north following Kayden.
Aralin nods her head.
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "It is unfortunate that he
chose weakness. But choice is essential for Purity to have importance."
Aralin nods her head.
Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says, in Akrabi, "I trust that the rest of Your
Order shall chose appropriately, Lord, and cast off any weaknesses."
Illuminas nods His head.
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to you, in Akrabi, "With this out
of the way, I believe you are in need of an anklet yet, aye?"
You nod slowly.
Illuminas gives an anklet of white marble and gleaming onyx to you.
You bow respectfully to Illuminas.
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I trust that you will never
return it to me."
Kayden smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
You say, in Akrabi, "I will wear it with pride. It will never be removed."
The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.
Aralin's deadly tail sways slowly behind her.
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "I hope you all reflect on
this, as I will. I trust that none others will fall as he did, knowing what the
choices are. If you require anything of Me, now is the time to mention it."
Aralin Midbere, Marble Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "You have our utmost
loyalty, Lord."
You nod your head.
Illuminas, the Bringer of Hope says, in Akrabi, "Farewell then, and stay true
to your ideals."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Quite."
Grand Master Kayden Midbere, Onyx Fist says to Illuminas, in Akrabi, "Of
course, my Lord."
Kayden faces Illuminas, presses his palms together before him and performs a
respectful bow.
You bow respectfully to Illuminas.
Aralin faces Illuminas, presses her palms together before her and performs a
respectful bow.
(Ring): Aralin says, "Well. That was awesome."
