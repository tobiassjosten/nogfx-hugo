I've dealt with Siath and his player before.  He was fond of attacking 
'magickers' to run them out of bashing areas he wanted, but were otherwise 
occupied. It seems as if he's bored of bashing and freeforalls and is back to fabricating reasons to attack me. Earlier this evening I was jumped by a team of Stavennite characters and fled into the Heartland/Greytrem area and was set upon by Song and Aidan. The latter, is a person I have never met. Soon after the fight degenerated into a delightful team skirmish between 
Kira/Andun/Hebi/Song/Aidan vs myself/Nanten/Insinyan and later Jaskis/Zarok. A name you'll notice missing here is Siath. This could be because he was afk, in the arena or too scared that he would die in a team fight. An hour or so after the conflict, Siath attacks me without warning. His reason was 'you fought in a team fight with Kinsarmar against Antioch.&#34; Siath had ample time to attack during the team-skirmish, ample time to counter-attack with the group five minutes after and sixty minutes after when they were roving through the Aori Bay. The fact he is acting alone and not in tandem with his 'allies' only goes to show that his motivation is not the team battle and more his boredom and desire to pick on someone else. Were his player to want to play with everyone else? He should start joining the 'real' conflicts and stop fabricating his own to attack people over level 90.

I had to reply&mldr; to this.. stupidity</p><p>Greetings Garden. I don&rsquo;t know where to begin&mldr; Perhaps I should begin and say that Issues are OOC. In which case this issue is already confusing. However, to reply to the issue about an single jpk in caanae&mldr; First off all, Ahkan&rsquo;s player shouldn&rsquo;t speak about anything that he has no knowledge about. This issue seems more to me be a complain about Siath bashing or doing FFA&rsquo;s. Now.. Siath is Anti-magick, which makes it quite naturual for him to defend it and RP around it. The character Ahkan have also lately been very swift to enemy everyone from Ithaqua (Which Siath is a part of) to Khandava without any reason more then &ldquo;A group came and attacked us&rdquo;. Now, once again&mldr; this issue is the typical &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to deal with it IC&rdquo; issue. I said it so many times before, ISSUES are not about single kills or attacks. Does Siath have a reason to kill Nanten, Ahkan, Insinyan, Jaskis? Of course! He is the Grand Master of Manoa, which also means that he is strictly bound to Antioch and her members. Ahkan&rsquo;s player apparently thinks that just because an hour passed you no longer have the right to attack him? And not to mention, as soon as Siath saw his guildmember and members of Antioch die, he went to mindlock Nanten, which Ahkan also noticed, otherwise I am confused to why they tried to prism to Siath. It&rsquo;s hard to make an very good response to an issue that contains complains over all different kinds of things, that has NOTHING to do with issues to begin with. And I would like Ahkan&rsquo;s player to show me WHEN I attacked &lsquo;magickers&rsquo; to take &ldquo;their&rdquo; bashing areas. And seriously.. What does this even have to do with anything?
