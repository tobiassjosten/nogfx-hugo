(southeast) 
Path around the walls. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The path circling the walls is cracked and uneven, roots of plantlife having 
grown under the stone itself. Clumps of grass poke up from within the cracks, 
and small white daisies are dotted here and there, and between the gaps in the 
path, you can spot the hard wood of tree roots wreathing in the earth beneath. 
The wall to the east of the path is crumbling slowly, and looks unsafe to touch
as if it might fall at any moment. A sigil in the shape of a knife lies here.
You see exits leading south and northwest.

Next to an ivy-covered wall. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
Thick, vibrant ivy has over-grown the whole of the arena wall here, slowly 
adding to the crumbling of the stone as its roots work their way across. Almost
as if a green curtain had been thrown over wall itself, the ivy is a testament 
to the ages that have past since this place was constructed. Tendrils wreath 
the floor with thick vines, threatening to entangle your feet, and there 
appears to be a nest of some sort within the flora, left over from nesting 
years past. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground 
here.
You see exits leading north and south.

You feel an aura of rebounding surround you. (anti-weapon field)
Near a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The ruined archway of this once-great arena lies just to the west, while the 
road continues in its circuitous route around the decaying walls. A thick 
marble pillar lies across the road here, broken into jagged pieces of varying 
size. The pillar came from inside the arena, ruining the wall with its 
tumultuous downfall, and lies across the entire road, here. A swirling vortex 
floats here. Edmund Karukett is here. He is holding a tower shield in his left 
hand.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and west.

H:403/403(0) M:327/354(0) E:1918 W:1080 XP:85 <eb bd><valena> <20:11:41:531> 

South of a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
To the north, the great arches that once represented the triumphant gates of a 
mighty arena lie in near ruins. The road that winds around the walls of the 
arena is in fairly decent state here, as most of it is whole. A few cracks in 
the road are visible more because of the various grasses and flowers that grow 
out of them than the black lines that would usually accompany such cracks.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and southwest.

Crumbled path leading down. (Southwestern Arena.)
The small quake that buried the southwestern part of the arena has clearly made
its mark upon the path that leads around the arena walls. The path is twisted 
and rises into small hills, and the western end of the path leads far down into
the underground. Grass and flowers grow up out of broken parts of the path as 
nature attempts to recover the area.
You see exits leading northeast and down.

Collapsed arena path. (Southwestern Arena.)
The path leading down to the underground here collapsed with a little less 
rampant destruction than in the other exits of the underground. It gradually 
leads up from here, broken at pitted at times but in relatively good condition 
considering the abrupt collapse of the path in other areas. Small tunnels 
branch off from this room into the rest of the underground.
You see exits leading north, west, and up.

Debris-choked underground path. (Southwestern Arena.)
A small path connects two chambers of this underground system, very tight and 
narrow but with a fairly high ceiling. Rubble from the collapse of the arena 
grounds is strewn throughout the entire path, nearly blocking the narrow path 
at twists and turns. High above, the ceiling consists of packed dirt, the tree 
roots that poke through at regular intervals clearly form the base upon which 
the dirt is settled. A sigil in the shape of a knife lies here. Its head tilted
arrogantly, a salt and pepper gyrfalcon scans the area with a diligent gaze. 
Chirping with enthusiasm, a stunning songbird sways to and fro delightfully in 
the air. Verick Iscariot is here.
You see exits leading east and northwest.

South of a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
To the north, the great arches that once represented the triumphant gates of a 
mighty arena lie in near ruins. The road that winds around the walls of the 
arena is in fairly decent state here, as most of it is whole. A few cracks in 
the road are visible more because of the various grasses and flowers that grow 
out of them than the black lines that would usually accompany such cracks.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and southwest.

Near a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The ruined archway of this once-great arena lies just to the west, while the 
road continues in its circuitous route around the decaying walls. A thick 
marble pillar lies across the road here, broken into jagged pieces of varying 
size. The pillar came from inside the arena, ruining the wall with its 
tumultuous downfall, and lies across the entire road, here. A swirling vortex 
floats here. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground 
here. Apostle Xyleest Landstrider is here, grinning mischievously. Edmund 
Karukett is here, grinning mischievously. He is holding a tower shield in his 
left hand.

(west) 
A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena&#39;s walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance 
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking 
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of 
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena 
walls to the southwest.
You see exits leading east, south, southwest, and northwest.

Inside the crumbled walls. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena floor here is littered with debris that has accumulated over many 
years of disuse and decay. Ivy creeps over the arena wall, while weeds and 
grass have managed to pierce through the hard rock of the floor. The overgrowth
grows thicker as the path continues to the northwest. A sigil in the shape of a
knife lies here.
You see exits leading northeast and northwest.

Overgrown pathway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
A set of stairs leading downwards from a worn off trapdoor here is nearly 
hidden by the tremendous overgrowth that has reoccupied the mortal construction
of this arena. For to the north, you can see the two pillars jutting out of the
ground, the true last standing portions of what must have been an impressive 
sight to behold. A sigil in the shape of a knife lies here.
You see a single exit leading southeast.

Tunnel underneath the arena. (road). (Southwestern Arena.)
A few decaying pieces of metal and other parts of furniture indicate that this 
was once a staging room for the battles that once occurred on the main grounds 
of the arena. Time has taken its toll on this room, just like the rest of the 
ruins, as everything is in advanced states of decrepitude. A doorway to the 
north is partially blocked by a rotting door, held together only by the steel 
bands that used to strengthen it.
You see exits leading north and up.

Tunnel underneath the arena. (road). (Southwestern Arena.)
Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious 
glint to its eyes. A black, murky mist has settled here. Dripping with blood, 
an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the 
form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness.
You see exits leading north and up.

Tunnel underneath the arena. (road). (Southwestern Arena.)
A few decaying pieces of metal and other parts of furniture indicate that this 
was once a staging room for the battles that once occurred on the main grounds 
of the arena. Time has taken its toll on this room, just like the rest of the 
ruins, as everything is in advanced states of decrepitude. A doorway to the 
north is partially blocked by a rotting door, held together only by the steel 
bands that used to strengthen it. A black, murky mist has settled here. 
Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend 
and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the 
darkness.
You see exits leading north and up.

Overgrown pathway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
A set of stairs leading downwards from a worn off trapdoor here is nearly 
hidden by the tremendous overgrowth that has reoccupied the mortal construction
of this arena. For to the north, you can see the two pillars jutting out of the
ground, the true last standing portions of what must have been an impressive 
sight to behold. A sigil in the shape of a knife lies here. A black, murky mist
has settled here. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems 
to have a vicious glint to its eyes.
You see a single exit leading southeast.

Tunnel underneath the arena. (road). (Southwestern Arena.)
A few decaying pieces of metal and other parts of furniture indicate that this 
was once a staging room for the battles that once occurred on the main grounds 
of the arena. Time has taken its toll on this room, just like the rest of the 
ruins, as everything is in advanced states of decrepitude. A doorway to the 
north is partially blocked by a rotting door, held together only by the steel 
bands that used to strengthen it. A black, murky mist has settled here. Hands 
of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Apostle Xyleest

the ledge and down a steep portion of the cliff to end just before the decaying
walls of the arena. A dead black rat lies here, the fire in its eyes gone out. 
The body of a young rat lies here. There are 7 beehives here. An ice-encrusted 
monitor lizard paces here, its massive frame thrashing snow as it moves. A 
grizzled old rat lies here, dead as can be. Resting on the ground is a 
fist-shaped sigil. Apostle Xyleest Landstrider is here. She wields a sturdy 
shortsword in her left hand.

Path around the walls. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The path circling the walls is cracked and uneven, roots of plantlife having
grown under the stone itself. Clumps of grass poke up from within the cracks,
and small white daisies are dotted here and there, and between the gaps in the
path, you can spot the hard wood of tree roots wreathing in the earth beneath.
The wall to the east of the path is crumbling slowly, and looks unsafe to touch
as if it might fall at any moment. A sigil in the shape of a knife lies here.
You see exits leading south and northwest.

Next to an ivy-covered wall. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
Thick, vibrant ivy has over-grown the whole of the arena wall here, slowly
adding to the crumbling of the stone as its roots work their way across. Almost
as if a green curtain had been thrown over wall itself, the ivy is a testament
to the ages that have past since this place was constructed. Tendrils wreath
the floor with thick vines, threatening to entangle your feet, and there
appears to be a nest of some sort within the flora, left over from nesting
years past. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground
here.
You see exits leading north and south.

Near a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The ruined archway of this once-great arena lies just to the west, while the
road continues in its circuitous route around the decaying walls. A thick
marble pillar lies across the road here, broken into jagged pieces of varying
size. The pillar came from inside the arena, ruining the wall with its
tumultuous downfall, and lies across the entire road, here. A swirling vortex
floats here. Edmund Karukett is here. He is holding a tower shield in his left

South of a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
To the north, the great arches that once represented the triumphant gates of a
mighty arena lie in near ruins. The road that winds around the walls of the
arena is in fairly decent state here, as most of it is whole. A few cracks in
the road are visible more because of the various grasses and flowers that grow
out of them than the black lines that would usually accompany such cracks.

Crumbled path leading down. (Southwestern Arena.)
The small quake that buried the southwestern part of the arena has clearly made
its mark upon the path that leads around the arena walls. The path is twisted
and rises into small hills, and the western end of the path leads far down into
the underground. Grass and flowers grow up out of broken parts of the path as
nature attempts to recover the area.

Debris-choked underground path. (Southwestern Arena.)
A small path connects two chambers of this underground system, very tight and
narrow but with a fairly high ceiling. Rubble from the collapse of the arena
grounds is strewn throughout the entire path, nearly blocking the narrow path
at twists and turns. High above, the ceiling consists of packed dirt, the tree
roots that poke through at regular intervals clearly form the base upon which
the dirt is settled. A sigil in the shape of a knife lies here. Its head tilted

With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, Edmund's head lolls aimlessly

you realise that the throw did indeed snap the spine like a dry twig.
Edmund has been slain by Xyleest.

A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena
walls to the southwest.
You see exits leading east, south, southwest, and northwest.

Inside the crumbled walls. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena floor here is littered with debris that has accumulated over many
years of disuse and decay. Ivy creeps over the arena wall, while weeds and
grass have managed to pierce through the hard rock of the floor. The overgrowth
grows thicker as the path continues to the northwest. A sigil in the shape of a
knife lies here.
You see exits leading northeast and northwest.

Overgrown pathway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
A set of stairs leading downwards from a worn off trapdoor here is nearly
hidden by the tremendous overgrowth that has reoccupied the mortal construction
of this arena. For to the north, you can see the two pillars jutting out of the
ground, the true last standing portions of what must have been an impressive
sight to behold. A sigil in the shape of a knife lies here.
You see a single exit leading southeast.

Tunnel underneath the arena. (road). (Southwestern Arena.)
A few decaying pieces of metal and other parts of furniture indicate that this
was once a staging room for the battles that once occurred on the main grounds
of the arena. Time has taken its toll on this room, just like the rest of the
ruins, as everything is in advanced states of decrepitude. A doorway to the
north is partially blocked by a rotting door, held together only by the steel
bands that used to strengthen it.
You see exits leading north and up.

A few decaying pieces of metal and other parts of furniture indicate that this
was once a staging room for the battles that once occurred on the main grounds
of the arena. Time has taken its toll on this room, just like the rest of the
ruins, as everything is in advanced states of decrepitude. A doorway to the
north is partially blocked by a rotting door, held together only by the steel
bands that used to strengthen it. A black, murky mist has settled here.
Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend
and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the
darkness.
You see exits leading north and up.

follow, its blood-red hands shoot out and quickly burrow into the chest of Tahm
who begins screaming as his body bucks and convulses from the massive shock.

rips its powerful arms backwards, dragging an ephemeral, spiderweb substance
with it: Tahm's soul.

Overgrown pathway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
A set of stairs leading downwards from a worn off trapdoor here is nearly
hidden by the tremendous overgrowth that has reoccupied the mortal construction
of this arena. For to the north, you can see the two pillars jutting out of the
ground, the true last standing portions of what must have been an impressive
sight to behold. A sigil in the shape of a knife lies here. A black, murky mist
has settled here. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems
to have a vicious glint to its eyes.

Tunnel underneath the arena. (road). (Southwestern Arena.)
A few decaying pieces of metal and other parts of furniture indicate that this
was once a staging room for the battles that once occurred on the main grounds
of the arena. Time has taken its toll on this room, just like the rest of the
ruins, as everything is in advanced states of decrepitude. A doorway to the
north is partially blocked by a rotting door, held together only by the steel
bands that used to strengthen it. A black, murky mist has settled here. Hands
of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Apostle Xyleest
Landstrider is here. She wields a sturdy shortsword in her left hand.

Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
A ledge juts out from the sheer face of the cliff here, providing one with a
complete birds eye view of the inside of the arena. A small path leads off of
the ledge and down a steep portion of the cliff to end just before the decaying
walls of the arena. A dead black rat lies here, the fire in its eyes gone out.
The body of a young rat lies here. There are 7 beehives here. An ice-encrusted
monitor lizard paces here, its massive frame thrashing snow as it moves. A
grizzled old rat lies here, dead as can be. Resting on the ground is a
fist-shaped sigil. Apostle Xyleest Landstrider is here. She wields a sturdy
shortsword in her left hand.
You see a single exit leading down.
Your daegger comes racing towards you, stopping unnaturally quickly to land in
