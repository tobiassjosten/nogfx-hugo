Little hooks have been cleverly incorporated into the armor [0m[37mso that it can be removed, revealing the crimson silk dress underneath. The [0m[37mAscendari's feathered wings are mimicked by two thin wires stretched from the [0m[37mdoll's back to give structure from which long, ebony ribbons have been [0m[37mattached.
