Forest covered ruins. (Northwest Arena.)
The forest has grown here to reclaim a part of what was taken away by the 
mortals that constructed this colossal arena. All that is left of the stones

among the trees and grass. A small path still remains through the woodlands, 
leading further into the small forest to the southeast. A sigil in the shape of
a knife lies here. Hovering in the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic 
colours reflected in its wings.

The ruined arena wall stretches around the entire arena, and this road
encircles the wall. The road is in very poor shape, with huge gaps of it having
been taken over by grass and weeds. The wall is in equally poor shape, with
huge gaps having fallen down as time takes its toll. A particular gap to the
south gives one a glimpse of a forest that seems to have established itself
within the arena grounds themselves. Hovering in the air is a delicate
songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. A sigil in the shape of a

songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. Aspirant of the Red, Indica
Elochai, The Shadowed Pariah is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. She

Rubble-filled woodlands. (Northwest Arena.)
The forest is very thick here, trees blocking the view of the encircling walls
of the ruins. A few large pieces of rock, rubble left over from various pillars
that used to stand here, lie on the ground, most of them covered with various
forms of plant life as the forest slowly recovers. A sigil in the shape of a
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The shining figure of a Seraphic
guardian floats in the air here. Hovering in the air is a delicate songbird,
prismatic colours reflected in its wings.

A beatific look of bliss appears on Indica's face as her ears begin to harden

imprinting a short passage onto it.
You have slain Indica.

It&rsquo;s one of those classes that you can&rsquo;t kill but they can&rsquo;t kill you either. Maybe I&rsquo;m just really old and things have changed. But what I can say for sure is that Wytchen definitely required no skill to succeed in the class. I&rsquo;m certainly glad that Obliterate got its just desserts finally.
