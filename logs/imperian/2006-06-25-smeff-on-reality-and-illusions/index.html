This has been marked as holy ground. Laytrun, monk of Manoa, stands in the 
corner, head bowed in deep meditation. A bear of white marble stands here, a 
butterfly perched atop its outstretched paw. A display case is here. There are 
2 rolled-up bear skin prayer mats here. There are 2 akrabi prayer mats here. 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation is here.
You see exits leading east, west, and down.

Smeff nods his head politely.
 
You nod your head politely.
 
You beckon to Smeff.
 
Smeff begins to follow you.
 
Smeff follow you to the east.
A private nook in the dojang. (Monastery of Manoa.)
An ornate Antiochan rug of woven ibex hair covers the ground. A beautifully 
carved chess board is attached firmly to a heavy stand here.
You see exits leading northeast and west.
You take a seat on an ornate Antiochan rug.
 
You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."
 
You say, "Let&#39;s see... what would be a good topic to ask you about?"
 
You give Smeff the once-over, eyeing him suspiciously.
 
Smeff shrugs helplessly.
 
Smeff grins mischievously.
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "I have a bit of a 
background, just ask what you feel is needed."
 
You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.

You say, "I think I have found something which suits your personality and 
abilities just fine."
 
You give a mischievous grin.
 
Smeff chuckles long and heartily.

You say, "Tell me a bit about the perception of reality."
 
"Eh?" Smeff says curiously.
 
Smeff twitches spasmodically.
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "Perhaps I should do some 
reading?"
 
Smeff grins mischievously.
 
You say, "Oh, I think you are quite versed in explaining the difference between
what the eye sees and what may be just an illusion."
 
Comprehension flashes across Smeff&#39;s face.
 
Smeff grins mischievously.
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "So, in a philosophical 
sense, the difference between what One wants to see, and what One actually 
sees?"
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "What they want, and what 
they can get?"

You nod your head affirmatively.

You say, "Precisely."
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "Mortals can be very.. 
very.. easily manipulated to see your way."
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "I&#39;ve studied for decades 
on these techniques.."
  
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "You can make them feel 
loved, hated, accepted, to One&#39;s advantage. You can get them to join a certain 
Path in life, showing them the Light, but neglecting to the dark."
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "That&#39;s the jist of it, 
concealment is what an Illusion is.."
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "We cannot see fully what 
everyone wants or thinks."
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "Without that ability, we 
can be mislead by lies."
 
You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "We are all pawns in the 
Divine, in the end.."

You say, "So it is ignorance which causes the people to fall for illusions?"
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "All is seen by Them, and 
we are the Tools to guide others in the ways They wish."
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "In a way, yes."

You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.

You say, "If one would have reached perfection of body, mind and soul, whould 
he still fall for the illusions?"
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "To be Enlightened is to 
be as close to the Divine as One can get.. We may still fall victim, but 
unlikely, yes. We are still Mortal, no matter what we do."

You nod your head.

You say, "Well spoken."

You have appointed Smeff as The Diviners of the Way of the Path of the Spirit.
 
Smeff&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

You say, "Congratulations, Master."
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "Thank you."
 
Smeff&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
 
Smeff ponders the situation.

You bestow your guildfavour on Smeff.
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "Lecture.."
 
"Eh?" Smeff says curiously.

You raise an eyebrow questioningly.
 
Comprehension flashes across Smeff&#39;s face.
 
Smeff&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
 
Pressing his palms together before him, Smeff performs a respectful bow.

2006/05/13 14:41:34 - Rilore guildfavoured Smeff for: For having passed the 
initial challenges of the Path of the Spirit. Even though he is already a 
Valorous Dragon, hard work shall not go unnoticed.

You stand up from an ornate Antiochan rug.
 

Facing Smeff, you press your palms together before you and perform a respectful
bow.
 
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "I think I will prepare a 
grand lecture for some day...."

You give a mischievous grin.
Your pose is now: grinning mischievously.
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "If not for practical 
purposes, for the entertainment of argument and thought."

You say, "Grand Lectures are only required for the final task."
 
Smeff shrugs helplessly.
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "I will prepare it, now, 
then."
 
Smeff chuckles long and heartily.

You give a mischievous grin.
Your pose is now: grinning mischievously.
 
Master Smeff Valstivar, Sensei of Manipulation says, "Perhaps a smaller 
lecture."

You say, "The difference between the lectures simply lies in the number of 
required attendants."
 
Cool, stagnant air flows past, carried by an unseen force.

You shrug helplessly.
 
Smeff nods his head.
