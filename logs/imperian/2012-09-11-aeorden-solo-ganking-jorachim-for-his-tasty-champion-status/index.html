 kidney bursts with a horrifying liquid POP. Your spleen and appendix soon
 follow. Your screams of agony are cut off abruptly as your lungs splatter
 themselves against the inside of your ribcage. As the combination of blood and
 fatal poison reaches your brain, your skull becomes curiously tight... A mere
 second passes before your head explodes in a mess of gore and bone.

exuding a lambent glow. A muscular vorep prowls around here. Aeorden Zaridiux,
of the Suns is here, shrouded.
You see a single exit leading north.

Aeorden plunges his tail into your body, pumping you with Wyvern venom.
Blinding pain courses through your body as a sickening, bubbling venom attaches
itself to the poison flowing in your blood and begins to harden. As your
life-giving claret begins to crystallize and cut into your inner tissues, you
feel your organs grow dangerously heavy and full. Before long, your first
kidney bursts with a horrifying liquid POP. Your spleen and appendix soon
follow. Your screams of agony are cut off abruptly as your lungs splatter
themselves against the inside of your ribcage. As the combination of blood and
fatal poison reaches your brain, your skull becomes curiously tight... A mere
second passes before your head explodes in a mess of gore and bone.
You have been slain by Aeorden.
The corpse of a skeletal hound falls out of your inventory.
