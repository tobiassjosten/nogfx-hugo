A living daegger comes racing in towards Lyon, stopping unnaturally quickly to land in his grasp.

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1568 <eb db> 
The flaming marks upon the ground scorch the ground around them, licking out towards your feet as the ssylsin ritualist&#39;s voice rises in volume. The air grows heavy and thick, like walking in a dream, as a screaming wail pierces the air above the altar.

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1573 <eb db> 
The Pit is wrenched open against its will, swirling darkness and screams emanating from within as the writhing arms and appendages of demons and tortured souls reach out to the rent space before them. Energy from the ritual speeds into the darkness, its form taking on the shape of black and red chains that tighten as they appear to catch hold of something...

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1577 <eb db> 
From the darkest reaches of the pit, a being is brought forth, a grotesquely obese demon with massive lower quarters and a human-like upper body. It struggles against the chains until it sees the rent space between the pit and the mortal plane, then charges forth to emerge from the darkness into this world.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1578 <eb db> 
Lyon Zaridiux mutters, in Hanyou, "Look closely, and you sha.. see, .... has ..de a ...s of me.."

There are 51 players in this world.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1579 <eb db> 
Lyon makes a disimpassioned gesture at his Ouroboros as it spins and quickly dissolves into nothing.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1580 <eb db> 
Lyon looks thoughtfully at a grandiose and obese demon&#39;s profile, pondering the situation.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1580 <eb db> 
The opening to the pit begins to seal itself as reality fights to heal the tear in the veil.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 <eb db> 
Dicey draws in a deep smokey breath as her yellow eyes follow the large beast. Her fingers clench slightly tighter on her weaponry.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 <eb db> 
The sun climbs to its apex, scattering darkness, illuminating the land with its holy light.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 <eb db> 
Mozlok says, "Mozlok will handle this."
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 <eb db> 
The end of Dicey&#39;s churata glows brightly as she takes a long drag from it.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 <eb db> 
Lowering the churata, Dicey exhales creating a train of smoke rings that float lazily into the air.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 <eb db> 
Mozlok watches the obese demon as it raises its massive maul to strike out at those around them. At the last moment, he strikes out deceivingly fast with the stinger at the end of his crocodilian tail, striking the demon in its face.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1583 <eb db> 
You nod your acknowledgement of Mozlok.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1583 <eb db> 
The firmament grows darker as the clouds begin to smother the light.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1583 <eb db> 
Slowly, the demon&#39;s face begins to burn away, and it screams with rage as it once again lifts its maul to strike at its new target, the entity Mozlok. As chunks of his face fall away, Mozlok steps aside as the maul is buried into the ground beside him, narrowly missing the altar.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1584 <eb db> 
Sudden movement yields a glimpse of a swamp snake before it darts out of sight.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1585 <eb db> 
The ground shakes with the impact of the maul, and causes the rotted stump near the altar to split, sending shards of wood scattering about.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1585 <eb db> 
As the demon screams, lifting up his maul to swing again, Mozlok simply steps forward, bringing the bone and iron caber down atop its head, and into the ground far below. The demon&#39;s body sags as the weight of death falls upon it.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1586 <eb db> 
(Ring): Selthis says, "[Game] Amaris logged in."
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1587 <eb db> 
With little care, Mozlok removes his caber from the ground, shaking free bits of what was once the demons face, and tosses the dead body atop the altar, where the four arms of the altar begin tearing the usable pieces away from the scrap, which falls into the toothy maw below. Black blood and viscous gore coat the area in a mist, and the circle below the altar glows as the energy fights to keep the rift in the veil open.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1587 <eb db> 
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Ryac.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1590 <eb db> 
Ryac rubs some salve on his skin.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1590 <eb db> 
Lyon keeping his position near the circle, but shifting his body to place his small buckler between the demon and the entity as the bloody mist rises from their struggle.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1590 <eb db> 
Quietly, Lady Dicey Dios, Ephora says, "Good fight.."
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1591 <eb db> 
Your ally, High Judge Maglust Argyle, Death Incarnate, has entered Imperian.

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1592 <e- db>

You will now attempt to parry attacks to your right leg.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1592 <eb db> 
Mozlok says, "That was too easy. Mozlok is not amused by this."
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1592 <eb db> 
Euden&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Lyon Zaridiux says to Mozlok, in Hanyou, "Take that up with the Pit. It only spits out certain things."
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1594 <eb db> 
A cowled ssylsin ritualist rubs his hands together as he observes the ritual progress. He reads aloud from a scroll, words flowing together as he enters a haze, the power from the altar pulsing brightly once more, and chains of energy firing into the shrinking rift, forcing it open once more.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1594 <eb db> 
Lyon urges a cowled ssylsin ritualist onwards.

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1595 <eb db> 
The chains tighten as another creature is pulled forth, this one a morbid hybrid between a crocodile and a man that simply stands as the chains of energy pull him forth into this plane through the rift, a wicked blade held in each of his six arms. He glares balefully about the room before charging the chanting ssylsin ritualist.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1596 <eb db> 
Lyon&#39;s forked tongue flickers out as he examines a crocodilian amorphous demon inquisitively.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1598 <eb db> 
Dicey seeks to draw in a drag of her churata, only to find it extingued by the wet debris of the battle. She spits it from her mouth, sniffs, and flicks it aside, before blinkingly returning her attention to the goings on.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1598 <eb db> 
Mozlok says, "Mozlok hopes this is more of a challenge."

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1599 <eb db> 
Mozlok smashes the demon in the chest with his caber, sending it sprawling momentarily as it fights to regain its footing, rising moments later and charging again.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1600 <eb db> 
Dicey opens a sleek black satchel.

Lowering the churata, Dicey exhales creating a train of smoke rings that float lazily into the air.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1600 <eb db> 
Lyon whispers something to Dicey.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1602 <eb db> 
Swinging the caber like a sword, Mozlok smashes the crocodilian demon across the jaw, pieces of teeth flying out from its great face.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1602 <eb db> 
(Ring): Selthis says, "[Game] Lilesra logged in."

A great weight seems to have been lifted from Ryac.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1605 <eb db> 
Ryac rubs some salve on his skin.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1605 <eb db> 
You say to Lyon, "Nice reflexes."

(Ring): Selthis says, "[Game] Asiemma logged in."
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1607 <eb db> 
The crocodilian demon snarls, wiping blood from its mouth as it attempts to attack the entity with its many blades. Mozlok, without trying, brings his great face forward, impaling the demon with his tusks.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1607 <eb db> 
A slender rolled churata Lyon is holding flickers and then fades.
Dicey&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1607 <eb db> 
Lyon quickly lights up a slender rolled churata.

Lowering the churata, Lyon exhales creating a train of smoke rings that float lazily into the air.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1608 <eb db> 
As the body of the crocodilian demon is placed upon the altar, the metal limbs begin separating the useful body parts from the trash. As if controlled by some higher power, the machine begins to affix these body parts to the ones already gathered, hooking the pieces of flesh and bone together with great metal stitches.

Lyon smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1610 <eb db> 
You say to a cowled ssylsin ritualist, "This mighty pet is no match for our Mozlok it seems."

Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Our altar is a chirurgeon."

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1615 <eb db> 
A cowled ssylsin ritualist cackles gleefully as he watches the creature being slowly pieced together. He moves on to summon the final beast, reading from his scroll with an insane fervor.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1615 <eb db> 
Lyon examines the tooth as he puffs upon his churata, before depositing it into the folds of his surcoat.

Dicey quickly lights up a slender rolled churata.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1617 <eb db> 
The tendrils of energy lash out into the gaping rift once more, a keening echoing through the room as the veil pushes against the intrusion. The portal begins to collapse, but then the chains take hold of another beast, pulling it forth from the pit.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1617 <eb db> 
A sudden eruption of a distant volcano lightens up the firmament.

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1618 <eb db> 
As the third demon emerges, the keening wanes, and the energy holding the rift open begins to stabilize, the wailing and grasping limb from the rift reach out at the almost beastlike demon that steps forth, but all noise covered by the shrieking call it sounds as it charges those who are gathered before it.

Lashing out with its acid tipped stinger, the wyvern-like demon attempts to strike at Mozlok, but he swings his caber into the opposing limb, batting it away as he drives his weapon into its chest.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1619 <eb db> 
Lyon ponders the situation.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1621 <eb db> 
Mozlok brings a heavy caber crashing down atop the head of a wyvern-like demon, and the sound of cracking bone resonates loudly.

Taken from his trance, the ssylsin ritualist ducks to the side at the last minute, the wyvern&#39;s teeth barely skimming his back as he rushes towards northeastern exit into the swamp.

As the final demon is placed upon the altar, the hands begin their tireless work once more.

This monstrous creature radiates an aura of demonic energies in an almost visible shadow that surrounds it with writhing tentacles of darkness. Its body appears to be a combination of a few different creatures held together by large metal stitches that ooze with the demon&#39;s black blood. His body is comprised of one great beast that consists of the lower body similar to a great pachyderm, and the upper body of a tanari man, both covered in thick gray flesh. The back of the pachyderm body has a sheet of heavy scaled hide stitched to it like morbid once-living armor, and matching wings sprout from the creatures back, though whether or not they are enough to lift the beast is doubtful. A crocodilian tail sprouts from the rear of the beast, the dual spines running its length tipped in molten gold. Gems are embedded in decorative patterns that line the flanks of the beast, black blood oozing from around them as if they were recently pressed into the thick flesh. His head is that of a great wolf, hairless save for the mane that runs around his shoulders and the flapping hide that hangs down the humanoid torso&#39;s back like a macabre cape. Lifeless eyes gaze out from the lupine face, viscous fluid running down to the drool soaked jowls of this demonic machination.
Kolzom the demonic amalgamation looks to be crushingly strong.

Mozlok steps forward to the maelstrom of swirling power, and after considering it for a moment, steps within. The room is crushed by an oppressive darkness as the energy suddenly expands, consuming all within its path.

He is a radiant Diabolus. Black skin striped with red, he is an amalgamation of various parts. His lower body appears to be the quadruped form of a horse-sized pachyderm, while his upper body is mostly humanoid in appearance. His head is that of a hairless wolf, lips curled back as black teeth shine through the snarling visage with long, wicked tusks sprouting out at obscene angles from his drooping jowls. His eyes are little more than tiny red orbs glowering beneath thick brows. From his back sprout mighty wings, massive in their span yet still seemingly small against his grostesque form. Their leathery surface is stretched over thick bones exposed in places to the air, and the remains of diseased feathers fall from their surface. A scaled crocodilian tail extends from his back with boney ridges protruding parallel down its length, ending in a wyverian stinger.

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1692 <eb db> 
He is a radiant Diabolus. Iridescent obsidian scales cover his tall and imposing form, interrupted by serpentine lines of blood red scales that twist and write about themselves like snakes. His body is lithe, and near perfectly proportioned, with tightly coiled muscles stretching beneath his polished scales. The armour he wears appears to crafted more to accentuate the perfection of his ssylsin form, and is comprised elaborate shining metal wrapping around one muscular arm ending in razor sharp metal claws, and a like elaborate piece upon his opposing hip. His immensely tall form appears to absorb the light around him, casting his serpentine face into a darkness. Casting vibrant crimson light from within the darkness, his eyes are garnet orbs split by a sliver of pupil. His brow is wreathed with a wicked crown of polished metal and bone, and his cobra-like hood frames his narrow and wicked face.

He is a radiant Diabolus. Iridescent obsidian scales cover his tall and imposing form, interrupted by serpentine lines of blood red scales that twist and write about themselves like snakes. His body is lithe, and near perfectly proportioned, with tightly coiled muscles stretching beneath his polished scales. The armour he wears appears to crafted more to accentuate the perfection of his ssylsin form, and is comprised elaborate shining metal wrapping around one muscular arm ending in razor sharp metal claws, and a like elaborate piece upon his opposing hip. His immensely tall form appears to absorb the light around him, casting his serpentine face into a darkness. Casting vibrant crimson light from within the darkness, his eyes are garnet orbs split by a sliver of pupil. His brow is wreathed with a wicked crown of polished metal and bone, and his cobra-like hood frames his narrow and wicked face.

Sect Rituals

In order to perform sect rituals, the sect needs to first obtain access to these. To do so, a member with the appropriate privilege can use SECT RITUAL GROUP CHOICES, and SECT RITUAL GROUP SELECT <group>. Selecting a group costs 20% of sect belief.

A sect can focus on up to three groups in addition to the Mobility rituals, which are available to all of them. An undesired group can be removed using SECT RITUAL GROUP FORGET <group>. All sect members lose the associated rituals upon doing so.

The rituals are not available to the sect members immediately, and no sect member is able to make use of all the rituals that a sect has obtained - specialisation between sect members is necessary to obtain the full benefits.

The relevant commands are:
SECT RITUAL LIST
SECT RITUAL FOCUS <group>
SECT RITUAL UNFOCUS <group>

The ritual list displays the list of accessible ritual groups and rituals within each, as well as information about which of these is accessible to the player. Each player is capable of picking a limited number of rituals. Additionally, the 5th ritual in each group requires 2 picks to obtain. Rituals within each group are obtained in order - each focusing on the group grants you the next ritual within that group.

- Each players can obtain up to 4 ritual points
- Upon reaching level 80, additional 2 points can be gained

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1760 <eb db> 
- Upon reaching level 100 (Aspect), additional 3 points become available
- Finally, 2 more points can be obtained using the Aspect perk system (HELP ASPECT PERKS)
- This means that a player can obtain up to 11 rituals, or 10 rituals if one of them is a rank 5 ritual

Each ritual point allows learning one ritual, except for the rank 5 rituals, which require two points each.

To use each of the available points, the player first needs to obtain faith worth roughly 5% of sect belief. Unlike regular faith, this one is not lost upon dying or using rituals. The currently accumulated amount is shown on SECT RITUAL LIST, along with the number of available points. Once the requisite amount is accumulated, a new ritual can be learned. The rank 5 rituals require two points, but cost the same amount of accumulated faith.

Unless stated otherwise, all rituals are performed using PERFORM RITUAL <name>.

Available rituals:

HELP SECT RITUALS PROTECTIVE
HELP SECT RITUALS PILLAR
HELP SECT RITUALS FAVOURS
HELP SECT RITUALS OFFENSIVE
HELP SECT RITUALS MOBILITY
HELP SECT RITUALS SUKHDER

Nodding as everyone takes their place, the ssylsin ritualist pulls a bundle of scrolls from within his robes. He rifles through them quickly before choosing the appropriate scroll and replaces the rest. Opening the scroll with a flourish, he begins to read aloud from the archaic writing, his words foreign and unintelligible.

The flaming marks upon the ground scorch the ground around them, licking out towards your feet as the ssylsin ritualist's voice rises in volume. The air grows heavy and thick, like walking in a dream, as a screaming wail pierces the air above the altar.

The Pit is wrenched open against its will, swirling darkness and screams emanating from within as the writhing arms and appendages of demons and tortured souls reach out to the rent space before them. Energy from the ritual speeds into the darkness, its form taking on the shape of black and red chains that tighten as they appear to catch hold of something...

From the darkest reaches of the pit, a being is brought forth, a grotesquely obese demon with massive lower quarters and a human-like upper body. It struggles against the chains until it sees the rent space between the pit and the mortal plane, then charges forth to emerge from the darkness into this world.

Lyon makes a disimpassioned gesture at his Ouroboros as it spins and quickly dissolves into nothing.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1580 &lt;eb db>
Lyon looks thoughtfully at a grandiose and obese demon's profile, pondering the situation.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1580 &lt;eb db>
The opening to the pit begins to seal itself as reality fights to heal the tear in the veil.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 &lt;eb db>
Dicey draws in a deep smokey breath as her yellow eyes follow the large beast. Her fingers clench slightly tighter on her weaponry.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 &lt;eb db>
The sun climbs to its apex, scattering darkness, illuminating the land with its holy light.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 &lt;eb db>
Mozlok says, "Mozlok will handle this."
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 &lt;eb db>
The end of Dicey's churata glows brightly as she takes a long drag from it.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 &lt;eb db>
Lowering the churata, Dicey exhales creating a train of smoke rings that float lazily into the air.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1582 &lt;eb db>
Mozlok watches the obese demon as it raises its massive maul to strike out at those around them. At the last moment, he strikes out deceivingly fast with the stinger at the end of his crocodilian tail, striking the demon in its face.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1583 &lt;eb db>
You nod your acknowledgement of Mozlok.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1583 &lt;eb db>
The firmament grows darker as the clouds begin to smother the light.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1583 &lt;eb db>
Slowly, the demon's face begins to burn away, and it screams with rage as it once again lifts its maul to strike at its new target, the entity Mozlok. As chunks of his face fall away, Mozlok steps aside as the maul is buried into the ground beside him, narrowly missing the altar.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1584 &lt;eb db>
Sudden movement yields a glimpse of a swamp snake before it darts out of sight.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1585 &lt;eb db>
The ground shakes with the impact of the maul, and causes the rotted stump near the altar to split, sending shards of wood scattering about.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1585 &lt;eb db>
As the demon screams, lifting up his maul to swing again, Mozlok simply steps forward, bringing the bone and iron caber down atop its head, and into the ground far below. The demon's body sags as the weight of death falls upon it.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1586 &lt;eb db>
(Ring): Selthis says, "[Game] Amaris logged in."
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1587 &lt;eb db>
With little care, Mozlok removes his caber from the ground, shaking free bits of what was once the demons face, and tosses the dead body atop the altar, where the four arms of the altar begin tearing the usable pieces away from the scrap, which falls into the toothy maw below. Black blood and viscous gore coat the area in a mist, and the circle below the altar glows as the energy fights to keep the rift in the veil open.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1587 &lt;eb db>
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Ryac.

Ryac rubs some salve on his skin.

Lyon keeping his position near the circle, but shifting his body to place his small buckler between the demon and the entity as the bloody mist rises from their struggle.

Mozlok says, "That was too easy. Mozlok is not amused by this."

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1594 &lt;eb db>
A cowled ssylsin ritualist rubs his hands together as he observes the ritual progress. He reads aloud from a scroll, words flowing together as he enters a haze, the power from the altar pulsing brightly once more, and chains of energy firing into the shrinking rift, forcing it open once more.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1594 &lt;eb db>

The chains tighten as another creature is pulled forth, this one a morbid hybrid between a crocodile and a man that simply stands as the chains of energy pull him forth into this plane through the rift, a wicked blade held in each of his six arms. He glares balefully about the room before charging the chanting ssylsin ritualist.

Dicey seeks to draw in a drag of her churata, only to find it extingued by the wet debris of the battle. She spits it from her mouth, sniffs, and flicks it aside, before blinkingly returning her attention to the goings on.

As the body of the crocodilian demon is placed upon the altar, the metal limbs begin separating the useful body parts from the trash.

A cowled ssylsin ritualist cackles gleefully as he watches the creature being slowly pieced together. He moves on to summon the final beast, reading from his scroll with an insane fervor.

Lyon examines the tooth as he puffs upon his churata, before depositing it into the folds of his surcoat.

Dicey quickly lights up a slender rolled churata.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1617 &lt;eb db>
The tendrils of energy lash out into the gaping rift once more, a keening echoing through the room as the veil pushes against the intrusion. The portal begins to collapse, but then the chains take hold of another beast, pulling it forth from the pit.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1617 &lt;eb db>
A sudden eruption of a distant volcano lightens up the firmament.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1617 &lt;eb db>
Lyon chants rhythmically under his breath.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1617 &lt;eb db>

(Ring): Onaedan says, "Agreed."
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1618 &lt;eb db>
As the third demon emerges, the keening wanes, and the energy holding the rift open begins to stabilize, the wailing and grasping limb from the rift reach out at the almost beastlike demon that steps forth, but all noise covered by the shrieking call it sounds as it charges those who are gathered before it.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1618 &lt;eb db>
The end of Dicey's churata glows brightly as she takes a long drag from it.

Lashing out with its acid tipped stinger, the wyvern-like demon attempts to strike at Mozlok, but he swings his caber into the opposing limb, batting it away as he drives his weapon into its chest.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1619 &lt;eb db>
Lyon ponders the situation.
H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1621 &lt;eb db>
Mozlok brings a heavy caber crashing down atop the head of a wyvern-like demon, and the sound of cracking bone resonates loudly.

H:430(100%) M:456(99%) E:1854 W:1634 &lt;eb db>
Taken from his trance, the ssylsin ritualist ducks to the side at the last minute, the wyvern's teeth barely skimming his back as he rushes towards northeastern exit into the swamp. Mozlok looks at the beast and sighs from boredom, grabbing it by its tail and whipping it back before the altar, slamming the beast into the great mechanism.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1634 &lt;eb db>
As the final demon is placed upon the altar, the hands begin their tireless work once more. Pulling the creature quickly to pieces, the machination then affixes the last of the touches to the creature it has been creating. The tall and lifeless thing complete, the ssylsin ritualist begins to pace back and forth quickly, satisfaction evident upon his face as the creature appears to be a copy of the entity Mozlok.

The energy surrounding the altar begins to change, the light radiating from the circle of power turning a sickly green as a single tendril of malevolent force snakes its way into the rift. A horrific scream is heard, and what is pulled forth appears to be a soul of some sort, a wispy thing that is little more than energy.
H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1645 &lt;eb db>

This monstrous creature radiates an aura of demonic energies in an almost visible shadow that surrounds it with writhing tentacles of darkness. Its body appears to be a combination of a few different creatures held together by large metal stitches that ooze with the demon's black blood. His body is comprised of one great beast that consists of the lower body similar to a great pachyderm, and the upper body of a tanari man, both covered in thick gray flesh. The back of the pachyderm body has a sheet of heavy scaled hide stitched to it like morbid once-living armor, and matching wings sprout from the creatures back, though whether or not they are enough to lift the beast is doubtful. A crocodilian tail sprouts from the rear of the beast, the dual spines running its length tipped in molten gold. Gems are embedded in decorative patterns that line the flanks of the beast, black blood oozing from around them as if they were recently pressed into the thick flesh. His head is that of a great wolf, hairless save for the mane that runs around his shoulders and the flapping hide that hangs down the humanoid torso's back like a macabre cape. Lifeless eyes gaze out from the lupine face, viscous fluid running down to the drool soaked jowls of this demonic machination.
Kolzom the demonic amalgamation looks to be crushingly strong.

With almost graceful motion, the grotesque form of Mozlok lifts the ssylsin ritualist into the air. A popping noise is heard as the lupine jaw of Mozlok unhinges, opening alarmingly wide as he consumes the still living man in a single bite, the ssylsin's screams lost among the wailing turbulence of the rift behind the entity.

With a great flash of vile green light, the rift collapses, sending huge amounts of energy pummeling all within proximity, driving you to your knees. The energy of the circle releases as well, and a great maelstrom of power begins to form near the altar.

The demonic creation, now free from its bindings, begins to fight against the physical chain that ties it to the altar, swinging out wildly at the cult members around it.

Mozlok steps forward to the maelstrom of swirling power, and after considering it for a moment, steps within. The room is crushed by an oppressive darkness as the energy suddenly expands, consuming all within its path.

He is a radiant Diabolus. Black skin striped with red, he is an amalgamation of various parts. His lower body appears to be the quadruped form of a horse-sized pachyderm, while his upper body is mostly humanoid in appearance. His head is that of a hairless wolf, lips curled back as black teeth shine through the snarling visage with long, wicked tusks sprouting out at obscene angles from his drooping jowls. His eyes are little more than tiny red orbs glowering beneath thick brows. From his back sprout mighty wings, massive in their span yet still seemingly small against his grostesque form. Their leathery surface is stretched over thick bones exposed in places to the air, and the remains of diseased feathers fall from their surface. A scaled crocodilian tail extends from his back with boney ridges protruding parallel down its length, ending in a wyverian stinger.

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1692 &lt;eb db>
He is a radiant Diabolus. Iridescent obsidian scales cover his tall and imposing form, interrupted by serpentine lines of blood red scales that twist and write about themselves like snakes. His body is lithe, and near perfectly proportioned, with tightly coiled muscles stretching beneath his polished scales. The armour he wears appears to crafted more to accentuate the perfection of his ssylsin form, and is comprised elaborate shining metal wrapping around one muscular arm ending in razor sharp metal claws, and a like elaborate piece upon his opposing hip. His immensely tall form appears to absorb the light around him, casting his serpentine face into a darkness. Casting vibrant crimson light from within the darkness, his eyes are garnet orbs split by a sliver of pupil. His brow is wreathed with a wicked crown of polished metal and bone, and his cobra-like hood frames his narrow and wicked face.

He is a radiant Diabolus. Iridescent obsidian scales cover his tall and imposing form, interrupted by serpentine lines of blood red scales that twist and write about themselves like snakes. His body is lithe, and near perfectly proportioned, with tightly coiled muscles stretching beneath his polished scales. The armour he wears appears to crafted more to accentuate the perfection of his ssylsin form, and is comprised elaborate shining metal wrapping around one muscular arm ending in razor sharp metal claws, and a like elaborate piece upon his opposing hip. His immensely tall form appears to absorb the light around him, casting his serpentine face into a darkness. Casting vibrant crimson light from within the darkness, his eyes are garnet orbs split by a sliver of pupil. His brow is wreathed with a wicked crown of polished metal and bone, and his cobra-like hood frames his narrow and wicked face.

Sect Rituals
In order to perform sect rituals, the sect needs to first obtain access to these. To do so, a member with the appropriate privilege can use SECT RITUAL GROUP CHOICES, and SECT RITUAL GROUP SELECT &lt;group>. Selecting a group costs 20% of sect belief.
A sect can focus on up to three groups in addition to the Mobility rituals, which are available to all of them. An undesired group can be removed using SECT RITUAL GROUP FORGET &lt;group>. All sect members lose the associated rituals upon doing so.
The rituals are not available to the sect members immediately, and no sect member is able to make use of all the rituals that a sect has obtained - specialisation between sect members is necessary to obtain the full benefits.
The relevant commands are:
SECT RITUAL LIST
SECT RITUAL FOCUS &lt;group>
SECT RITUAL UNFOCUS &lt;group>
The ritual list displays the list of accessible ritual groups and rituals within each, as well as information about which of these is accessible to the player. Each player is capable of picking a limited number of rituals. Additionally, the 5th ritual in each group requires 2 picks to obtain. Rituals within each group are obtained in order - each focusing on the group grants you the next ritual within that group.
- Each players can obtain up to 4 ritual points
- Upon reaching level 80, additional 2 points can be gained

H:430(100%) M:460(100%) E:1854 W:1760 &lt;eb db>
- Upon reaching level 100 (Aspect), additional 3 points become available
- Finally, 2 more points can be obtained using the Aspect perk system (HELP ASPECT PERKS)
- This means that a player can obtain up to 11 rituals, or 10 rituals if one of them is a rank 5 ritual
Each ritual point allows learning one ritual, except for the rank 5 rituals, which require two points each.
To use each of the available points, the player first needs to obtain faith worth roughly 5% of sect belief. Unlike regular faith, this one is not lost upon dying or using rituals. The currently accumulated amount is shown on SECT RITUAL LIST, along with the number of available points. Once the requisite amount is accumulated, a new ritual can be learned. The rank 5 rituals require two points, but cost the same amount of accumulated faith.
Unless stated otherwise, all rituals are performed using PERFORM RITUAL &lt;name>.
Available rituals:
HELP SECT RITUALS PROTECTIVE
HELP SECT RITUALS PILLAR
HELP SECT RITUALS FAVOURS
HELP SECT RITUALS OFFENSIVE
HELP SECT RITUALS MOBILITY
HELP SECT RITUALS SUKHDER
HELP SECT RITUALS MORADEIM
HELP SECT RITUALS ARYANA
