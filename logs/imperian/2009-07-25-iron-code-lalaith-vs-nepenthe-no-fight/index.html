An irresistible force pulls you along to the other end of the prismatic light.
Near the southern end of Unseelie Court.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. This has been marked 
as holy ground. An armoured knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his 
heavy form set to kneel before a fierce lion. A Warden marksman is manning a 
cannon here. He has 100 cannon balls. There are 2 Idrasi wolfriders here. 
Leaning comfortably against a vicious-looking polearm, a Warden lancer stands 
nonetheless ready for battle. There is a small group of charcoal cinders here. 
Drool dripping from the corners of his mouth, a large slobbery dog ambles 
about. A skittish snowshoe hare scampers about underfoot. Gazing serenely from 
its perch, a graceful gyrfalcon surveys the area. Pale eyes shining, a spotted 
lynx paces here restlessly. A dark crow perches nearby, glaring at your every 
move. Eyes alert and claws at the ready, a fierce wolverine stands his ground.
You see exits leading northeast, east (open door), southeast, west (open door),
and northwest (open door).

look
Near the southern end of Unseelie Court.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Nearing the southern 
end of the barren platform that makes up Unseelie Court, a break in the trees 
gives a view of the forest beyond the village, and the dead land beneath the 
trees. Air like cold glass swirls in the wind, with powdery tufts of snow 
kicked up into the air, spun into spirals, and dropped. To the west is a shop, 
its wares surely in as bad shape as the rest of the village. The entire place 
seems not so much dead as frozen. Eyes watch from the branches and shadows, and
gleam with hunger and hate. This has been marked as holy ground. An armoured 
knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel before a
fierce lion. A Warden marksman is manning a cannon here. He has 100 cannon 
balls. There are 2 Idrasi wolfriders here. Leaning comfortably against a

restlessly. A dark crow perches nearby, glaring at your every move. Eyes alert 
and claws at the ready, a fierce wolverine stands his ground. Lalaith 
Vian&#39;Cirith, Ausdauer&#39;s Rage is here, hidden. He wields a throwing axe in his 
left hand and a mirrored obsidian spear in his right.
You see exits leading northeast, east (open door), southeast, west (open door),

Ithaqua: Iron Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Composed by: Harker

The Iron Code
=============
As written by Kabal

This is the law of the wilds. When two beasts have a disagreement within
a pack, they fight for dominance. The beast that wins the trial is
declared to be the victor and has proven itself worthy of its dominance;
the loser has failed and is proven to be the weaker of the two. The same
principle is applied to the sentient.

There is no truer form of communication than mortal combat. Words have
boundaries; there are some thoughts and emotions that words can do no
justice in expressing. The spoken word and written word often tends to
be subjective, allowing it to be twisted and misconstrued, misunderstood
or even misinterpreted. This is the weakness in a set of formalized laws
governing interaction between members of a pack. In our world, we often
see that the written law often fails within a society, due to many
factors that are unknowingly at work against us. Once a verbal battle is
concluded, the sting of harsh words and personal insult still burn
beneath ones skin, giving birth to resentment and malcontent. This is
the breeding ground of social instability, infighting and often
traitorous thoughts and actions. The Iron Code removes these variables
and places two villagers in control of their own fate. There is no
misunderstanding, there is no clouded judgment, and this is predator and
prey, the unending struggle for survival. To the victor go the spoils.

When two villagers have approached the situation from every manner of
reason possible and have arrive at no sound conclusion or agreement, the
two parties will seek out a village elder, often a Hierophant, and
explain the situation before them. If they are not able to reach a sound
resolution, a circle will be drawn upon the ground and both villagers
will enter the circle. The battle will be announced to the entirety of
the village and they will be allowed to watch the argument be settled.
When both villagers are prepared, the Elder will declare the battle to
be on and the two villagers will fight to the death, using the village

more
proper as their arena. When one of the villagers involved in the duel is
slain, the corpse will be handed over to the victor of the duel.
Ithaquan tradition often calls for the winner to embrace the Sacrament
and consume the fallen, a much greater honour and sign of respect that
submerging the corpse within a puddle. Or, in the ultimate sign of
disrespect, the victor may leave the corpse for the carrion creatures,
refusing to take part in the Sacrament.

The Iron Code is a tool to be used to settle disputes between villagers.
It is not however, there to quell the bloodlust of a feral cretin or to
amuse those to thick headed to find something better to do with there
time. Any abuse of the Iron Code will be met with the Wrath of the Elder
Council. There is no place for a rabid beast who would attack its kin
without rhyme or reason.

Near the southern end of Unseelie Court.
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. 
Nearing the southern end of the barren platform that makes up Unseelie Court, a
break in the trees gives a view of the forest beyond the village, and the dead 
land beneath the trees. Air like cold glass swirls in the wind, with powdery 
tufts of snow kicked up into the air, spun into spirals, and dropped. To the 
west is a shop, its wares surely in as bad shape as the rest of the village. 
The entire place seems not so much dead as frozen. Eyes watch from the branches
and shadows, and gleam with hunger and hate. This has been marked as holy 
ground. An armoured knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form 
set to kneel before a fierce lion. A Warden marksman is manning a cannon here. 
He has 100 cannon balls. There are 2 Idrasi wolfriders here. Leaning 
comfortably against a vicious-looking polearm, a Warden lancer stands 
nonetheless ready for battle. Drool dripping from the corners of his mouth, a 
large slobbery dog ambles about. A skittish snowshoe hare scampers about 
underfoot. Gazing serenely from its perch, a graceful gyrfalcon surveys the 
area. Pale eyes shining, a spotted lynx paces here restlessly. A dark crow 
perches nearby, glaring at your every move. Eyes alert and claws at the ready, 
a fierce wolverine stands his ground. A young wolf pup romps playfully in the 
corner, unaware of the dangerous world it lives in. An&#39;sheri Jhanna Typhus is 
here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a sleek javelin in her 
right. Red Lioness, Nepenthe Bercalion-El&#39;Zaahir, Fang of Ilarua is here, 
listening intently. Lalaith Vian&#39;Cirith, Ausdauer&#39;s Rage is here, hidden. He 
wields a tower shield in his left hand and a mirrored obsidian spear in his 
right. An&#39;sheri Rudha Viantha, of Ukume is here. She wields a truesilver shield
in her left hand and a sleek javelin in her right.
You see exits leading northeast, east (open door), southeast, west (open door),

Ithaqua: Iron Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Composed by: Harker

The Iron Code
=============
As written by Kabal
This is the law of the wilds. When two beasts have a disagreement within
a pack, they fight for dominance. The beast that wins the trial is
declared to be the victor and has proven itself worthy of its dominance;
the loser has failed and is proven to be the weaker of the two. The same
principle is applied to the sentient.
There is no truer form of communication than mortal combat. Words have
boundaries; there are some thoughts and emotions that words can do no
justice in expressing. The spoken word and written word often tends to
be subjective, allowing it to be twisted and misconstrued, misunderstood
or even misinterpreted. This is the weakness in a set of formalized laws
governing interaction between members of a pack. In our world, we often
see that the written law often fails within a society, due to many
factors that are unknowingly at work against us. Once a verbal battle is
concluded, the sting of harsh words and personal insult still burn
beneath ones skin, giving birth to resentment and malcontent. This is
the breeding ground of social instability, infighting and often
traitorous thoughts and actions. The Iron Code removes these variables
and places two villagers in control of their own fate. There is no
misunderstanding, there is no clouded judgment, and this is predator and
prey, the unending struggle for survival. To the victor go the spoils.
When two villagers have approached the situation from every manner of
reason possible and have arrive at no sound conclusion or agreement, the
two parties will seek out a village elder, often a Hierophant, and
explain the situation before them. If they are not able to reach a sound
resolution, a circle will be drawn upon the ground and both villagers
will enter the circle. The battle will be announced to the entirety of
the village and they will be allowed to watch the argument be settled.
When both villagers are prepared, the Elder will declare the battle to
be on and the two villagers will fight to the death, using the village

more
proper as their arena. When one of the villagers involved in the duel is
slain, the corpse will be handed over to the victor of the duel.
Ithaquan tradition often calls for the winner to embrace the Sacrament
and consume the fallen, a much greater honour and sign of respect that
submerging the corpse within a puddle. Or, in the ultimate sign of
disrespect, the victor may leave the corpse for the carrion creatures,
refusing to take part in the Sacrament.
The Iron Code is a tool to be used to settle disputes between villagers.
It is not however, there to quell the bloodlust of a feral cretin or to
amuse those to thick headed to find something better to do with there
time. Any abuse of the Iron Code will be met with the Wrath of the Elder
Council. There is no place for a rabid beast who would attack its kin
without rhyme or reason.

Near the southern end of Unseelie Court.
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey.
Nearing the southern end of the barren platform that makes up Unseelie Court, a
break in the trees gives a view of the forest beyond the village, and the dead
land beneath the trees. Air like cold glass swirls in the wind, with powdery
tufts of snow kicked up into the air, spun into spirals, and dropped. To the
west is a shop, its wares surely in as bad shape as the rest of the village.
The entire place seems not so much dead as frozen. Eyes watch from the branches
and shadows, and gleam with hunger and hate. This has been marked as holy
ground. An armoured knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form
set to kneel before a fierce lion. A Warden marksman is manning a cannon here.
He has 100 cannon balls. There are 2 Idrasi wolfriders here. Leaning
comfortably against a vicious-looking polearm, a Warden lancer stands
nonetheless ready for battle. Drool dripping from the corners of his mouth, a
large slobbery dog ambles about. A skittish snowshoe hare scampers about
underfoot. Gazing serenely from its perch, a graceful gyrfalcon surveys the
area. Pale eyes shining, a spotted lynx paces here restlessly. A dark crow
perches nearby, glaring at your every move. Eyes alert and claws at the ready,
a fierce wolverine stands his ground. A young wolf pup romps playfully in the
corner, unaware of the dangerous world it lives in. An'sheri Jhanna Typhus is
here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a sleek javelin in her
right. Red Lioness, Nepenthe Bercalion-El'Zaahir, Fang of Ilarua is here,
listening intently. Lalaith Vian'Cirith, Ausdauer's Rage is here, hidden. He
wields a tower shield in his left hand and a mirrored obsidian spear in his
right. An'sheri Rudha Viantha, of Ukume is here. She wields a truesilver shield
in her left hand and a sleek javelin in her right.
You see exits leading northeast, east (open door), southeast, west (open door),
