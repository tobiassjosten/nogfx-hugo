Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small sign points into a market 
stall. The towering presence of Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate 
the room here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A fearsome lion prowls around 
here and greets you with a warning roar. Gleaming slightly, a sturdy shortsword
is here. A scruffy grey alley cat sits here pointedly ignoring you as it cleans
its fur. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his surroundings. 
Preening her wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. Warily pacing 
around, a golden-headed lion tamarin darts between your feet. Alert to any 
danger, a striped ocelot paces around. Its head ever moving to catch any sound,
a leathery black bat hangs nearby. An anteater plods about bristling angrily. A
narimer flicks it's tail in agitation on being discovered. Hands of rotting 
flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Knight of Vahin, Lord Aidan 
Askare, The Blade of Justice is riding on a massive warhorse named Bowin. He 
wields a truesilver broadsword in each hand. Lusien Askare, Sentinel of the 
Wilds is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a throwing axe in 
his right. Templar Drongon Vuh'uni, Holy Defender is here. He wields a curved 
sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The spring of
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal
light a source of inspiration and life. A small sign points into a market
stall. The towering presence of Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate
the room here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A fearsome lion prowls around
here and greets you with a warning roar. Gleaming slightly, a sturdy shortsword
is here. A scruffy grey alley cat sits here pointedly ignoring you as it cleans
its fur. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his surroundings.
Preening her wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. Warily pacing
around, a golden-headed lion tamarin darts between your feet. Alert to any
danger, a striped ocelot paces around. Its head ever moving to catch any sound,
a leathery black bat hangs nearby. An anteater plods about bristling angrily. A
narimer flicks it's tail in agitation on being discovered. Hands of rotting
flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Knight of Vahin, Lord Aidan
Askare, The Blade of Justice is riding on a massive warhorse named Bowin. He
wields a truesilver broadsword in each hand. Lusien Askare, Sentinel of the
Wilds is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a throwing axe in
his right. Templar Drongon Vuh'uni, Holy Defender is here. He wields a curved
sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway
leads down.
