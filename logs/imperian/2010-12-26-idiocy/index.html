The mages tried back pedaling, said it was only for a month and was supposed to be secret and wanted the traitors name who told me. I refused, I took Duke cause frankly, having one guild think they are above the city? Ludicrious. I get it, make my post, which was...


To make a few things clear,

I did not ask to become Duke with a cheerful heart. It was reluctant but I felt it had to be done. There are several things that worried me over the year but at last too much has happened for me to sit back.

One, as I posted earlier, the Mage leadership was preparing to ban the bards guild from the alchemy lab. This was supposed to be secret but someone was brave enough to tell me. They not only said that, but called the bards traitors, subversives and the like. There is reasonable guild secrets and policies, but this is not one of them. If any guild was going to do such a thing as this, then one should tell and not be silent. I refused to name the person who told me and the name or names will never be said.

Each guild is a part of the city, not greater then it. When guild goes up against city, the Duchy shall triumph, no matter which guild it is. The alchemy room is a vital resource for the city at large. The mage guild can and should regulate it against those who misuse it, but to deny it to an entire guild of the city is not something that can stand. Deny it to traitors who sell alchemy, deny it to city enemies, but as long as someone is in good standing in the Duchy, they should have reasonable access to alchemy and they will by my word. If they sell it to those that should not have it, they will be denied access, enemied and ousted if they are a citizen. The guilds will support the Duchy, but when Duchy comes in conflict with guild, the Duchy shall triumph, for an arm can not claim primacy over the rest of the body. That is foolishness and can not stand.

Furthermore, to quote from our canon,

II.
An Erege has the capability of overriding any minister at any time.

III.
During extenuating circumstances, an Erege may give an executive order
to any citizen or group of citizens. The citizen or group of citizens
must obey that order as long as it does not violate Canon Law.

IV.
An Erege has the power to interpret Canon Law, subject to being
overridden by the Duchess, Duke, or the Council of Ereges.

No more will any minister over rule an Erege, unless a plurality of the council agrees. No more will someone with higher authority verbally authorise one to do such an action and not leave note before it happens. There are laws and a clear chain of command. If someone is abusing authority, we have means to deal with that. If someone is in a ministry and abusing it, an Erege or the Duke, me, will deal with it. So to clarify, no verbal authorizations, he or she said I could discipline someone who is in a higher position of authority. And that is the end of that.

Finally, all ministry positions are now open, send me a letter if you wish to have a job and current ministers let me know if you want to keep your job and give me reasons why you should keep it.

That is all.

And then my third supporter caves and gives it back to Sorin.

You recall that Sorin said:
"Leave it Ivellios. I will no longer spar with you over this issue. I will no 
longer allow any minister, or official take it upon themselves to destroy the 
peace in this city for the "Good" of the duchy. We are a city embodied by 
Individuals. And in order to make sure things work as they do, we cannot let 
our personal lives rule us, or our decisions. It must be our laws, not our 
vindictiveness. Learn that lessons please."

You recall that Mathiaus said:

Yes, Sorin thinks its fine for a minister to over ride an erege and to have the mage guild run amuck. And people don&#39;t see how ludicrious it is.'>2010/12/21 11:23:42 - Mikihide > At this time alchemy is restricted to Bards

The &ldquo;retraction " of said policy was posted on the mage secretary clan logs, not to the guild as a whole like the ban was. I was disfavoured for &ldquo;slandering&rdquo; Mikihide by posting his log and saying if this was implemented, Mages would have to pay full price for artistry items. And when Vanmoriel wanted to speak as an Erege and bard secretary on the matter, Dias refused to let her speak, moved the meeting with Nasr and myself to his home in Kaark, which fails every security measure cause at least two rooms weren&rsquo;t totemed and monlithed. And when she moradeimed in, Dias told her she had 30 seconds to get out or else. He threatened to kill an Erege who has all the powers of the ministry&rsquo;s including housing, so if she wanted to look at his house, she could, and he threatened her with violence. And I still couldn&rsquo;t keep the position. For crying out loud, I didn&rsquo;t even immediately oust and enemy people, I was going to keep it lawful, unlike what they are doing.

Your attacks on my personal life are nil, and done. I&rsquo;m not a retard, though I&rsquo;ve worked with children with special needs so I take that quite offensively. I&rsquo;ve asked you to leave me alone in game, out of game, and everywhere else, so please do.

So no, I don&rsquo;t black out. I get to remember most of my seizures. They really, really suck. Except the kind that I shared in my log. That one was cool.

Duke and Erege will always over-ride the Minister of War or Minister of Defense. Ivellios and Vanmoriel are especially known for the abusive type of action during anything. I am not going to lie, I have told citizens to get the eff in the sewers so that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about the gank squad grabbing them while I try to guard-rush or vortex them out. Ivellios is especially in favor of using the &ldquo;I r Erege, therefor I r never wrongz.&rdquo; Same goes for Vanmoriel. I find the elections hilarious, yeah, I was face raped with votes, but we don&rsquo;t have near that many active citizens, and I have been online at all hours of the day in the past month, and not seen that many&mldr;.
