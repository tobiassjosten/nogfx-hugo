In the trees above A junction of Wendigo catwalk. (Ithaquan Council.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Inside the village, a broad and well maintained catwalk runs in a wide circle. The pathway stretches from limb to limb, reaching out to the east and west. Across a wide open expanse, the far side of the catwalk can be seen threaded through dense and foreboding growth. The branches of the huge pines here are rimed with frost, great icicles hanging from every thick limb like savage knives. A sign is carved into the thickest tree, marked with one word: "Wendigo." A cloud of smoke fills the area, coming from a campfire in the center of a campground. Yousee exits leading north, east, south, and west.
