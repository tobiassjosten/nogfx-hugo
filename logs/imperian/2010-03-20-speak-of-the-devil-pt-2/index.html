Right after being killed by Lyon in an attempt to jump him as Alexio, Enteri 
whom is the alt of Alexio, appears to kill Lyon. He says both have grounds to 
kill me, but the time frame and the circumstances scream metagaming. I 
generally like to avoid conflicts that can not be resolved in character, but 
this was extremely blatant.

You sent the following message to Alexio: When did I team you? We ate a totem 
outside of Stavenn, and you came with Xavia and Curdy.
Alexio would like you to know that: The accumulated filth of all their sex and 
murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will 
look up and shout "Save Us!"...and I&#39;ll look down, and whisper, "No".
