In the center of the pentacle. (Wytchen Guildhall.)
This gray granite chamber is pentagonal in shape, the rounded, rune-inscribed 
ceiling arcing high overhead. Footsteps, speech and even breathing is intently 
amplified, echoing off the smooth stone walls. The floor is an intricate mural;
formed of polished bits of semi-precious stone and metal, it is an elaborate 
depiction of Thau&#39;Ris, guardian Spirit of the Wytchen Fortress. He lies upon 
the floor in artistic splendor, his arms and legs stretched wide. Portals 
flanked by ornate black iron torches branch off in the five cardinal 
directions, the glow from the torches reflecting off the shimmering bits of the
mosaic form, the flickering light occasionally lending the illusion of subtle 
movement. A glass table floats silently in the air. A curved sofa upholstered 
in sapphire blue silk sits here. Soft tinkling sounds come from the shimmering 
crystals dangling from the edges of a hammock here. A heavy wooden chest 
reinforced with steel plates, stands along one wall. Puffy white cotton cumulus
clouds stand out from the muted blues of the oval rug here. Dark red pillows 
contrasting with the inky black velvet, a plush sofa sits here looking rather 
comfortable. Crystal beads dangle from the comfortably cushioned hammock 
hanging here, the gems sparkling like stars as they catch stray light. A 
dubious sculpture of Salish towers here. A sigil in the shape of a small, 
rectangular monolith is on the ground. The crumbled leather scroll lies exposed
to the elements. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. His fur a 
dusky ash colour, Ashen sits quietly in one corner. Zeldia Melloryn is here, 
dancing with dazzling footwork. Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems is
here. He wields a fire opal engagement ring in his left hand and a living vodun
doll of Zeldia in his right. Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux is here.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux chuckles darkly.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "I am not a poor little elf."

-Salish cursing Zeldia a bunch-

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Nooooooooooo."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Your appearance betrays you, then."

Salish ceases to wield a fire opal engagement ring in his left hand.

Salish begins to wield a curved sabre in his left hand.

Zeldia uses her right foot to stomp on her left as hard as possible.

With a lightning-quick motion, Salish slashes Zeldia with a curved sabre.

Salish swings a curved sabre powerfully at Zeldia.

With the heel of her palm, Zeldia smacks herself upside the head.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Goodnight, my poor elf."

Zeldia smiles as she rams her fist into her jaw.

Lyon&#39;s forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.

With the heel of her palm, Zeldia smacks herself upside the head.
Zeldia has been slain by Salish.
Zeldia drops some golden sovereigns onto the ground.

Salish gives a horrified gasp.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I did masochism.."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I&#39;m stupid.."

Overcome by death, Zeldia&#39;s spirit fades to grey.

"Yep," Lyon says with indifferent finality.

You ask, in Ssylsin, "Did you not intend to kill her?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Nope."

"Heh heh heh," Salish chuckles.

Lyon&#39;s forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.

Your features set in a demonic grin of pure malevolence, you cry a gleeful 
prayer to the forces of darkness and plunge your hand deep into Zeldia&#39;s chest.
You grip the still-warm and faintly beating heart that lies within, and wrench 
it free from its nest of arteries and veins. Your arm bathed and dripping with 
the lifeblood of your victim, you hold aloft the wretched organ as a testament 
to the power of pure evil.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I&#39;ll resurrect &#39;er."

Salish places a doll of Zeldia on the ground and places his hands on it and 
closes his eyes in concentration. He slowly backs away from the doll which 
begins to writhe and twist on the ground, slowly growing into the unharmed body
of Zeldia.

With a quick prayer, Salish expertly fashions some rope and cloth into the 
rough semblance of a humanoid.

-Salish fashioning the rest of the doll-

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You&#39;ll be more respectful, now won&#39;t 
you?"

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Who asked you for your input anyway."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "This is between me and Salish only."

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Salish is our Lord, ruler of the cotorie, and god of 
the wytchen!"

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Quiet yourself, tool."

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "I did not say that."

(Wytchen): Maxia says, "Doll."

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "You are all pitiful fools. Refusing to bow down before
the might of the Empire will result in our ultimate destruction. Bow before 
Lord Salish, Lord Lyon, and the might of the Empire, or suffer."

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Yea."

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Damn Dias is not about."

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Maxia, your children are not safe, no one is safe. I 
am Lord Salish, the destroyer."

You tell Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems, in Ssylsin, "(Wytchen): 
Zeldia says, "Damn Dias is not about."."

Salish covers the ears and eyes of a doll of Zeldia.

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "He made me ignore tells."

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "How to i get it back i forgot."

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Ok never mind."

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Dias is a joke, he could not take the mighty Lord 
Salish.. All bow before our Lord!"

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "I am weak, and honored to even be in the same room as 
our Lord, the destroyer, Lord Salish."

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "War shall consume your pitiful existance. Plague shall
run wild through your family and friends. Your children shall be consumed, your
women shall be raped, and your men hung from their own home. None shall be 
safe."

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "This is not true at least the weak part is anyway."

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "This is all a lie don&#39;t believe it."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "This festering hole smells of children."

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Thats cause there are some here."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, in Ssylsin, "Find &#39;em, and 
kill them."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I&#39;ll do better."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Have you ever tasted children, my 
friend?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Sounds delightful, 
but I haven&#39;t."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Their flesh is just so tender."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Don&#39;t mess with Maxia&#39;s kids."

Salish grins mischievously.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "She&#39;ll be short a child, soon."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "How could you be so cruel."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You brought it upon your own self."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "How did I bring it upon myseld."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You can ponder that as you suffer, 
tool."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I&#39;m going to search for my snack."

Lyon leaves to the east.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Can&#39;t wait."

Lyon arrives from the east.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "My my, I think I&#39;ve found one."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Did you find one?"

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Salish rubs his hands together greedily and mutters, "Eeexxcellent..."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Let the kid go."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux sinisterly raises a small Lycaean pup, the hound 
wimpering in fear.

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Let him go."

Without hesitation you cram the heart into your mouth and sink your fangs into 
the juicy flesh. As the blood bursts out from inside it, you feel your dark 
power growing as you absorb the life essence of your victim.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Did I tell you to speak?"

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Sorry Lord."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Do you prefer we kill it here, or 
there?"

Lyon snorts arrogantly.

Throwing back her head, Zeldia screams agonizingly.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Where ever."

You see Zeldia Melloryn yell, "No."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Leave the pup alone."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "I can&#39;t think of anything more deserving
of this miserable hound then dying infront of those who seek to defend it."

Lyon snorts arrogantly.

Zeldia slaps Lyon on the cheek.

Lyon curls his lip and sneers arrogantly.

Salish ties up a doll of Zeldia with a piece of string.

Zeldia has writhed free of her entanglement by ropes.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux snarls, "Salish, control your pet."


Salish utters a short prayer, and then breaks all four limbs on his doll of 
Zeldia.
Zeldia&#39;s eyes roll back in her head as all of her limbs are suddenly shattered 
in multiple places.

-Insert Salish vodun mangling her here-

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Now, where were we.."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux places the pup upon the ground, staring intently upon the
scampering critter. Howls of agony and terror engulf the surrounding as blood 
beings to pour from the tiny creature, its existance drawing to a halting stop.

Zeldia whispers to you, "Can&#39;t you do anything here."

Salish puts a doll of Zeldia up to his ear and listens closely.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "I&#39;d prefer a knife, but this will do."

You tell Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux, in Ssylsin, "Now find the others. Kill them 
all."

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Calling on your dark power, you draw a thick shroud of concealment about 
yourself to cover your every action.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "How many of these vermin are there?"

You shake your head at Zeldia.

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "I would rather not say."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Make her."

You tell Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux, in Ssylsin, "Come down a moment."

Lyon arrives from the up.

You quickly toss a wicked-looking daegger to Lyon, who catches it nimbly.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Thanks man."

You nod your head.

Lyon begins to wield a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand.

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Six in all."

Lyon arrives from the down.

Comprehension flashes across Salish&#39;s face.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Six."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "No there isnt."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "My my, look at this one."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "No."

Zeldia whispers to you, "Why not."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "I think it may be an Akrabi."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Don&#39;t you just dispise bugs?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Now you know I do."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Its not a bug."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Silence."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "No."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Squash it."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Your correct."

You tell Zeldia Melloryn, "I have no equipment. I cannot fight them."


Zeldia tells you, "They are killing Maxi."


Lyon nods his head.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux places the child upon the ground, next to the already 
slain pup, and places his foot upon it. A malign smirk overtakes his features 
as he raises the other foot and speedily brings it down upon the skull of the 
child, killing it in a mass of blood and brain matter.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Why are you killing her children?"

Zeldia shakes her head.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "They are worthless from their mother and
father. I&#39;m doing the world a favor."

Tears fill Zeldia&#39;s eyes and begin to slowly run down her face.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Zeldia, "Yes, cry."

Lyon strokes Zeldia tenderly.

Lyon whispers something to Zeldia.

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Why are you stroking me you don&#39;t care about 
me."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux chuckles darkly, turning to find more children.

Lyon leaves to the west.

Zeldia Melloryn says to Salish, "Why are you letting him do this."

"Heh heh heh," Salish chuckles.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Why should I stop him?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Why do you think I even 
brought him?"

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Tell me Maxia, do you love your children? Or I guess I
should say, did you love your children? They where very crunchy if you must 
know."

Lyon arrives from the west.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux drops two tiny wolf pups upon the ground next to the 
other victims, their forms bruised and bound by rope.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "You know what is a custom in Ithaqua?"

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Salish gives Lyon an acknowledging nod.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Salish, "Cannibalism."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "But, I don&#39;t like my victims plain."

With a pointed stick, Salish begins sketching a rune on the ground.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Your nasty."

A wall of rough stone rises from the earth to block the exit to the down.

You tell Zeldia Melloryn, "Where iss Maxia? Why iss she not protecting her 
children?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I cold get some salt, if 
you&#39;d prefer?"

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "For you see, roasting brings out the 
flavor."

Zeldia tells you, "I dont know she won&#39;t respond to me i tried."

Salish nods his head.

Lyon coughs softly.

Zeldia vomits up the contents of her stomach.

Zeldia pukes all over Lyon.

Lyon slaps Zeldia on the cheek.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Control your stomach, my dear."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You&#39;ll be the one presenting my mess."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "I could if you wouldn&#39;t do that here."

Lyon rolls his eyes.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Too bad, I&#39;m going to make a display."

Zeldia vomits the contents of her stomach onto Lyon.

Lyon gives a pained sigh.

Lyon stares at Zeldia, giving her the evil eye.
Zeldia&#39;s eyes close suddenly as she falls asleep.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Much better."

Zeldia opens her eyes and yawns mightily.

Zeldia spits in Lyon&#39;s face.

Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.

-Salish afflicting her some more-

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Ok ok."

With a lightning-quick motion, Salish slashes Zeldia with a curved sabre.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "I&#39;ll stop."

Salish nods his head.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux sparks his tinderbox, moving the flickering fire closer 
to the bound pups. It ignites their fur, and howls of terror and agony ring 
through the halls. As the corpses blacken and char, Lyon casually picks up a 
bloated body, and savagely chomps in to the burnt flesh.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Slightly overdone."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "It&#39;ll do, never had
mutt before."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Try some."

Lyon takes a drink from a dark black vial with silver stars.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Now, lets see..."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems puts his foot on the body of a 
burnt pup&#39;s body, and tears off a leg with his hand.

"Ewwwwwwwww!" says Zeldia in disgust.

Lyon cackles hellishly.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "You are all sick in the head."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Savour all the flavour these things 
hold."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems examines the the pup leg for a 
moment, picks off a patch of fur and takes a bite.

Zeldia tells you, "I think maxia is off in dream world somewhere."

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Leave enough for my corpse pile."

A great weight seems to have been lifted from Salish.

Salish rubs some salve on his skin.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "It will be my crowning achievment."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Did you find them all."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Regardless, that&#39;s four so far, right?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says "Not that bad." while chewing
the meat still in his mouth.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Aye."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "That is sickening."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Two more, hmmm..."

Lyon leaves to the north.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "There isnt six."

Lyon arrives from the north.

Lyon viciously smacks Zeldia about the chops.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "I am telling the truth."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Zeldia, "Your a riot, you know that."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "That I am aware of there is not six."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Did you find another."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux snarls, "Don&#39;t lie to me, tool."


Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Just one, another one of those bug children."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "I am not to my knowledge."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems gets on top of Zeldia and forces a
pup leg bone into her mouth.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "Shush."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "How would you feel if that was your kid and an 
enemy did that to one of them."

The wall of stone to the down suddenly collapses under its own massive weight.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Who would dare?"

Lyon smirks.

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "No me but just saying."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux releases the bound body of an Akrabi upon the floor, 
laughing insanely.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Salish, "I love how these squish under
my boot."

You tell Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux, "Pry the chitin off of it with the daegger, 

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I think this one should die slowly 
though."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Agreed."


Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Or better, live to suffer the death of 
its kin."

A great weight seems to have been lifted from Salish.

Salish rubs some salve on his skin.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems puts a foot lightly on the chest 
of the akrabi kid.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I&#39;ll hold it here, go find 
the other."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "No."

Lyon&#39;s forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "The oldest one?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Aye."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Leave the oldest alone."

Salish gives Zeldia a wry smile, his eyes lighting up deviously.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I&#39;d like to finish my project, first."

Lyon slaps Zeldia on the cheek.

Salish gives Lyon an acknowledging nod.

"Ouch!", Zeldia shrieks in pain.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You&#39;ve been caught in your own lie, 
tool."

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "The flesh of your younglings is very tender, Maxia. 
I&#39;m enjoying this."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux bends over, casually wedging his daegger under the chitin
of the child. Slowly, he removes a piece from the neck, which bleeds heavily. 
He continues down the neck, until it is bare and raw.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Don&#39;t you just dispise chitters?"

"Ewwwwwwwww!" says Zeldia in disgust.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "That stupid sound they make?"

(Wytchen): Maxia says, "16."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Aye."

(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "16 what."

Lyon smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

It is the 5th day of Vita, in the year 569 AD.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux savagely jabs two fingers in to the neck of the child, 
twisting its vocal cords before removing a bloodied hand. Laughing darkly, he 
slices the mandibles from the child, leaving it gurgling in pain.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "This one will bleed to death."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "How mean."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux violently kicks the body towards the pile, its limp body 
flailing randomly.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "One more, one more."

Lyon rubs his hands together greedily and mutters, "Eeexxcellent..."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "I hope when you have children they die in the 
same way."

Lyon slaps Zeldia on the cheek.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Enjoy that I haven&#39;t slain you yet, 
fool."

(Wytchen): Maxia says, "And they will remain safe."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "I am not a fool."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "And, on top of that, I treat you to a 
glorious spectacle? You ungrateful gnat."

Salish takes up a living vodun doll of Zeldia in his left hand.

Salish begins to wield a curved sabre in his right hand.

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn slams her face into a near puddle of pup blood.

Zeldia vomits the contents of her stomach onto Salish.

Lyon whispers something to Zeldia.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Sorry."

Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.

Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.

Salish takes a drink from a golden tree vial.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "One more, one more."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "No."

Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Quite problematic, isn&#39;t it?"

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Should it live? Should it die?"

You say to Lyon, in Ssylsin, "All life dies, aye?"

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "You should be the one to die."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "As it should."

Lyon&#39;s forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Is it right for me to judge over this creatures life?"

You say, "The sstrong have alwayss ssubjugated the weak.."

Zeldia blushes as she hides her face in her hands in embarrassment.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "I suppose I have my answer then."

Zeldia wrinkles her nose and sniffs.

Lyon leaves to the up.

Lyon arrives from the up.

Zeldia whispers something to Salish.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "You took 
advantage of my love, and now it&#39;s turned, and soured."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Salish, "How did I take advantage of it."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux returns with the bruised and bloodied body of a large 
Lycaen held over his shoulder, the dog howling and screaming in pain and 
suffering. He drops it upon the ground, then smirks silently.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "Enough, watch the
show."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "This one put up a bit of a fight."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Well duh she is over 18."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "It&#39;s part of the 
wytchen, couldn&#39;t have been that much of one."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "And capable of putting up a fight."

Lyon smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Lyon looks sternly at Zeldia and shushes her.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "This is making me sik to my stomach."

Zeldia Melloryn exclaims to Lyon, "NO!!"

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Well you see, when I was a child, I was 
part of an experiment."

Lyon fidgets impatiently.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "They poked me, they prodded me."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "That doesn&#39;t suprise me."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Salish, "They even went as far to take
my eyes out."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "They must have screwed up your brain somewhere."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "I think they took the brain as well and forgot to put 
one in."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I was young, and foolish."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "And you still are foolish."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I fought what they had gifted me with."

Lyon fidgets impatiently.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "You see, the eyes are very powerful."

Salish tilts his head and listens intently to Lyon.

Zeldia Melloryn says, "Gifted."

Zeldia says, "Psh!" derisively as she waves her hand dismissing the idea.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "They can channel a very powerful magick,
or betray your true feelings."

Zeldia Melloryn says, "This is a bunch of hogwash."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I&#39;m not giving this child that chance."

Lyon fidgets impatiently.

Throwing back her head, Zeldia screams agonizingly.

Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia tilts her head and listens intently to Lyon.

Throwing back her head, Zeldia screams agonizingly.

Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux narrates to Salish as he steps toward the panting body, 
raising his blade to commit his next act. "You see, eyes can be easily 
removed...", he says as he prods the right eye of the child, which promptly 
releases of its socket. "With a little pressure, you see...", he mumbles as he 
stabs the left eye, removing it cleanly.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "You can pull them out nice and easy."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux bends over again, severing the cords which connect the 
eyes. He picks them up, then hands them to Zeldia.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You have something to show their mother 
now."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "And finally.."

Zeldia Melloryn drops both eyeballs on the floor in disust.


You have emoted: Airen coils his tail around the eyeballs, keeping them from 
being smashed and shakes his head.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux severs the bloodied face of the Lycaean viciously with 
his hands, the spine snapping as he twists the head off in a bloody mess.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "And now, we&#39;re done."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "You are a real sicko."

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Not to mention a real jerk."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux casually kicks the corpse to the body pile, blood and 
gore colouring the floor.

Lyon rolls his eyes at Zeldia.

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Just like your brother."

Lyon gives a snake-like hiss.

Salish smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Oh did I hit a sensitive spot."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "Talking about 
brothers are we?"

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "This worm deserves treatment."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "May I?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "It was your 
brother who first allowed me into this guildhall."

Your daegger comes racing towards you, stopping unnaturally quickly to land in 
your grasp.

Salish shrugs helplessly at Lyon.

Zeldia Melloryn says to Salish, "And your point being."

Salish gives Zeldia a wry smile, his eyes lighting up deviously.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "The only cure for such ignorance and 
blatant disrespect is death."

Salish utters a curse at a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia seems to be moving in slow motion suddenly.

Salish nods his head at Lyon, showing his acceptance.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Allow me."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I&#39;m done with &#39;er."

Salish urges Lyon onwards.

Lyon stares at Zeldia, giving her the evil eye.

Blood begins to slowly drip from Zeldia&#39;s nose.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles impishly and says, "The plague is a nifty 
affliction."

Zeldia coughs suddenly, expelling black fluid with bits of what looks to be 
tissue suspended in it.

Zeldia trembles slightly as a yellow jaundice begins to creep through her 
now-pale features.

You watch in horror as blood begins to seep from every pore in Zeldia&#39;s body.

Zeldia begins to convulse, and as her mouth opens in a silent scream, you hear 
a loud snapping as her back shatters from the sheer force of the spasms.
Zeldia has been slain by Lyon.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Much better."

Lyon picks up the corpse of Zeldia.

Overcome by death, Zeldia&#39;s spirit fades to grey.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Thank you for your assistance."

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Drop the corpse."

You nod your head.

Lyon drops the corpse of Zeldia.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I&#39;ll decapitate it for 
you."

Lyon claps his hands together merrily.

Salish begins chopping away at the neck of the corpse of Zeldia with a curved 
sabre.

Salish finishes decapitating the corpse of Zeldia, leaving only a pool of blood
where the head had been.

Lyon picks up the decapitated head of Zeldia.

Lyon pets the decapitated head of Zeldia ingratiatingly.

You flick your forked tongue out briefly, testing the air.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says, "Now I have a momemento for all the fun 
we had today."

You say, in Ssylsin, "As do I, it seems."

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Do enjoy those."

You have emoted: Airen kneels and picks up the eyes, tucking them away in his 
robes.

Salish bows respectfully to Lyon.

Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Time to leave?"

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to you, "Would you mind 
letting him out?"

You beckon to Lyon.

Lyon begins to follow you.

"Farewell," Salish says, raising a hand fondly.'>Note: This log is from Airen's point of view.
In the center of the pentacle. (Wytchen Guildhall.)
This gray granite chamber is pentagonal in shape, the rounded, rune-inscribed
ceiling arcing high overhead. Footsteps, speech and even breathing is intently
amplified, echoing off the smooth stone walls. The floor is an intricate mural;
formed of polished bits of semi-precious stone and metal, it is an elaborate
depiction of Thau'Ris, guardian Spirit of the Wytchen Fortress. He lies upon
the floor in artistic splendor, his arms and legs stretched wide. Portals
flanked by ornate black iron torches branch off in the five cardinal
directions, the glow from the torches reflecting off the shimmering bits of the
mosaic form, the flickering light occasionally lending the illusion of subtle
movement. A glass table floats silently in the air. A curved sofa upholstered
in sapphire blue silk sits here. Soft tinkling sounds come from the shimmering
crystals dangling from the edges of a hammock here. A heavy wooden chest
reinforced with steel plates, stands along one wall. Puffy white cotton cumulus
clouds stand out from the muted blues of the oval rug here. Dark red pillows
contrasting with the inky black velvet, a plush sofa sits here looking rather
comfortable. Crystal beads dangle from the comfortably cushioned hammock
hanging here, the gems sparkling like stars as they catch stray light. A
dubious sculpture of Salish towers here. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. The crumbled leather scroll lies exposed
to the elements. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. His fur a
dusky ash colour, Ashen sits quietly in one corner. Zeldia Melloryn is here,
dancing with dazzling footwork. Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems is
here. He wields a fire opal engagement ring in his left hand and a living vodun
doll of Zeldia in his right. Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux is here.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux chuckles darkly.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "I am not a poor little elf."
-Salish cursing Zeldia a bunch-
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Nooooooooooo."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Your appearance betrays you, then."
Salish ceases to wield a fire opal engagement ring in his left hand.
Salish begins to wield a curved sabre in his left hand.
Zeldia uses her right foot to stomp on her left as hard as possible.
With a lightning-quick motion, Salish slashes Zeldia with a curved sabre.
Salish swings a curved sabre powerfully at Zeldia.
With the heel of her palm, Zeldia smacks herself upside the head.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Goodnight, my poor elf."
Zeldia smiles as she rams her fist into her jaw.
Lyon's forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.
With the heel of her palm, Zeldia smacks herself upside the head.
Zeldia has been slain by Salish.
Zeldia drops some golden sovereigns onto the ground.
Salish gives a horrified gasp.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I did masochism.."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I'm stupid.."
Overcome by death, Zeldia's spirit fades to grey.
"Yep," Lyon says with indifferent finality.
You ask, in Ssylsin, "Did you not intend to kill her?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Nope."
"Heh heh heh," Salish chuckles.
Lyon's forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.
Your features set in a demonic grin of pure malevolence, you cry a gleeful
prayer to the forces of darkness and plunge your hand deep into Zeldia's chest.
You grip the still-warm and faintly beating heart that lies within, and wrench
it free from its nest of arteries and veins. Your arm bathed and dripping with
the lifeblood of your victim, you hold aloft the wretched organ as a testament
to the power of pure evil.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I'll resurrect 'er."
Salish places a doll of Zeldia on the ground and places his hands on it and
closes his eyes in concentration. He slowly backs away from the doll which
begins to writhe and twist on the ground, slowly growing into the unharmed body
of Zeldia.
With a quick prayer, Salish expertly fashions some rope and cloth into the
rough semblance of a humanoid.
-Salish fashioning the rest of the doll-
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You'll be more respectful, now won't
you?"
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Who asked you for your input anyway."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "This is between me and Salish only."
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Salish is our Lord, ruler of the cotorie, and god of
the wytchen!"
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Quiet yourself, tool."
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "I did not say that."
(Wytchen): Maxia says, "Doll."
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "You are all pitiful fools. Refusing to bow down before
the might of the Empire will result in our ultimate destruction. Bow before
Lord Salish, Lord Lyon, and the might of the Empire, or suffer."
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Yea."
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Damn Dias is not about."
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Maxia, your children are not safe, no one is safe. I
am Lord Salish, the destroyer."
You tell Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems, in Ssylsin, "(Wytchen):
Zeldia says, "Damn Dias is not about."."
Salish covers the ears and eyes of a doll of Zeldia.
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "He made me ignore tells."
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "How to i get it back i forgot."
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Ok never mind."
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Dias is a joke, he could not take the mighty Lord
Salish.. All bow before our Lord!"
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "I am weak, and honored to even be in the same room as
our Lord, the destroyer, Lord Salish."
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "War shall consume your pitiful existance. Plague shall
run wild through your family and friends. Your children shall be consumed, your
women shall be raped, and your men hung from their own home. None shall be
safe."
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "This is not true at least the weak part is anyway."
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "This is all a lie don't believe it."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "This festering hole smells of children."
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Thats cause there are some here."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, in Ssylsin, "Find 'em, and
kill them."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I'll do better."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Have you ever tasted children, my
friend?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Sounds delightful,
but I haven't."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Their flesh is just so tender."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Don't mess with Maxia's kids."
Salish grins mischievously.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "She'll be short a child, soon."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "How could you be so cruel."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You brought it upon your own self."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "How did I bring it upon myseld."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You can ponder that as you suffer,
tool."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I'm going to search for my snack."
Lyon leaves to the east.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Can't wait."
Lyon arrives from the east.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "My my, I think I've found one."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Did you find one?"
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Salish rubs his hands together greedily and mutters, "Eeexxcellent..."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Let the kid go."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux sinisterly raises a small Lycaean pup, the hound
wimpering in fear.
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Let him go."
Without hesitation you cram the heart into your mouth and sink your fangs into
the juicy flesh. As the blood bursts out from inside it, you feel your dark
power growing as you absorb the life essence of your victim.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Did I tell you to speak?"
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Sorry Lord."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Do you prefer we kill it here, or
there?"
Lyon snorts arrogantly.
Throwing back her head, Zeldia screams agonizingly.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Where ever."
You see Zeldia Melloryn yell, "No."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Leave the pup alone."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "I can't think of anything more deserving
of this miserable hound then dying infront of those who seek to defend it."
Lyon snorts arrogantly.
Zeldia slaps Lyon on the cheek.
Lyon curls his lip and sneers arrogantly.
Salish ties up a doll of Zeldia with a piece of string.
Zeldia has writhed free of her entanglement by ropes.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux snarls, "Salish, control your pet."
Salish utters a short prayer, and then breaks all four limbs on his doll of
Zeldia.
Zeldia's eyes roll back in her head as all of her limbs are suddenly shattered
in multiple places.
-Insert Salish vodun mangling her here-
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Now, where were we.."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux places the pup upon the ground, staring intently upon the
scampering critter. Howls of agony and terror engulf the surrounding as blood
beings to pour from the tiny creature, its existance drawing to a halting stop.
Zeldia whispers to you, "Can't you do anything here."
Salish puts a doll of Zeldia up to his ear and listens closely.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "I'd prefer a knife, but this will do."
You tell Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux, in Ssylsin, "Now find the others. Kill them
all."
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Calling on your dark power, you draw a thick shroud of concealment about
yourself to cover your every action.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "How many of these vermin are there?"
You shake your head at Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "I would rather not say."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Make her."
You tell Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux, in Ssylsin, "Come down a moment."
Lyon arrives from the up.
You quickly toss a wicked-looking daegger to Lyon, who catches it nimbly.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Thanks man."
You nod your head.
Lyon begins to wield a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand.
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Six in all."
Lyon arrives from the down.
Comprehension flashes across Salish's face.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Six."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "No there isnt."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "My my, look at this one."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "No."
Zeldia whispers to you, "Why not."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "I think it may be an Akrabi."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Don't you just dispise bugs?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Now you know I do."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Its not a bug."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Silence."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "No."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Squash it."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Your correct."
You tell Zeldia Melloryn, "I have no equipment. I cannot fight them."
Zeldia tells you, "They are killing Maxi."
Lyon nods his head.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux places the child upon the ground, next to the already
slain pup, and places his foot upon it. A malign smirk overtakes his features
as he raises the other foot and speedily brings it down upon the skull of the
child, killing it in a mass of blood and brain matter.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Why are you killing her children?"
Zeldia shakes her head.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "They are worthless from their mother and
father. I'm doing the world a favor."
Tears fill Zeldia's eyes and begin to slowly run down her face.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Zeldia, "Yes, cry."
Lyon strokes Zeldia tenderly.
Lyon whispers something to Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Why are you stroking me you don't care about
me."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux chuckles darkly, turning to find more children.
Lyon leaves to the west.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Salish, "Why are you letting him do this."
"Heh heh heh," Salish chuckles.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Why should I stop him?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Why do you think I even
brought him?"
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "Tell me Maxia, do you love your children? Or I guess I
should say, did you love your children? They where very crunchy if you must
know."
Lyon arrives from the west.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux drops two tiny wolf pups upon the ground next to the
other victims, their forms bruised and bound by rope.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "You know what is a custom in Ithaqua?"
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Salish gives Lyon an acknowledging nod.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Salish, "Cannibalism."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "But, I don't like my victims plain."
With a pointed stick, Salish begins sketching a rune on the ground.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Your nasty."
A wall of rough stone rises from the earth to block the exit to the down.
You tell Zeldia Melloryn, "Where iss Maxia? Why iss she not protecting her
children?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I cold get some salt, if
you'd prefer?"
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "For you see, roasting brings out the
flavor."
Zeldia tells you, "I dont know she won't respond to me i tried."
Salish nods his head.
Lyon coughs softly.
Zeldia vomits up the contents of her stomach.
Zeldia pukes all over Lyon.
Lyon slaps Zeldia on the cheek.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Control your stomach, my dear."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You'll be the one presenting my mess."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "I could if you wouldn't do that here."
Lyon rolls his eyes.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Too bad, I'm going to make a display."
Zeldia vomits the contents of her stomach onto Lyon.
Lyon gives a pained sigh.
Lyon stares at Zeldia, giving her the evil eye.
Zeldia's eyes close suddenly as she falls asleep.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Much better."
Zeldia opens her eyes and yawns mightily.
Zeldia spits in Lyon's face.
Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.
-Salish afflicting her some more-
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Ok ok."
With a lightning-quick motion, Salish slashes Zeldia with a curved sabre.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "I'll stop."
Salish nods his head.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux sparks his tinderbox, moving the flickering fire closer
to the bound pups. It ignites their fur, and howls of terror and agony ring
through the halls. As the corpses blacken and char, Lyon casually picks up a
bloated body, and savagely chomps in to the burnt flesh.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Slightly overdone."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "It'll do, never had
mutt before."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Try some."
Lyon takes a drink from a dark black vial with silver stars.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Now, lets see..."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems puts his foot on the body of a
burnt pup's body, and tears off a leg with his hand.
"Ewwwwwwwww!" says Zeldia in disgust.
Lyon cackles hellishly.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "You are all sick in the head."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Savour all the flavour these things
hold."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems examines the the pup leg for a
moment, picks off a patch of fur and takes a bite.
Zeldia tells you, "I think maxia is off in dream world somewhere."
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Leave enough for my corpse pile."
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Salish.
Salish rubs some salve on his skin.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "It will be my crowning achievment."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Did you find them all."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Regardless, that's four so far, right?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says "Not that bad." while chewing
the meat still in his mouth.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Aye."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "That is sickening."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Two more, hmmm..."
Lyon leaves to the north.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "There isnt six."
Lyon arrives from the north.
Lyon viciously smacks Zeldia about the chops.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "I am telling the truth."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Zeldia, "Your a riot, you know that."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "That I am aware of there is not six."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Did you find another."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux snarls, "Don't lie to me, tool."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Just one, another one of those bug children."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "I am not to my knowledge."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems gets on top of Zeldia and forces a
pup leg bone into her mouth.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "Shush."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "How would you feel if that was your kid and an
enemy did that to one of them."
The wall of stone to the down suddenly collapses under its own massive weight.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Who would dare?"
Lyon smirks.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "No me but just saying."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux releases the bound body of an Akrabi upon the floor,
laughing insanely.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Salish, "I love how these squish under
my boot."
You tell Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux, "Pry the chitin off of it with the daegger,
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I think this one should die slowly
though."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Agreed."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Or better, live to suffer the death of
its kin."
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Salish.
Salish rubs some salve on his skin.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems puts a foot lightly on the chest
of the akrabi kid.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I'll hold it here, go find
the other."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "No."
Lyon's forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "The oldest one?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "Aye."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Leave the oldest alone."
Salish gives Zeldia a wry smile, his eyes lighting up deviously.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I'd like to finish my project, first."
Lyon slaps Zeldia on the cheek.
Salish gives Lyon an acknowledging nod.
"Ouch!", Zeldia shrieks in pain.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You've been caught in your own lie,
tool."
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "The flesh of your younglings is very tender, Maxia.
I'm enjoying this."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux bends over, casually wedging his daegger under the chitin
of the child. Slowly, he removes a piece from the neck, which bleeds heavily.
He continues down the neck, until it is bare and raw.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Don't you just dispise chitters?"
"Ewwwwwwwww!" says Zeldia in disgust.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "That stupid sound they make?"
(Wytchen): Maxia says, "16."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Aye."
(Wytchen): Zeldia says, "16 what."
Lyon smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
It is the 5th day of Vita, in the year 569 AD.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux savagely jabs two fingers in to the neck of the child,
twisting its vocal cords before removing a bloodied hand. Laughing darkly, he
slices the mandibles from the child, leaving it gurgling in pain.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "This one will bleed to death."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "How mean."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux violently kicks the body towards the pile, its limp body
flailing randomly.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "One more, one more."
Lyon rubs his hands together greedily and mutters, "Eeexxcellent..."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "I hope when you have children they die in the
same way."
Lyon slaps Zeldia on the cheek.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "Enjoy that I haven't slain you yet,
fool."
(Wytchen): Maxia says, "And they will remain safe."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "I am not a fool."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "And, on top of that, I treat you to a
glorious spectacle? You ungrateful gnat."
Salish takes up a living vodun doll of Zeldia in his left hand.
Salish begins to wield a curved sabre in his right hand.
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn slams her face into a near puddle of pup blood.
Zeldia vomits the contents of her stomach onto Salish.
Lyon whispers something to Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Sorry."
Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.
Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.
Salish takes a drink from a golden tree vial.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "One more, one more."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "No."
Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Quite problematic, isn't it?"
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Should it live? Should it die?"
You say to Lyon, in Ssylsin, "All life dies, aye?"
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "You should be the one to die."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "As it should."
Lyon's forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Is it right for me to judge over this creatures life?"
You say, "The sstrong have alwayss ssubjugated the weak.."
Zeldia blushes as she hides her face in her hands in embarrassment.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "I suppose I have my answer then."
Zeldia wrinkles her nose and sniffs.
Lyon leaves to the up.
Lyon arrives from the up.
Zeldia whispers something to Salish.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "You took
advantage of my love, and now it's turned, and soured."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Salish, "How did I take advantage of it."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux returns with the bruised and bloodied body of a large
Lycaen held over his shoulder, the dog howling and screaming in pain and
suffering. He drops it upon the ground, then smirks silently.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "Enough, watch the
show."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "This one put up a bit of a fight."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Well duh she is over 18."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "It's part of the
wytchen, couldn't have been that much of one."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "And capable of putting up a fight."
Lyon smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Lyon looks sternly at Zeldia and shushes her.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "This is making me sik to my stomach."
Zeldia Melloryn exclaims to Lyon, "NO!!"
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Well you see, when I was a child, I was
part of an experiment."
Lyon fidgets impatiently.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "They poked me, they prodded me."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "That doesn't suprise me."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says to Salish, "They even went as far to take
my eyes out."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "They must have screwed up your brain somewhere."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "I think they took the brain as well and forgot to put
one in."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I was young, and foolish."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "And you still are foolish."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I fought what they had gifted me with."
Lyon fidgets impatiently.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "You see, the eyes are very powerful."
Salish tilts his head and listens intently to Lyon.
Zeldia Melloryn says, "Gifted."
Zeldia says, "Psh!" derisively as she waves her hand dismissing the idea.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "They can channel a very powerful magick,
or betray your true feelings."
Zeldia Melloryn says, "This is a bunch of hogwash."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "I'm not giving this child that chance."
Lyon fidgets impatiently.
Throwing back her head, Zeldia screams agonizingly.
Salish whispers something to a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia tilts her head and listens intently to Lyon.
Throwing back her head, Zeldia screams agonizingly.
Salish points an imperious finger at Zeldia.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux narrates to Salish as he steps toward the panting body,
raising his blade to commit his next act. "You see, eyes can be easily
removed...", he says as he prods the right eye of the child, which promptly
releases of its socket. "With a little pressure, you see...", he mumbles as he
stabs the left eye, removing it cleanly.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "You can pull them out nice and easy."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux bends over again, severing the cords which connect the
eyes. He picks them up, then hands them to Zeldia.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Zeldia, "You have something to show their mother
now."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "And finally.."
Zeldia Melloryn drops both eyeballs on the floor in disust.
You have emoted: Airen coils his tail around the eyeballs, keeping them from
being smashed and shakes his head.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux severs the bloodied face of the Lycaean viciously with
his hands, the spine snapping as he twists the head off in a bloody mess.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "And now, we're done."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "You are a real sicko."
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Not to mention a real jerk."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux casually kicks the corpse to the body pile, blood and
gore colouring the floor.
Lyon rolls his eyes at Zeldia.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Just like your brother."
Lyon gives a snake-like hiss.
Salish smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Lyon, "Oh did I hit a sensitive spot."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "Talking about
brothers are we?"
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "This worm deserves treatment."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "May I?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Zeldia, "It was your
brother who first allowed me into this guildhall."
Your daegger comes racing towards you, stopping unnaturally quickly to land in
your grasp.
Salish shrugs helplessly at Lyon.
Zeldia Melloryn says to Salish, "And your point being."
Salish gives Zeldia a wry smile, his eyes lighting up deviously.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "The only cure for such ignorance and
blatant disrespect is death."
Salish utters a curse at a Vodun doll of Zeldia.
Zeldia seems to be moving in slow motion suddenly.
Salish nods his head at Lyon, showing his acceptance.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to Salish, "Allow me."
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I'm done with 'er."
Salish urges Lyon onwards.
Lyon stares at Zeldia, giving her the evil eye.
Blood begins to slowly drip from Zeldia's nose.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles impishly and says, "The plague is a nifty
affliction."
Zeldia coughs suddenly, expelling black fluid with bits of what looks to be
tissue suspended in it.
Zeldia trembles slightly as a yellow jaundice begins to creep through her
now-pale features.
You watch in horror as blood begins to seep from every pore in Zeldia's body.
Zeldia begins to convulse, and as her mouth opens in a silent scream, you hear
a loud snapping as her back shatters from the sheer force of the spasms.
Zeldia has been slain by Lyon.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Much better."
Lyon picks up the corpse of Zeldia.
Overcome by death, Zeldia's spirit fades to grey.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Thank you for your assistance."
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to Lyon, "Drop the corpse."
You nod your head.
Lyon drops the corpse of Zeldia.
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "I'll decapitate it for
you."
Lyon claps his hands together merrily.
Salish begins chopping away at the neck of the corpse of Zeldia with a curved
sabre.
Salish finishes decapitating the corpse of Zeldia, leaving only a pool of blood
where the head had been.
Lyon picks up the decapitated head of Zeldia.
Lyon pets the decapitated head of Zeldia ingratiatingly.
You flick your forked tongue out briefly, testing the air.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux smiles and says, "Now I have a momemento for all the fun
we had today."
You say, in Ssylsin, "As do I, it seems."
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says to you, "Do enjoy those."
You have emoted: Airen kneels and picks up the eyes, tucking them away in his
robes.
Salish bows respectfully to Lyon.
Acolyte Lyon Zaridiux says, "Time to leave?"
Lord Salish Scrae'Uden, Subjugator of Totems says to you, "Would you mind
letting him out?"
You beckon to Lyon.
Lyon begins to follow you.
"Farewell," Salish says, raising a hand fondly.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+4 points with 4 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08ba76d9cf1df5e428da9d8e45de8bea?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by benign_butterfly@xxx on 05 Jan 2009</p>Firstly.
