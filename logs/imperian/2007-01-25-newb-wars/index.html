Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. You stand amid a tight
cluster of aged sycamore trees whose trunks have thrust into the sky for many a
year, and whose branches are now spread wide to catch the rays of the sun. 
Occasionally from the heights a seed pod spirals dizzily towards the ground 
alighting at you feet, drawing your attention to the numerous armoured beetles 
which roam like tiny tanks through the debris of the littered forest floor. A 
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. The decaying 
remains of Senshi lie here.

Sycamore Coppice. (lost) (Western Celidon.?)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. You stand amid a tight
cluster of aged sycamore trees whose trunks have thrust into the sky for many a
year, and whose branches are now spread wide to catch the rays of the sun.
Occasionally from the heights a seed pod spirals dizzily towards the ground
alighting at you feet, drawing your attention to the numerous armoured beetles
which roam like tiny tanks through the debris of the littered forest floor. A
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. The decaying
remains of Senshi lie here.
You see exits leading north and east.
[Match probability: 100%]
