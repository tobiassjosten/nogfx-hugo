Forge of the Lion. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A large hammock threaded together with 
silver rope and adorned with silver dove trinkets swings in the breeze here. 
Marked with distinguishing white and black fur, a large panda bear is here 
munching lazily on a bamboo stalk. A massive groomed black stallion stands here
proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. Its beady eyes 
searching for some new prey, a lithe black fox slinks around the area. A silk 
pack lies on the ground. Erus Notine Scrae'Uden, Occisor Prodigii is here. He 
wields a shining longsword in his left hand. You see a sign here instructing 
you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading south and northwest (closed door).

Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, you bring your battleaxe crashing 
straight down on Notine's head. With a power that seems to come from on high, 
you cleave asunder his entire body, from head to groin, splitting him in two 
and killing him instantly.
You have slain Notine.
