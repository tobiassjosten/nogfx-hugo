There are 2 beehives here. A flame-charred chariot pulled by demonic goats

confidence and aloofness. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces 
here, padding softly back and forth. Rais Ruquba Ander is here. He wields an 
ivory sitara in his right hand.
You see a single exit leading down.
You cease the whirling of your weapon over your head.
