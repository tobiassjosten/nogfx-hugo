Talash's attention is grabbed and held by a nairat rune.
Talash's limbs lock up as his eyes meet an inguz rune on a totem.

Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, you bring your broadsword crashing 
straight down on Talash's head. With a power that seems to come from on high, 
you cleave asunder his entire body, from head to groin, splitting him in two 
and killing him instantly.
You have slain Talash. (Damage: 0)
Defeated, Talash is cast out of the Arena.
