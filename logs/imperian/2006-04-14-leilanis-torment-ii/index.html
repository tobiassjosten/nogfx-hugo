Mathardan, the Loresage frowns slightly as he finds a book out of place, and
pops it back in.

You crease your brow in a frown.

A quiet alcove. (ruins of Caanae.)

You see a single exit leading north.
You reach over and give a candelabra a firm pull, and it tilts forward slightly
with a creak. A loud screeching noise echoes about the room, and a large slab
of the marble floor slides away in a cloud of dust, revealing steps leading
down.
Decaying hidden archives. (lost)
You see a single exit leading up.

A candelabra next to you raises slightly, creaking as it does, and the exit
leading upwards is sealed

You give a pained sigh.

You take a seat on a comfortable rope hammock.

Sethren ripples into existence before you.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hello."

You blink.

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

You angrily say, "... It probably wouldn&#39;t help if I asked you to leave, would
it."

You stand up from a comfortable rope hammock.

Sethren Argyle says, "No."

Sethren Argyle says, "Did you think you could hide?"

Sethren gazes intently at you, his forked tongue flickering inquisitively.

Leilani sighs unhappily, her hands nervously smoothing down the material of
her skirt. "That was the general idea," she whispers softly.

Sethren Argyle wraps his tail lightly around you, pulling you up close to him
but not restraining much.

Sethren Argyle says, "I suppose I don&#39;t blame you too much. Hm..not yet,
anyway."

Leilani stiffens the instant she feels your tail against her, she steps
back quickly, moving out of your reach, hissing angrily at you.

You angrily say, "Why can&#39;t you leave me be!"

Sethren Argyle says, "Because..you&#39;re mine. It&#39;s my right to do as I will with
you."

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "What do you think continuing to fight it will
accomplish?"

Leilani flashes a smoldering glare at you, her fists balling up in rage,
but she stays silent.

Sethren Argyle moves closer to you and takes hold of both of your shoulders. In
one smooth motion he shoves you down to your knees in front of him, not being
at all gentle. "There..that&#39;s better.".

Leilani yelps in surprise as she is shoved roughly to her knees, her face
flushing a bright red. Immediately she moves to stand, even more outraged
than she was a moment before, nearly panting in her fury.

Sethren Argyle keeps his hands at your shoulders, and coils his tail tightly
around your waist, holding you where you are. "Mm..stop that.".

Leilani glowers up at you. Without warning she raises her arm,
gripping her dagger in a white-knuckled hand, she lashes out at your
midsection, attempting to throw herself to the side at the same moment.

Sethren Argyle quickly catches that wrist in one hand, gripping it hard enough
to bruise. With the other hand he harshly backhands you across the face, enough
to knock you down if you weren&#39;t restrained. He hisses, anger evident in his
eyes for the first time, "I TOLD you to stop that."

Leilani blinks back tears as the impact of the slap sends a burst of white hot
pain through her. The knife clatters loudly to the ground as her fingers stop
obeying her command to hold it. She kneels before you, stunned to silence,
trembling like a frightened rabbit.

You drop a long, sharp dagger.

Sethren Argyle bends down just enough to pick up the dagger, still holding you
down securely. He glares at you, "I see that you aren&#39;t learning as quickly as
I thought. You were hoping to hurt me, weren&#39;t you? That was a very..foolish
thing to do." He takes your other wrist in his hand, tightening his hold on
both, as he&#39;s obviously still angry.

Leilani pales visibly, her trembling only increasing as fear slowly replaces
the rage in her eyes. She simply stares at the ground in front of her knees,
silent tears streaming down her face.

Sethren Argyle coils his tail a little tighter yet, it becoming quite
uncomfortable now. "So..what do you say? Do I have to hurt you more? I quite
enjoy it, I think..so it doesn&#39;t matter to me." He smirks, "And I&#39;ll take
silence as a yes."

Leilani whimpers, trying in vain to pull her wrists out of your grasp,
"Please... please don&#39;t hurt me anymore" she pleads, finally looking up
to catch your gaze.

Sethren Argyle nods slowly, releasing your wrists and watching you closely for
any attempt to escape. "I&#39;m glad you saw the smart thing to do. Perhaps it cana
be easier now?" He smiles and strokes your hair lightly, his anger fading
somewhat.

Leilani frowns slightly, her gaze directed once more to the floor. Confusion is
etched on her face at your sudden change of temperament. "What... what do you
want from me, now?" she whispers quietly.

Sethren Argyle says, "I simply wish for your obedience. This will be much
easier for you if you simply..accept it."

Leilani shakes her head, "How can you expect me to accept obedience? You have
kidnapped me, you have hurt me, why would I harbor anything but hatred for you?"
she growls, rubbing her wrist gingerly.

Sethren Argyle crouches down next to you, stroking your reddened cheek lightly.
"Because I am your Master..and that isn&#39;t going to change. Fighting it is
useless. You will learn that in time." He eyes the collar around your neck,
"Hm..will have to get you a new one, that one seems flimsy."

Leilani blushes brightly, her hand moving instantly to the collar around her
neck as she turns her head away from your unexpectedly tender caress.

Sethren Argyle ponders for a moment, quickly unclasping the collar and removing
it. "You will have a replacement soon. You don&#39;t need to be wearing one that
doesn&#39;t remind you of me." He grins slightly, putting the collar away in his
satchel.

Leilani whimpers as her hand moves over the suddenly bare flesh around her neck,
a deep frown etched on her face, "That... was a gift from my mentor..." she trails
off, her shoulders slumping dejectedly.

Sethren whispers to you, "Then perhaps eventually I will reward you with its
return."

Sethren Argyle says, "Now, I need to be leaving for a bit, I&#39;m afraid."

Sethren Argyle says, "If you&#39;re here when I return, I expect you to come to me
without me asking. Or I&#39;ll have to hurt you further."

Sethren swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

You whimper like a wounded puppy.

You frown and say, "...I&#39;ll come."

Sethren Argyle says, "You may do as you wish until then."

Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.

You give a snake-like hiss.'>Leilani idly looks through the books on the shelf, occasionally taking one off
