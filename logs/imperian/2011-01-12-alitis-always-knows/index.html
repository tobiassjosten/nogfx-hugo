A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. This has been marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. An armoured knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel before a fierce lion. The shop directory of Antioch rests here on a marble pedestal. Entrancingly placed in the room, someone has put a bread loaf shaped candle here. An intricately carved muamrite guard&#39;s spear lies abandoned here. An elite Antioch cleric is manning a cannon here. She has 100 cannon balls. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. There are 3 armoured battle stallions here. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to the ground. Its head poised in a prideful stance, a sleek black stallion stands here snorting arrogantly. A black wolf stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey. A shaggy grey mustang roams warily nearby. There are 12 elite Antioch clerics here. There are 11 elite Justicars of the Shah here. Strong of stature, a strapping buckskin mare stands here. The body of a dead baby rat lies here. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Standing placidly here, a tri-colored paint mare noses about, her tail swatting absentmindedly behind her. A Seraphic guardian stands menacingly nearby, with flashing eyes and majestic flame-wreathed wings. Balanced easily on its oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with its huge, blue eyes. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Huge eyes blinking sleepily at you, a snowy owl roosts here. Massive and immovable as an iceberg, a tundra bear stands proudly here. A muscular vorep prowls around here. Sniffing at the wind curiously, a small white fox pauses here. A small reef heron stands here, ruffling its feathers ever so slightly. Fluttering about and calling raucously, an arctic tern hovers in the air here. A large buff-coloured sea lion swaggers about here. A young rat cautiously noses about for food here. A baby rat timidly moves in the shadows here. Canasius is lying on the ground. Grandmistress Broll Eldunari, Gentle Giant of Manoa is here, sprawled on the ground. Inquisitor Lyon Zaridiux is here. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand. Zerin Arkadis, the Inferno is riding on a large red kangaroo named Warroo. She wields a mace wreathed in holy flames in her left hand. Alitis, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the surroundings with a miasma of fear. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, and northwest.
