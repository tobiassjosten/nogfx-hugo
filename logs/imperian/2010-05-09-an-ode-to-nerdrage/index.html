You enter a sonic portal. (portal)
Khizan follows you to the ether.
Dirt road north of a forest. (road). (Vardarian Highlands.?)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A large chunk of a metallic rock is lying on the ground. A sonic portal, edges vibrating madly, is here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Maglust, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a bladed whip in his left hand. Lillabee Aslyana is here, shrouded. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a sturdy shortsword in her right. The undead form of Lord Menoch Andarial, Animus Volatilis is here. He is holding a tower shield in his right hand. The undead form of Lord Alitis Valstivar, Harbinger of Catastrophe is here. Lord Oburi Nessaja, Will of Vis'Ahl is riding on a tranquil white mare. Jasmina Askare is here.
You see exits leading east, southwest, and west.

Faster than the eye can follow, Menoch's Ouroboros's blood-red hands shoot out and burrow into the chest of Dias, whose body begins bucking and convulsing from the pain. Peeling back its lips to reveal its maw, the Ouroboros roars in triumph and rips its powerful arms backwards, dragging an ephemeral, spiderweb substance with it: Dias's soul.
A worm loses its grip on Dias and drops to the ground.
A green slime loses its grip on Dias and drops to the ground.
The bloodleech loses its grip on Dias and drops to the ground.
A stream of primal darkness flows out from Dias.
Dias has been slain by Menoch.
You gasp with the realization that Menoch has reached the pk level of Paramortal.

Exposed rock. (Demon's Pass.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A fairly large pile of golden sovereigns twinkles and gleams. There are 2 corpses of a tall, sneering demon here. Skin flayed and crisped by fire, a demon lies here with a snarl twisting his dead features. A runed femur lying next to his deformed leg, a dead demon is here. A lame demon stands here leaning heavily on the long femur that serves him as a cane. A demon with a green face stands here, staring at the nearby demons with an envious expression. Veiled in thin, translucent cloth, a demonic temptress stands here with a sensual expression.
You see exits leading north and southeast.

He is a fast Sylayan. He is of an unusual appearance to those of his race. This elf stands at a tall height of six feet and one inch. The first thing that catches the eye is his long crimson hair, streaked with black wisp throughout it. Although his hair is long, it's surrounded in a flexible white clasp that drapes all the way down to his hips. His bangs fall upon his face, draping angularly across as to not block his eyes. His face although being flawless holds a very angular look. His ears add to the angularity of his elfen heritage by strike out of his hair, pointed tips at the top of each. His cheek bones rise high into his bone structure while his nose is bridged evenly within his face and with a smooth ending. His eyes seem to be liquid amethyst through his silver glasses, capturing you within their steady gaze. His eyes are equally placed upon his face and angular to his bone structure, giving him a almost feral appearance. His skin is a seemingly soft white alabaster. However, a large marring on his body can be seen upon his chest through the opening of his clothes. A large scar ravages from the left of his shoulder down to his top right rib. His torso is complimented with a muscular chest and abdomen, visible slightly through his tunic. His body although mostly thin is not without muscle. His lithe muscles place along his body giving more of an intimidating figure, yet his pearly smile seems to give a reassurance to others of safety. He is wearing a black forearm sheath, a soft, faded gray game kitbag, a modest pouch of black leather, a white feathered armband, a black leather falconry glove, a cavalry shield, a banded shield, a golden silk pack, a suit of wyvernhide armour, a modest black leather satchel, a money pouch, a white hooded cloak, a silver engagement ring, a pair of Orphanim Angel wings, a silver ring of meditation, a Girdle of Aesir, a shining metal surcoat of Cruxis, a set of diamond bracelets, a glittering ring of vitality, and a small charm. He wields Insidian's Bane in his left hand and a curved sabre in his right. He is surrounded by the fluctuating aura of the Boon of Change.

Serge335544 (8:44:32 PM): WHen you get a stressful life that sucks for two random fucking weeks and want to relax, you'll understand

fiery invective (9:16:50 PM): i was afk and you ran into siege
fiery invective (9:16:57 PM): i'm curious to see how you'll blame this one on me

Serge335544 (9:17:58 PM): You know, in the Army, we'd call some one like you a Blue Falcon
Serge335544 (9:18:09 PM): Or in other terms, a shit bag
fiery invective (9:18:30 PM): good thing i'm not in the army then
Serge335544 (9:18:59 PM): Man, I can't believe I attempted to see some type of good in you.
Serge335544 (9:19:12 PM): You wonder why you are in the situation that you are in the real world. 
Serge335544 (9:19:16 PM): It's a thing called Karma.
fiery invective (9:19:22 PM): oh no, i don't wonder at all
fiery invective (9:19:39 PM): though i do find it amusing that you're getting so worked up over a game
Serge335544 (9:19:45 PM): Here is a hint, being a douchebag will worsen the situation
fiery invective (9:19:47 PM): but, well, that was predictable
Serge335544 (9:20:02 PM): No, I am getting worked up that you are now telling people, especially ones that I dislike my business
Serge335544 (9:20:26 PM): Let me go tell everyone in Imperian that you live with your parents on a couch or some shit from your life
Serge335544 (9:20:37 PM): Yeah, I know, you don't care.
fiery invective (9:20:43 PM): pretty much
fiery invective (9:20:45 PM): why do you care?
Serge335544 (9:20:45 PM): So save your retort
Serge335544 (9:20:51 PM): because it is MY business
Serge335544 (9:21:04 PM): I don't want retards like Apoloc knowing what I do
fiery invective (9:21:07 PM): business that you've already unnecessarily shared because you are mad over a text game on the internet
fiery invective (9:21:26 PM): you had no reason to mention it in the first place, and this is a great example of why doing that sort of thing only amps into more ridicule
fiery invective (9:21:36 PM): it's why i told you 'don't play that card'
Serge335544 (9:21:51 PM): So you go tell on one of the retarded ooc clans my fucking businesS?
Serge335544 (9:21:56 PM): That's mature of you, really is.
fiery invective (9:22:03 PM): ring, actually, because it was hilarious and you're getting absurdly worked up over it
Serge335544 (9:22:17 PM): I'm getting worked up because you intentionally do shit to piss me off.
Serge335544 (9:24:18 PM): And the worse part of it is that I considered you a decent person and some one who was worth establishing some sort of friendship with. 
Serge335544 (9:24:22 PM): That's the worst part of the whole thing.
fiery invective (9:25:38 PM): nothing about how i acted today is new to you at all
fiery invective (9:25:48 PM): at least it shouldn't be
Serge335544 (9:25:54 PM): Yeah, it is really. I expect you to play Ashel as a douchebag, not yourself
Serge335544 (9:26:00 PM): I was evidently wrong in thinking that accord though
fiery invective (9:26:11 PM): i dunno, you were on the forums
Serge335544 (9:26:28 PM): Thinking that some how, you weren't a shitbag that people told me you were. Trying to see the good in people is something I give everyone
fiery invective (9:26:29 PM): it's not like i'm here giving away everyone's secrets but, well
fiery invective (9:26:39 PM): you're getting insanely worked up over a game and trolls fire on all engines
fiery invective (9:26:52 PM): i find that mildly amusing given how many people did and do say that about you
Serge335544 (9:27:01 PM): Has nothing to do with the game, its the principles of what you did that took place here and in the game
fiery invective (9:27:06 PM): i killed you
fiery invective (9:27:07 PM): twice
fiery invective (9:27:09 PM): you flipped your shit
fiery invective (9:27:12 PM): i shared it, because it was funny
fiery invective (9:27:24 PM): it's a fairly simple logical progression
Serge335544 (9:27:27 PM): I said good job on the giant teaming, I didn't really care. Death moves like .05% of my EXP
Serge335544 (9:27:43 PM): The second one you did because you think you can do anything and get away with it type of shit
Serge335544 (9:27:46 PM): That's why it pissed me off
fiery invective (9:27:58 PM): anything? hardly
Serge335544 (9:27:59 PM): Then you further went to be a jackass and spluge shit to people I have a particular distaste for
fiery invective (9:28:05 PM): that? yes, yes i knew i could get away with that
Serge335544 (9:28:39 PM): So, I applaud your douchebaggery. Good job.
fiery invective (9:28:57 PM): thank you, thank you, i'll be here all week
Serge335544 (9:29:28 PM): I'm sure you will. Just know, it's people like you that cause some one who has a stressful life to do idiotic things because they don't get that time to be able to work down their system after some thing traumatic.
Serge335544 (9:30:25 PM): Like, oh... Say having to grab your fellow soldiers two feet that just got blown off by an IED while putting a tourniquet on his thighs to stop arterial and veinous bleedinlg while you tell him, &#34;Don't worry, you're going to make it thoruhg&#34; knowing that the shrapnel in his heart is causing him to bleed out.
Serge335544 (9:30:41 PM): God forbid that person try and wind down
Serge335544 (9:30:43 PM): Right?
Serge335544 (9:30:47 PM): Yeah, I guess that's right
fiery invective (9:30:48 PM): that
fiery invective (9:30:52 PM): was the worst analogy i've ever heard
fiery invective (9:30:54 PM): and you should feel ashamed
Serge335544 (9:31:08 PM): Analogy? That's what happend on Thursday.
Serge335544 (9:31:18 PM): But whatever
Serge335544 (9:31:20 PM): Go tell that to your buddies
fiery invective (9:31:22 PM): no, analogy, because you're comparing it to YOU DYING ON THE INTERNET
Serge335544 (9:31:25 PM): I'm sure I'll hear about it in the morning
fiery invective (9:31:28 PM): probably
Serge335544 (9:31:39 PM): I don't think I compared to that game at all
Serge335544 (9:32:26 PM): I believed I compared your douchbaggery of a person causing people who do activies that release stress from them causing them to be more stressed and thus, do stupid things
Serge335544 (9:32:31 PM): Was a general expression
fiery invective (9:32:46 PM): and then you tried to compare it to.. honestly
fiery invective (9:32:49 PM): why am i even trying to reason here
fiery invective (9:33:06 PM): when you're back in reality you know where to find me, i'm too lazy to hold grudges
Serge335544 (9:33:11 PM): I compared it to my stress, first hand example.
Serge335544 (9:34:00 PM): Whatever, this just gives me an extra hour to write the letter to his wife and child.
Serge335544 (9:34:12 PM): Maybe think about your actions for once and if they were wrong, then you'll see what I am talking about

A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A fairly large pile of golden sovereigns twinkles and gleams. There are 2 corpses of a tall, sneering demon here. Skin flayed and crisped by fire, a demon lies here with a snarl twisting his dead features. A runed femur lying next to his deformed leg, a dead demon is here. A lame demon stands here leaning heavily on the long femur that serves him as a cane. A demon with a green face stands here, staring at the nearby demons with an envious expression. Veiled in thin, translucent cloth, a demonic temptress stands here with a sensual expression.

He is a fast Sylayan. He is of an unusual appearance to those of his race. This elf stands at a tall height of six feet and one inch. The first thing that catches the eye is his long crimson hair, streaked with black wisp throughout it. Although his hair is long, it's surrounded in a flexible white clasp that drapes all the way down to his hips. His bangs fall upon his face, draping angularly across as to not block his eyes. His face although being flawless holds a very angular look. His ears add to the angularity of his elfen heritage by strike out of his hair, pointed tips at the top of each. His cheek bones rise high into his bone structure while his nose is bridged evenly within his face and with a smooth ending. His eyes seem to be liquid amethyst through his silver glasses, capturing you within their steady gaze. His eyes are equally placed upon his face and angular to his bone structure, giving him a almost feral appearance. His skin is a seemingly soft white alabaster. However, a large marring on his body can be seen upon his chest through the opening of his clothes. A large scar ravages from the left of his shoulder down to his top right rib. His torso is complimented with a muscular chest and abdomen, visible slightly through his tunic. His body although mostly thin is not without muscle. His lithe muscles place along his body giving more of an intimidating figure, yet his pearly smile seems to give a reassurance to others of safety. He is wearing a black forearm sheath, a soft, faded gray game kitbag, a modest pouch of black leather, a white feathered armband, a black leather falconry glove, a cavalry shield, a banded shield, a golden silk pack, a suit of wyvernhide armour, a modest black leather satchel, a money pouch, a white hooded cloak, a silver engagement ring, a pair of Orphanim Angel wings, a silver ring of meditation, a Girdle of Aesir, a shining metal surcoat of Cruxis, a set of diamond bracelets, a glittering ring of vitality, and a small charm. He wields Insidian's Bane in his left hand and a curved sabre in his right. He is surrounded by the fluctuating aura of the Boon of Change.

Serge335544 (8:39:52 PM): I mean, it's not like I am a human being
fiery invective (8:39:57 PM): don't pull that card
Serge335544 (8:40:02 PM): No, I pulled that card.
Serge335544 (8:40:07 PM): It's because of shit like this that I get pissed.
fiery invective (8:40:10 PM): that's pathetic
Serge335544 (8:40:15 PM): No, it's factual
fiery invective (8:40:27 PM): you know this is a game predicated around someone's gain and someone's loss, risk vs reward and shit
fiery invective (8:40:31 PM): that's why a lot of people play it in the FIRST place
Serge335544 (8:40:33 PM): I'm sitting there, hunting, minding my own business. As general, I am bullshitting with you on AIM then you come team me on the fucking game
Serge335544 (8:40:48 PM): Because of some thing said on AIM that was not even CONFIRMED
fiery invective (8:40:54 PM): i didn't have to confirm it
fiery invective (8:40:57 PM): i already had reasons to kill you
fiery invective (8:41:01 PM): shit
Serge335544 (8:41:02 PM): No, you really didn't.
fiery invective (8:41:03 PM): i didn't even kill you
Serge335544 (8:41:14 PM): Dias and Sanai have never met
fiery invective (8:41:15 PM): 2010-05-08 20:07 - Ristani was slain by Dias.
Serge335544 (8:41:15 PM): not once
Serge335544 (8:41:21 PM): Ristani is not you
Serge335544 (8:41:29 PM): I was also teamed for that earlier, you were there during it
fiery invective (8:41:30 PM): i don't need to meet you to kill you for killing a friend and my guild secretary :V
fiery invective (8:41:32 PM): yeah
fiery invective (8:41:33 PM): but
fiery invective (8:41:36 PM): how many times have i killed you?
fiery invective (8:41:41 PM): 2010-05-09 03:36 - Dias was slain by a demonic temptress.
2010-05-09 03:06 - Dias was slain by Menoch.
2010-05-08 20:56 - Dias was slain by Joran.
fiery invective (8:41:43 PM): (the answer is 0)
Serge335544 (8:41:46 PM): In reality, you pulled a douche move because you that it was cool
fiery invective (8:41:56 PM): actually i thought that it was funny
fiery invective (8:41:57 PM): which it was
Serge335544 (8:42:03 PM): No, it really isn't funny.
fiery invective (8:42:14 PM): most people don't take the game lightly enough to laugh when they die
Serge335544 (8:42:17 PM): But thanks for ruining my night when I was finally being able to settle down and relax.
fiery invective (8:42:18 PM): you should though, it's a lot more fun that way
Serge335544 (8:44:32 PM): WHen you get a stressful life that sucks for two random fucking weeks and want to relax, you'll understand

Serge335544 (9:16:24 PM): Wow
Serge335544 (9:16:29 PM): You truly are a prick, arnt you
fiery invective (9:16:50 PM): i was afk and you ran into siege
fiery invective (9:16:57 PM): i'm curious to see how you'll blame this one on me
Serge335544 (9:17:00 PM): That's not what I am talking about
Serge335544 (9:17:28 PM):
(La): Apoloc says, "Dang Dias."
&lt;0/490h 490/490m>
(La): Apoloc says, "Man just cant relax huh."
Serge335544 (9:17:34 PM): La): Apoloc says, "Log on for some fun and get the shit teamed out of you."
Serge335544 (9:17:58 PM): You know, in the Army, we'd call some one like you a Blue Falcon
Serge335544 (9:18:09 PM): Or in other terms, a shit bag
fiery invective (9:18:30 PM): good thing i'm not in the army then
Serge335544 (9:18:59 PM): Man, I can't believe I attempted to see some type of good in you.
Serge335544 (9:19:12 PM): You wonder why you are in the situation that you are in the real world.
Serge335544 (9:19:16 PM): It's a thing called Karma.
fiery invective (9:19:22 PM): oh no, i don't wonder at all
fiery invective (9:19:39 PM): though i do find it amusing that you're getting so worked up over a game
Serge335544 (9:19:45 PM): Here is a hint, being a douchebag will worsen the situation
fiery invective (9:19:47 PM): but, well, that was predictable
Serge335544 (9:20:02 PM): No, I am getting worked up that you are now telling people, especially ones that I dislike my business
Serge335544 (9:20:26 PM): Let me go tell everyone in Imperian that you live with your parents on a couch or some shit from your life
Serge335544 (9:20:37 PM): Yeah, I know, you don't care.
fiery invective (9:20:43 PM): pretty much
fiery invective (9:20:45 PM): why do you care?
Serge335544 (9:20:45 PM): So save your retort
Serge335544 (9:20:51 PM): because it is MY business
Serge335544 (9:21:04 PM): I don't want retards like Apoloc knowing what I do
fiery invective (9:21:07 PM): business that you've already unnecessarily shared because you are mad over a text game on the internet
fiery invective (9:21:26 PM): you had no reason to mention it in the first place, and this is a great example of why doing that sort of thing only amps into more ridicule
fiery invective (9:21:36 PM): it's why i told you 'don't play that card'
Serge335544 (9:21:51 PM): So you go tell on one of the retarded ooc clans my fucking businesS?
Serge335544 (9:21:56 PM): That's mature of you, really is.
fiery invective (9:22:03 PM): ring, actually, because it was hilarious and you're getting absurdly worked up over it
Serge335544 (9:22:17 PM): I'm getting worked up because you intentionally do shit to piss me off.
Serge335544 (9:24:18 PM): And the worse part of it is that I considered you a decent person and some one who was worth establishing some sort of friendship with.
Serge335544 (9:24:22 PM): That's the worst part of the whole thing.
fiery invective (9:25:38 PM): nothing about how i acted today is new to you at all
fiery invective (9:25:48 PM): at least it shouldn't be
Serge335544 (9:25:54 PM): Yeah, it is really. I expect you to play Ashel as a douchebag, not yourself
Serge335544 (9:26:00 PM): I was evidently wrong in thinking that accord though
fiery invective (9:26:11 PM): i dunno, you were on the forums
Serge335544 (9:26:28 PM): Thinking that some how, you weren't a shitbag that people told me you were. Trying to see the good in people is something I give everyone
fiery invective (9:26:29 PM): it's not like i'm here giving away everyone's secrets but, well
fiery invective (9:26:39 PM): you're getting insanely worked up over a game and trolls fire on all engines
fiery invective (9:26:52 PM): i find that mildly amusing given how many people did and do say that about you
Serge335544 (9:27:01 PM): Has nothing to do with the game, its the principles of what you did that took place here and in the game
fiery invective (9:27:06 PM): i killed you
fiery invective (9:27:07 PM): twice
fiery invective (9:27:09 PM): you flipped your shit
fiery invective (9:27:12 PM): i shared it, because it was funny
fiery invective (9:27:24 PM): it's a fairly simple logical progression
Serge335544 (9:27:27 PM): I said good job on the giant teaming, I didn't really care. Death moves like .05% of my EXP
Serge335544 (9:27:43 PM): The second one you did because you think you can do anything and get away with it type of shit
Serge335544 (9:27:46 PM): That's why it pissed me off
fiery invective (9:27:58 PM): anything? hardly
Serge335544 (9:27:59 PM): Then you further went to be a jackass and spluge shit to people I have a particular distaste for
fiery invective (9:28:05 PM): that? yes, yes i knew i could get away with that
Serge335544 (9:28:39 PM): So, I applaud your douchebaggery. Good job.
fiery invective (9:28:57 PM): thank you, thank you, i'll be here all week
Serge335544 (9:29:28 PM): I'm sure you will. Just know, it's people like you that cause some one who has a stressful life to do idiotic things because they don't get that time to be able to work down their system after some thing traumatic.
Serge335544 (9:30:25 PM): Like, oh... Say having to grab your fellow soldiers two feet that just got blown off by an IED while putting a tourniquet on his thighs to stop arterial and veinous bleedinlg while you tell him, "Don't worry, you're going to make it thoruhg" knowing that the shrapnel in his heart is causing him to bleed out.
Serge335544 (9:30:41 PM): God forbid that person try and wind down
Serge335544 (9:30:43 PM): Right?
Serge335544 (9:30:47 PM): Yeah, I guess that's right
fiery invective (9:30:48 PM): that
fiery invective (9:30:52 PM): was the worst analogy i've ever heard
fiery invective (9:30:54 PM): and you should feel ashamed
Serge335544 (9:31:08 PM): Analogy? That's what happend on Thursday.
Serge335544 (9:31:18 PM): But whatever
Serge335544 (9:31:20 PM): Go tell that to your buddies
fiery invective (9:31:22 PM): no, analogy, because you're comparing it to YOU DYING ON THE INTERNET
Serge335544 (9:31:25 PM): I'm sure I'll hear about it in the morning
fiery invective (9:31:28 PM): probably
Serge335544 (9:31:39 PM): I don't think I compared to that game at all
Serge335544 (9:32:26 PM): I believed I compared your douchbaggery of a person causing people who do activies that release stress from them causing them to be more stressed and thus, do stupid things
Serge335544 (9:32:31 PM): Was a general expression
fiery invective (9:32:46 PM): and then you tried to compare it to.. honestly
fiery invective (9:32:49 PM): why am i even trying to reason here
fiery invective (9:33:06 PM): when you're back in reality you know where to find me, i'm too lazy to hold grudges
Serge335544 (9:33:11 PM): I compared it to my stress, first hand example.
Serge335544 (9:34:00 PM): Whatever, this just gives me an extra hour to write the letter to his wife and child.
Serge335544 (9:34:12 PM): Maybe think about your actions for once and if they were wrong, then you'll see what I am talking about
Serge335544 (9:34:16 PM): Good bye.

The gentle crackle of the fireplace mingles with the sound of Schubertâs No. 8 in B minor. Dias himself, in a fine silk smoking jacket and sporting a golden pipe forged from one of his many Olympic gold medals reclines in an opulent leather armchair and toys with his Harvard pin. For long minutes all is tranquility, until the sound of his phone shatters the stillness.</p><p>Picking up his sixth generation Iphone, gifted to him by Steve Jobs for inventing telecommunications he confidently intoned, âDias speaking.â</p><p>A confident but supplicatory voice issued forth, âLord Dias this is Barack Obama, I wonder if you had a moment?â</p><p>âPlease Barry, it was the British royal family I saved and the British who knighted me! Itâs just Dias!â he responded generously.</p><p>âThank you, and thank you again for getting me elected, I think we both know the U.S was never going to be led by a black guy you didnât vouch for,â gushed the President.</p><p>âThink nothing of it, Obie, and I hope weâre still on for our weekly two on one basketball game this weekend.

On second thought&mldr;:P With regards to Dias, he seems to have trouble composing his temper and lies compulsively. You were trying to guilt, in a passive aggressive manner, this sort of detrimental behaviour can negatively impact other areas of your life later on in life, I suggest you seek help for it. There is nothing wrong with admitting you need help. Life is stressful for most people, it&rsquo;s no reason to expect favours especially since you, I&rsquo;ll assume you are being honest, chose that path. Don&rsquo;t expect anything from anyone, the world and those in it owe you nothing.</p><p>Everyone from Imperian is a little crazy, Dias just exudes his more than others.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6014a837177b06fcb63ae21bab9256a7?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by wispofdarkness@xxx on 11Â May 2010</p>Thanks Pareze, I guess?</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1926e216bda1b3a8c63459c63464bf85?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by ashel@xxx (author) on 03Â Nov 2010</p>I just wanted to remind anyone who might have forgotten that this is still the best log ever.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
