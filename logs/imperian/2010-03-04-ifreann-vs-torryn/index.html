I&rsquo;d make an alias that introduces all of your elements at once with a stroke of a button. That way you&rsquo;ll have all of your defenses come online at once. Start with everything that doesn&rsquo;t take EQ including grove calling, enemying, and what not all in one stroke and end with grove entanglement. Also make a separate alias for grove hinder/grove trap so that when they enter the area you can immediately hinder movement before the summon. Just.. rather pathetic he didn&rsquo;t touch shield.
