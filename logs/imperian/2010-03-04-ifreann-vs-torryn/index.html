Start with everything that doesn&rsquo;t take EQ including grove calling, enemying, and what not all in one stroke and end with grove entanglement. Also make a separate alias for grove hinder/grove trap so that when they enter the area you can immediately hinder movement before the summon. Just.. rather pathetic he didn&rsquo;t touch shield.
