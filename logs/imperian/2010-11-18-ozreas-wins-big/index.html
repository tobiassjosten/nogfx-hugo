A spacious town hall.
The spacious interior of this town hall seems to stretch for eternity, while the
rafters and beams supporting the ceiling give the structure an illusion of the 
inside of a massive boat. A multitude of simple benches rest on either side of a
long aisle, all facing a raised platform at the end of the hall. A small pellet 
of concentrated animal feed lies here. A large card table is stationed here. 
Vashir is here, a blank look in his eyes. He wields an Amber Sword in His right 
hand. Kaedrie is here, wreathed in divine fire. Lord Ozreas al-Hamasa is riding 
on a massive warhorse. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a weathered
silver shield in his right. Raedrin is here, wreathed in divine fire. Avain is 
here, wreathed in divine fire. Acolyte Sacathean is here.
You see a single exit leading out.
