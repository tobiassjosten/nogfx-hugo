Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. The once grand market square of ancient Caanae surrounds this 
centralized point, where the ground has been shaken and torn apart by a 
catastrophic event. Three meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic 
scripts lie collapsed upon the ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean
askew to one side of the stone pile, blocking the view from outside of all the 
wonders housed within this temple. Barely standing under the weight of a pillar
is a marble altar, which has been etched with scars and scratches from the 
passage of time and elements. The structure of the pillars silently displays 
how it was once a small but impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar 
indicate it to have been built in honor of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the 
cracks in the centre is a passage of pure water, perhaps the purest known in 
the realm of Aetherius. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the 
ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant 
river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A 
small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft 
light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a 
Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera,
a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble
rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop

a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. A tengu hovers 
gently over the ground here. Sergeant Islene is here, shrouded. She wields a 
curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway

You cut off your emanation of the word of power.
A beatific look of bliss appears on Islene's face as her ears begin to harden 
and turn to pure marble. The marble quickly spreads over her face and down her 
neck, turning her entire form white. After her entire body has been completely 
transformed, a fine skein of thin flame wreathes over the chest of the statue, 
imprinting a short passage onto it.
You have slain Islene.">Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil
lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A
well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan
Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a
goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite
sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an
ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble
foam about its mouth. A small sign points into a market stall. Tomast the

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. The once grand market square of ancient Caanae surrounds this
centralized point, where the ground has been shaken and torn apart by a
catastrophic event. Three meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic
scripts lie collapsed upon the ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean
askew to one side of the stone pile, blocking the view from outside of all the
wonders housed within this temple. Barely standing under the weight of a pillar
is a marble altar, which has been etched with scars and scratches from the
passage of time and elements. The structure of the pillars silently displays
how it was once a small but impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar
indicate it to have been built in honor of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the
cracks in the centre is a passage of pure water, perhaps the purest known in
the realm of Aetherius. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the
ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant
river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A
small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft
light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a
Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera,
a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey
granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble
rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop

An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a

the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. Hovering in the air is
a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. A tengu hovers
gently over the ground here. Sergeant Islene is here, shrouded. She wields a
curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her right.

If you don&rsquo;t have a harp, you can&rsquo;t parry their attacks while you are singing songs. They do lots of DPS to your paper tissue armor, and can blind and deaf without eating herbs. I&rsquo;m not sure if they get stunned by earthquake or not.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf6ba8df8dfcaaf54773e1311f830f6b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mbayliss1990@xxx on 04Â Mar 2010</p><p>Most people also need to change their curing to time it to where deafness comes before blindness.</p><p>Nevermind that I&rsquo;m an Amazon and the songbird and sketch can bite me.</p><p>But.. without the sketch and without stripping levitation so that earthquake can tick, a bard is honestly helpless most of the time.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eef50fe9676c8f5aafaaca0e447520ce?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mayena54@xxx on 04Â Mar 2010</p>FiancÃ©e, unless you are hiding something from us. Your description made me lol, ease up cowboy, this isn&rsquo;t Payback, you aren&rsquo;t Mel Gibson and flinging a churuta on the ground as you are walking away won&rsquo;t incite an explosion.

To codyharmor, yes I think she did think that would work. After I told her to fight me, she sat around doing nothing for three minutes and I am too nice to just jump people. She probably was hoping I would get bored and not notice until it is too late. And to tonykunz, about the no skill part, yeah Islene isn&rsquo;t that great but I make no claims to greatness either. If you look at the log you will see how horrible I did with linseed, I really need to remember to use it more often. :D</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c284e58fcd48b09f92c6e7b2a6b3a2da?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by codyharmor@xxx on 05Â Mar 2010</p>Ivellios, you&rsquo;re awesome.
