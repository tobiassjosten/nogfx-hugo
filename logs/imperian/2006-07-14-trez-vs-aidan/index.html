light a source of inspiration and life. A small sign points into a market 
stall. The towering presence of Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate 
the room here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A fearsome lion prowls around 
here and greets you with a warning roar. Gleaming slightly, a sturdy shortsword
is here. A scruffy grey alley cat sits here pointedly ignoring you as it cleans
its fur. A mighty redwood eagle soars through the air here, silent as a whisper
as its eyes focus upon the ground. A banded stallion stands here quietly 
regarding his surroundings. A ruinous hound growls excessively here. Barely
