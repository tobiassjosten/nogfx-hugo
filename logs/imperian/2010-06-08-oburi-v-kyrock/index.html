Inside the crumbled walls. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
This room has not been mapped.
The arena floor here is littered with debris that has accumulated over many years of disuse and
decay. Ivy creeps over the arena wall, while weeds and grass have managed to pierce through the hard
 rock of the floor. The overgrowth grows thicker as the path continues to the northwest. Kyrock,
Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the surroundings with a miasma of fear. He wields a curved sabre
 in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. A low grassless hill protrudes from the ground. 
You see exits leading northeast and northwest.
