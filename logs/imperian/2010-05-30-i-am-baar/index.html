He is an athletic Kohdon. He is slightly taller than most Kohdon, standing at roughly seven feet eight. Thick, lusterless scales of muted grey cover the muscles and bone of Aeorden&#39;s form, offering protection where his blackened armour fails to provide it. His body exists entirely of flexible muscles, combined with stronger and more durable ones. His posture is straight, broad shoulders and chest standing firm, a testament of his strong military upbringing. A large, scaled maw is covered in a horned helmet, chain covering the tender parts of his face. A remarkable set of stark white teeth are supplemented by the veritum bites on the helmet. His facial features are almost always stoic, scales discoloured on his upper jaw where they form a scar. From the eyes of the helmet, crimson eyes stare outwards, nearly always keeping a vigilant watch. On the back of his shoulder, the marks of a faded tattoo are visible, the words &#39;Diavlous Decerto!&#39; vaguely recognizable, a  complex of white scales forming the scar tissue that covers them. The entirety of his form is clad in scarred black and veritum armour, with delicate etchings in favour of the Lord of the Six Suns showing in bright gold. He is wearing a huge suit of Baarite armour, a pack resembling a bloody heart, a bronze armband of The Seven Suns, a hornbow, a black forearm sheath, a pair of high-polished black boots, a quiver, a set of razor-sharp kohdon spurs, a low-slung scabbard, a Baar-inspired band of gold, a tiny midnight-hued velvet pouch, a blackened Kohdon helmet, golden templar greaves, 8 pocketbelts, a white and gold uniform shirt, a pair of white and gold trousers, a lavish golden crown of hearts, a golden leather falconry glove, and a bladed tail ring. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a huge golden tower shield in his right.

l Ageranu
He is a fast Lycaean. He is surrounded by an aura of animal viciousness barely kept in check.  His dappled dark gray fur blends well with the shadows, and is clean and well maintained although criss-crossed with multiple scars, marks of battles won, hard fought..  His eyes reflect great joy in life, and show depths of great sorrow seen, and suffered, but his easy smile quickly chases away the pain.  His intense training has kept his body lean and supple, strong and rugged, and close inspection reveals a small tattoo on the inside of his left wrist, the word "Miichelle" surrounded 
by a love heart. ******************************************************************************. He is wearing a gold Taekate belt, a leather helm, Gloves of Harvesting, a mask of crystehl, a fang-embroidered leather pouch, 4 pocketbelts, a glass bubble, a jaguar-hide riding hat, a black Taekyon belt, a pair of rugged hide pants, a steelweave surcoat, an Outrider&#39;s cloak, 3 simple ring of silvers, a pair of leather vambraces, a pair of leather greaves, battered leather armour, an armband of the Threefold Path, a pocketbelt, a wyrmskin pack, a starburst satchel of silk, an earring of Gazali, a bronze armband of the Fist, a blood pendant, a wolf and squirrel signet ring, a Scholar&#39;s Sash, a Quicksilver Amulet, a simple rope belt, a gold bracelet with an A charm, a pair of Orphanim Angel wings, and an Illuminas ring.

Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. This has been marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. An armoured knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel before a fierce lion. The shop directory of Antioch rests here on a marble pedestal. Swaying slightly in the softest breeze, a lovely hammock of multi-hued silk and warm rosewood sits here. A beautifully crafted wicker birdcage is held aloft by a series of braided ribbons. Within the cage is a dainty golden sparrow, warbling a pleasant tune. An intricately carved muamrite guard&#39;s spear lies abandoned here.An elite Antioch cleric is manning a cannon here. She has seventy-six cannon balls. Yapping constantly, this small energetic dog runs around playfully. A massive groomed black stallion stands here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. (Baar, Lord of the Six Suns stands here, burning brightly.) Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al is here. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 

Baar lays a hand upon your shoulder.

Your body suddenly feels the overpowering presence of the Conflagrant One possess you.

You have emoted: Aeorden snarls, His voice taking on a harsher, more commanding quality, "You will ignore My Will? Laugh at My desires?"

You snarl, "I am the Conflagrant One. I speak through this shell! Kneel."

The peaceful form of Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana enters from the northeast.

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns glares balefully about the area.

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "Forgive me, if you are truly the Conflagrant One but I have lived a life where the words of mortals cannot be trusted. Surely you can show some sign you are He."

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "Then I shall gladly kneel in honour of Your presence."

You have emoted: Aeorden&#39;s eyes become fiercer all of a sudden.

Samiel looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

The room&#39;s temperature, despite it being the evening, becomes markedly more warm in temperature.

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "Awfully warm evening."

Jasmina arrives from the down.

The peaceful form of Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana enters from the northeast.

Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "Lord Baar stands wreathed in flames, would you not be standing in the same?"

Ageranu tilts his head curiously.

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "Excuse me."

Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana leaves to the west, a feeling of peace leaving with him.

You snort arrogantly.

You say, "Lord Baar doesn&#39;t show Himself before mortals. That is what I am for."

The peaceful form of Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana enters from the southwest.

Suddenly, great fire springs up around Aeorden&#39;s form.

Ageranu utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

Current Defences:
You are wreathed in divine fire.
You are protected by 28 defences.

Grandmistress Jasmina Askare says to Ageranu, "I fail to see what is so funny."

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "I&#39;m afraid I will not kneel before a mortal."

You say, "I am the Lord of the Suns. I am the Conflagrant Lord. I am Immortal."

Ageranu Agarwaen says to Jasmina, "Aeorden is mortal, no matter the theatrics he puts on."

Baar withdraws His hold over you.

You say, "You will kneel, or you will burn. Make your choice."

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "I kneel before no man."

You say, "Not before a man, Shah. Before Me."

You enact the Rite of Piety, the foundations of your devotion to the Lord of the Six Suns binding all within its grasp.

The fires about Aeorden flare brighter.

You order a regal white falcon to attack Ageranu.
A regal white falcon obeys your command.

You whip a curved sabre through the air in front of Ageranu, to no effect.

You move in to engage Ageranu.

You raise a curved sabre over your head and begin to swing it in a wide circle, gaining speed as you go.

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "Then if you are so, why make use of the marionette? Surely one such as an Immortal would have no need of a puppet."

You feel a faint touch in the farthest recesses of your mind.

You cease the whirling of your weapon over your head.
The paralysis of your muscles prevents you from doing that. (Paralysis)

You quickly eat a maidenhair leaf.(2 Left)
Your paralysis fades and you can move once more. (Paralysis)

You curl your lip and sneer arrogantly.

You drop back and ease the engagement.

You say to Samiel, "You are unworthy of viewing Him. You shall regard Me instead."

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al is here, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Tahm, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a truesilver sabre in his left hand and a round shield of burnished bronze in his right. (Baar, Lord of the Six Suns stands here, burning brightly.) Grandmistress Jasmina Askare is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "Unworthy, I have heeded the call of the Just Lord. His acceptance is the only approval I seek."

Ageranu Agarwaen nonchalantly inspects his fingers, rubbing his knuckles slightly, and cleaning his nails.

You set your terrifying gaze upon Ageranu, who pales visibly.

You kneel down and draw the holy power of the Rite of Piety into your body and feel an increase in your devotion.

The flames about Aeorden perish slowly.

You say, "Your blasphemous acts speak for themselves. You shall pay, Shah."

1 ) Baar: "Remember, My favored servant."
2 ) Baar: "A man can have nothing, but he can still have Faith."
3 ) Aeorden: "Yes, Lord. I shall remember it at all times."
4 ) Baar: "Do not let despair take you. Despair is the Demon. It is the to..."
5 ) Baar: "A small mind is a focused mind."
6 ) Aeorden: "Of course not, Lord. As long as I serve You, I know that I a..."
7 ) Baar: "Burning brightly, My Incinertate?"
8 ) Aeorden: "Of course, Lord. As always."
9 ) Baar: "I have appointed Icarius as the Ignitis of Zhov as per your rec..."
10) Aeorden: "That is good to hear, Lord. I&#39;m sure Icarius will serve You ..."
11) Baar: "There is only service."
12) Baar: "Your tolerance astounds Me."
13) Aeorden: "Tolerance of what, my Lord?"
14) Baar: "How you can persist in allowing these faithless Calixian fools ..."
15) Aeorden: "It&#39;s a matter of priorities, Lord. As disgusted as I am by t..."
16) Baar: "Faith, unlike innocence, is not offered in degrees of severity...."
17) Baar: "Antioch shows no faith in Me, and thus I am rejected."
18) Aeorden: "Acting against these heathens now would cause them to ban Yo..."
19) Baar: "Pfah. Ban *Me* from Antioch? This is My City."
20) Aeorden: "The Antiochans don&#39;t realize that, Lord. Half of the city is..."

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "I will kneel before Him out of respect for the Divine, but His Voice."

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "&#39;&#39;no."

You say, "I am more than His Voice. I am His Will, His Might. I am Him, and you shall act as such."

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "They do not get it, do they? You are *Me*. How else do I put it to them? I made you physically Me Incarnate before their very eyes."

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "No, I will not, your delusions are no longer amusing, Aeorden."

You say, "They are dense, Lord. I didn&#39;t expect anything else from a follower of Calix."

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "All the same, I refuse to regard a mortal in the same respect as one of the Divine."

Samiel gives a pained sigh.

You say, "In Your name, they shall be cleansed, Lord. I&#39;ll see to it."

Samiel raises an eyebrow questioningly.

You say, "Your lies are befitting of Calix. You claim to kneel before Him, but your acts speak for themselves."

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns spits balefully, His magnesium eyes narrowing into slits, "Fools."

Ageranu raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "My Lord is above suck insults, Aeorden, but they also smack of blasphemy, watch yourself."

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "Such, rather."

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m to be cleansed when I am in no need of it."

Samiel raises an eyebrow questioningly.

You say, "You refuse to kneel before the Lord of Aetherius. You refuse to kneel before the Conflagrant One."

You snarl, "And then you have the courage to accuse -Me- of blasphemy?"

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "Lord Baar, I know you can hear me, I am afraid Your presense has unsettled the mind of Your servant.. I wish him the best."

Guardas arrives from the southeast.
He is followed by an enormous, white woolly mammoth named Asdot.

You spit on the ground in disgust.

Samiel raises an eyebrow questioningly.

You say, "It is only by the worship of His faithful that Antioch is protected. It would do you well to remember that."

Flamedancer Tahm Kei&#39;daan says, "May the suns bless our swords as they strike the magickers, the demons, the impure."

You nod your acknowledgement of Tahm.

You say, "The tainted shall be removed from Aetherius by His faithful. The heretic shall burn."

Grandmistress Jasmina Askare says, "May the Suns bless my fists, as they strike true upon the Heretics."

Baar nods solemnly.

You say, "Your words please Him as they please Me. You shall be rewarded for your actions."

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "As she has been."

Ageranu Agarwaen smiles impishly and says to you, "But.. I thought you were Him?"

You say, "Semantics, Shah. Typical of a Calix worshipper."

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "I don&#39;t believe my chosen religion has anything to do with this discussion."

You say, "Oh. You call it a religion?"

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns frowns and says, "It has everything to do with it. Disgraceful heathen."

You say, "And here I was thinking it was a gaggle of thieves and liars."

You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.

You say, "One learns something new every day."

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "Enough."

Ageranu gives you a shifty little smile.

Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "I would suggest you curb your tongue, aye."

You say, "I thought Antioch was the city of free speech, and that no one&#39;s rights were to be held in check."

You suck thoughtfully on your teeth.

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "Seeing as you just called two city leaders either liars or thieves I should thing you should stop."

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says, "Think*."

You snort arrogantly.

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns frowns and says, "Any who does see My Power manifest and *dismiss* it deserves more than curt words."

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "Slander is not welcome."

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al looks skeptical and says, "Well I believe someone also thought it appropriate for some mortals to be held exempt from mortal law."

You say, "I am Baar. You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m being as generous as I am."

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "That is correct, but also Lord Calix is of the Pantheon here, and should be respected as such."

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "You are not Lord Baar."

Baar stares implacably at Guardas.

You say, "I am Him. He has said so - He has shown your unbelieving eyes a miracle, and you dismiss Him and Me out of hand."

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "You will point at this non-believer, and you will curse him with My wrath."

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "You are His chosen representative, no more, no less."

You say, "Which one, Lord? The Vahinite or the Calix worshipper?"

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "The one who claims you are not Me, despite My words and will."

You have emoted: Imperiously raising his arm, Aeorden points it at Ageranu. "You are a heathen, and you shall feel My wrath." Head tilted slightly, a slight grin forms on Aeorden&#39;s face.

Syndil inclines her head, piously clasping her hands before her and bows to Guardas respectfully.

Ageranu opens his mouth big and wide into a long yawn.

l Ager
He bears the burden of the disfavour of Baar.

Blyth&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement at Ageranu.

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "Ah, a Divine disfavour, interesting."

Jasmina kneels before you, swearing her allegiance to you.

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says, "What?"

You say to Jasmina, "Your service is appreciated."

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns snarls, "Now they kneel!"

You nod your head.

You say, "Yes, Lord, they do."

You slowly swing your reptilian tail back and forth in contentment.

Grandmistress Jasmina Askare says, "This enough is proof that Aeorden is indeed Lord Baar. A shame you did not heed His words sooner."

Your ally, Squire Lyon Zaridiux, has entered Imperian.
The body of Squire Lyon Zaridiux appears in a flash and his soul descends to fill it, causing the previously expressionless face to fill with emotion.

Lyon snaps to attention as he raises a clenched fist over his chest in salute.

Lyon climbs onto an armoured battle stallion.

Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana.  (Baar, Lord of the Six Suns stands here, burning brightly.) Grandmistress Jasmina Askare is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Blyth, Aspect of Aryana. She wields a sturdy shortsword in each hand. Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian is
here. He wields a Mace of Vahin in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Eye of the Lioness, Divanna Shinpachi, Onawa Kehu is here, camouflaged. Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al is here. Squire Lyon Zaridiux is riding on an armoured battle stallion. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

Ageranu Agarwaen says to Jasmina, "He is deluded, though your Lord seems to listen to him. I will stand tall however, and when this is over, I will still be Shah, and he will still be but a mortal, play acting at being a God."

Lyon&#39;s forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.

You say, "Ignorance is bliss. I must imagine that willful ignorance is the same."

Lyon ponders Ageranu&#39;s profile, wondering if it would make a suitable subject for a portrait.

You have emoted: Aeorden&#39;s head turns jerkily towards Lyon, as if under command.

Lyon gives you a respectful salute.

You have emoted: Aeorden snarls roughly, His voice gruff, "You are in the presence of your Lord. Kneel, Congregant!".

Lyon kneels before you, swearing his allegiance to you.

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "We&#39;ve told you this before, you are not Lord Baar."

Squire Lyon Zaridiux says, "My Lord, I apologize."

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says, "And no one is required to kneel to a mortal."

Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "Cease the blasphemy, before we find out how mortal you are."

Lyon&#39;s forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.

You say, "Your willful ignorance must be very convincing for you to believe it yourself. I have called My wrath down upon the Shah, and he walks with My disfavour. You cannot deny a God."

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "Say what you will, I will not be swayed from follow my Lord. My allegiance will go to the Just Lord and no one else. My loyalty will not falter."

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "Following Him even."

Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "Your coercive tactics won&#39;t work, Aeorden. For that is who you are, a man."

Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "I beg you, one last time, retract your statements, and acknowledge your mortality."

You curl your lip and sneer arrogantly.

You have emoted: Aeorden rumbles ominously, His voice significantly changed, "You witness My miracles before your very eyes, and you dismiss them? You dare, you who was once My Incinertate?".

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "I was once the Incineratate of Lord Baar, not a mortal."

From the center of the sky, Zhov casts sharp rays in every direction, dissipating shadow.

Draven arrives from the southwest.

You say, "And the Grand Mistress. She observes. She sees. She recognizes, and thus is rewarded."

You give Jasmina a solemn nod.

Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Jaivanna enters the room with a swift, ground-covering gait.

Jasmina gives you a solemn nod.

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "My loyalty will remain will Lord Vahin and I will acknowledge no truth other than His."

Sir Dias Tethe&#39;alla, The Vexatious Blade says, "You are no God, Aeorden."

Draven raises an eyebrow questioningly.

You snarl, "So serve your Just Lord. But you will not dare deny My Will."

Blyth raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "You ask me to kneel before a shell? A MORTAL shell...I will kneel to no man."

Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says to Samiel, "Calm."

Samiel gives a pained sigh.

Samiel gives Draven an acknowledging nod.

Lord Samiel Lirc&#39;al says, "Very well."

Grandmistress Jasmina Askare says, "You all test His patience, it is as if you would not be satisfied until purged within the fires He can produce."

Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "There will be no purging."

You have emoted: Trembling with indignity, Aeorden rumbles, "How I decide to bring Myself to the world is no concern of yours. Your duty is to acknowledge, and to kneel."

Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "I deny you, as I did before, I stand beneath His disfavour, but I will not kneel to a mortal. I would kneel to Him out of respect, but I will never kneel to you."

Dias nods his head at Ageranu, showing his acceptance.

Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "Very well, Lord Baar."

Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "If you choose to make commands through a mortal shell."

Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "Then perhaps we should see if your mortal shell as is immortal as You are."

Dias grins mischievously.

Guardas smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Sir Dias Tethe&#39;alla, The Vexatious Blade says, "I agree with you, Draven."

Jasmina clicks and chitters in agitation.

Lyon&#39;s knuckles grow momentarily white as he strengthens his grip.

You have emoted: Aeorden says, stoically confident, "Faith will protect this form."

You say, "All who acknowledge Me will defend this shell as you would My ways and My will."

Lyon moves to your side, ready to defend you against all foes.

Ageranu Agarwaen says, "So be it."

Sir Dias Tethe&#39;alla, The Vexatious Blade says to Lyon, "If you know what is good for yourself friend, you will stop."

Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "Very well. Shah, I cannot give my Lord&#39;s approval to slay this one, as he...mortal or not...as yet to take some action against us."

Ageranu brands you a traitor to Antioch and casts you out.

Ageranu has declared you a formal enemy of the City of Antioch.

Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "It would not be a protective measure."

A massive wooden bolt flies in from the southwest, impales you directly through the chest, lifting 
you off your feet.
You sail away to the northeast.Kinsarmar Road near the Shuk.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. This has been marked as holy
ground. A large, rusted raindrop iron key gathers dust on the ground here. Heated breath flaring his
nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A large orange tabby cat crouches in the 
shadows, its eyes following unseen prey. An elite Antioch cleric is manning a cannon here. She has 
eighty cannon balls. Wings quickly darting about, a peaceful pink dragonfly hovers here.

He is an athletic Kohdon. He is slightly taller than most Kohdon, standing at roughly seven feet eight. Thick, lusterless scales of muted grey cover the muscles and bone of Aeorden's form, offering protection where his blackened armour fails to provide it. His body exists entirely of flexible muscles, combined with stronger and more durable ones. His posture is straight, broad shoulders and chest standing firm, a testament of his strong military upbringing. A large, scaled maw is covered in a horned helmet, chain covering the tender parts of his face. A remarkable set of stark white teeth are supplemented by the veritum bites on the helmet. His facial features are almost always stoic, scales discoloured on his upper jaw where they form a scar. From the eyes of the helmet, crimson eyes stare outwards, nearly always keeping a vigilant watch. On the back of his shoulder, the marks of a faded tattoo are visible, the words 'Diavlous Decerto!' vaguely recognizable, a complex of white scales forming the scar tissue that covers them. The entirety of his form is clad in scarred black and veritum armour, with delicate etchings in favour of the Lord of the Six Suns showing in bright gold. He is wearing a huge suit of Baarite armour, a pack resembling a bloody heart, a bronze armband of The Seven Suns, a hornbow, a black forearm sheath, a pair of high-polished black boots, a quiver, a set of razor-sharp kohdon spurs, a low-slung scabbard, a Baar-inspired band of gold, a tiny midnight-hued velvet pouch, a blackened Kohdon helmet, golden templar greaves, 8 pocketbelts, a white and gold uniform shirt, a pair of white and gold trousers, a lavish golden crown of hearts, a golden leather falconry glove, and a bladed tail ring. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a huge golden tower shield in his right.

He is a fast Lycaean. He is surrounded by an aura of animal viciousness barely kept in check. His dappled dark gray fur blends well with the shadows, and is clean and well maintained although criss-crossed with multiple scars, marks of battles won, hard fought.. His eyes reflect great joy in life, and show depths of great sorrow seen, and suffered, but his easy smile quickly chases away the pain. His intense training has kept his body lean and supple, strong and rugged, and close inspection reveals a small tattoo on the inside of his left wrist, the word "Miichelle" surrounded
by a love heart. ******************************************************************************. He is wearing a gold Taekate belt, a leather helm, Gloves of Harvesting, a mask of crystehl, a fang-embroidered leather pouch, 4 pocketbelts, a glass bubble, a jaguar-hide riding hat, a black Taekyon belt, a pair of rugged hide pants, a steelweave surcoat, an Outrider's cloak, 3 simple ring of silvers, a pair of leather vambraces, a pair of leather greaves, battered leather armour, an armband of the Threefold Path, a pocketbelt, a wyrmskin pack, a starburst satchel of silk, an earring of Gazali, a bronze armband of the Fist, a blood pendant, a wolf and squirrel signet ring, a Scholar's Sash, a Quicksilver Amulet, a simple rope belt, a gold bracelet with an A charm, a pair of Orphanim Angel wings, and an Illuminas ring.
Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. This has been marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. An armoured knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel before a fierce lion. The shop directory of Antioch rests here on a marble pedestal. Swaying slightly in the softest breeze, a lovely hammock of multi-hued silk and warm rosewood sits here. A beautifully crafted wicker birdcage is held aloft by a series of braided ribbons. Within the cage is a dainty golden sparrow, warbling a pleasant tune. An intricately carved muamrite guard's spear lies abandoned here.An elite Antioch cleric is manning a cannon here. She has seventy-six cannon balls. Yapping constantly, this small energetic dog runs around playfully. A massive groomed black stallion stands here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. (Baar, Lord of the Six Suns stands here, burning brightly.) Lord Samiel Lirc'al is here. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
Baar lays a hand upon your shoulder.
Your body suddenly feels the overpowering presence of the Conflagrant One possess you.
You have emoted: Aeorden snarls, His voice taking on a harsher, more commanding quality, "You will ignore My Will? Laugh at My desires?"
You snarl, "I am the Conflagrant One. I speak through this shell! Kneel."
The peaceful form of Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana enters from the northeast.
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns glares balefully about the area.
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "Forgive me, if you are truly the Conflagrant One but I have lived a life where the words of mortals cannot be trusted. Surely you can show some sign you are He."
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "Then I shall gladly kneel in honour of Your presence."
You have emoted: Aeorden's eyes become fiercer all of a sudden.
Samiel looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
The room's temperature, despite it being the evening, becomes markedly more warm in temperature.
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "Awfully warm evening."
Jasmina arrives from the down.
The peaceful form of Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana enters from the northeast.
Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "Lord Baar stands wreathed in flames, would you not be standing in the same?"
Ageranu tilts his head curiously.
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "Excuse me."
Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana leaves to the west, a feeling of peace leaving with him.
You snort arrogantly.
You say, "Lord Baar doesn't show Himself before mortals. That is what I am for."
The peaceful form of Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana enters from the southwest.
Suddenly, great fire springs up around Aeorden's form.
Ageranu utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
Current Defences:
You are wreathed in divine fire.
You are protected by 28 defences.
Grandmistress Jasmina Askare says to Ageranu, "I fail to see what is so funny."
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "I'm afraid I will not kneel before a mortal."
You say, "I am the Lord of the Suns. I am the Conflagrant Lord. I am Immortal."
Ageranu Agarwaen says to Jasmina, "Aeorden is mortal, no matter the theatrics he puts on."
Baar withdraws His hold over you.
You say, "You will kneel, or you will burn. Make your choice."
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "I kneel before no man."
You say, "Not before a man, Shah. Before Me."
You enact the Rite of Piety, the foundations of your devotion to the Lord of the Six Suns binding all within its grasp.
The fires about Aeorden flare brighter.
You order a regal white falcon to attack Ageranu.
A regal white falcon obeys your command.
You whip a curved sabre through the air in front of Ageranu, to no effect.
You move in to engage Ageranu.
You raise a curved sabre over your head and begin to swing it in a wide circle, gaining speed as you go.
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "Then if you are so, why make use of the marionette? Surely one such as an Immortal would have no need of a puppet."
You feel a faint touch in the farthest recesses of your mind.
You cease the whirling of your weapon over your head.
The paralysis of your muscles prevents you from doing that. (Paralysis)
You quickly eat a maidenhair leaf.(2 Left)
Your paralysis fades and you can move once more. (Paralysis)
You curl your lip and sneer arrogantly.
You drop back and ease the engagement.
You say to Samiel, "You are unworthy of viewing Him. You shall regard Me instead."
Lord Samiel Lirc'al is here, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Tahm, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a truesilver sabre in his left hand and a round shield of burnished bronze in his right. (Baar, Lord of the Six Suns stands here, burning brightly.) Grandmistress Jasmina Askare is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "Unworthy, I have heeded the call of the Just Lord. His acceptance is the only approval I seek."
Ageranu Agarwaen nonchalantly inspects his fingers, rubbing his knuckles slightly, and cleaning his nails.
You set your terrifying gaze upon Ageranu, who pales visibly.
You kneel down and draw the holy power of the Rite of Piety into your body and feel an increase in your devotion.
The flames about Aeorden perish slowly.
You say, "Your blasphemous acts speak for themselves. You shall pay, Shah."
1 ) Baar: "Remember, My favored servant."
2 ) Baar: "A man can have nothing, but he can still have Faith."
3 ) Aeorden: "Yes, Lord. I shall remember it at all times."
4 ) Baar: "Do not let despair take you. Despair is the Demon. It is the to..."
5 ) Baar: "A small mind is a focused mind."
6 ) Aeorden: "Of course not, Lord. As long as I serve You, I know that I a..."
7 ) Baar: "Burning brightly, My Incinertate?"
8 ) Aeorden: "Of course, Lord. As always."
9 ) Baar: "I have appointed Icarius as the Ignitis of Zhov as per your rec..."
10) Aeorden: "That is good to hear, Lord. I'm sure Icarius will serve You ..."
11) Baar: "There is only service."
12) Baar: "Your tolerance astounds Me."
13) Aeorden: "Tolerance of what, my Lord?"
14) Baar: "How you can persist in allowing these faithless Calixian fools ..."
15) Aeorden: "It's a matter of priorities, Lord. As disgusted as I am by t..."
16) Baar: "Faith, unlike innocence, is not offered in degrees of severity...."
17) Baar: "Antioch shows no faith in Me, and thus I am rejected."
18) Aeorden: "Acting against these heathens now would cause them to ban Yo..."
19) Baar: "Pfah. Ban *Me* from Antioch? This is My City."
20) Aeorden: "The Antiochans don't realize that, Lord. Half of the city is..."
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "I will kneel before Him out of respect for the Divine, but His Voice."
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "''no."
You say, "I am more than His Voice. I am His Will, His Might. I am Him, and you shall act as such."
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "They do not get it, do they? You are *Me*. How else do I put it to them? I made you physically Me Incarnate before their very eyes."
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "No, I will not, your delusions are no longer amusing, Aeorden."
You say, "They are dense, Lord. I didn't expect anything else from a follower of Calix."
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "All the same, I refuse to regard a mortal in the same respect as one of the Divine."
Samiel gives a pained sigh.
You say, "In Your name, they shall be cleansed, Lord. I'll see to it."
Samiel raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You say, "Your lies are befitting of Calix. You claim to kneel before Him, but your acts speak for themselves."
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns spits balefully, His magnesium eyes narrowing into slits, "Fools."
Ageranu raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "My Lord is above suck insults, Aeorden, but they also smack of blasphemy, watch yourself."
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "Such, rather."
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "I'll be damned if I'm to be cleansed when I am in no need of it."
Samiel raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You say, "You refuse to kneel before the Lord of Aetherius. You refuse to kneel before the Conflagrant One."
You snarl, "And then you have the courage to accuse -Me- of blasphemy?"
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "Lord Baar, I know you can hear me, I am afraid Your presense has unsettled the mind of Your servant.. I wish him the best."
Guardas arrives from the southeast.
He is followed by an enormous, white woolly mammoth named Asdot.
You spit on the ground in disgust.
Samiel raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You say, "It is only by the worship of His faithful that Antioch is protected. It would do you well to remember that."
Flamedancer Tahm Kei'daan says, "May the suns bless our swords as they strike the magickers, the demons, the impure."
You nod your acknowledgement of Tahm.
You say, "The tainted shall be removed from Aetherius by His faithful. The heretic shall burn."
Grandmistress Jasmina Askare says, "May the Suns bless my fists, as they strike true upon the Heretics."
Baar nods solemnly.
You say, "Your words please Him as they please Me. You shall be rewarded for your actions."
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "As she has been."
Ageranu Agarwaen smiles impishly and says to you, "But.. I thought you were Him?"
You say, "Semantics, Shah. Typical of a Calix worshipper."
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "I don't believe my chosen religion has anything to do with this discussion."
You say, "Oh. You call it a religion?"
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns frowns and says, "It has everything to do with it. Disgraceful heathen."
You say, "And here I was thinking it was a gaggle of thieves and liars."
You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.
You say, "One learns something new every day."
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "Enough."
Ageranu gives you a shifty little smile.
Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "I would suggest you curb your tongue, aye."
You say, "I thought Antioch was the city of free speech, and that no one's rights were to be held in check."
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth.
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "Seeing as you just called two city leaders either liars or thieves I should thing you should stop."
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says, "Think*."
You snort arrogantly.
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns frowns and says, "Any who does see My Power manifest and *dismiss* it deserves more than curt words."
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "Slander is not welcome."
Lord Samiel Lirc'al looks skeptical and says, "Well I believe someone also thought it appropriate for some mortals to be held exempt from mortal law."
You say, "I am Baar. You're lucky I'm being as generous as I am."
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "That is correct, but also Lord Calix is of the Pantheon here, and should be respected as such."
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "You are not Lord Baar."
Baar stares implacably at Guardas.
You say, "I am Him. He has said so - He has shown your unbelieving eyes a miracle, and you dismiss Him and Me out of hand."
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "You will point at this non-believer, and you will curse him with My wrath."
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "You are His chosen representative, no more, no less."
You say, "Which one, Lord? The Vahinite or the Calix worshipper?"
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "The one who claims you are not Me, despite My words and will."
You have emoted: Imperiously raising his arm, Aeorden points it at Ageranu. "You are a heathen, and you shall feel My wrath." Head tilted slightly, a slight grin forms on Aeorden's face.
Syndil inclines her head, piously clasping her hands before her and bows to Guardas respectfully.
Ageranu opens his mouth big and wide into a long yawn.
l Ager
He bears the burden of the disfavour of Baar.
Blyth's eyes sparkle with amusement at Ageranu.
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "Ah, a Divine disfavour, interesting."
Jasmina kneels before you, swearing her allegiance to you.
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says, "What?"
You say to Jasmina, "Your service is appreciated."
Baar, Lord of the Six Suns snarls, "Now they kneel!"
You nod your head.
You say, "Yes, Lord, they do."
You slowly swing your reptilian tail back and forth in contentment.
Grandmistress Jasmina Askare says, "This enough is proof that Aeorden is indeed Lord Baar. A shame you did not heed His words sooner."
Your ally, Squire Lyon Zaridiux, has entered Imperian.
The body of Squire Lyon Zaridiux appears in a flash and his soul descends to fill it, causing the previously expressionless face to fill with emotion.
Lyon snaps to attention as he raises a clenched fist over his chest in salute.
Lyon climbs onto an armoured battle stallion.
Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana. (Baar, Lord of the Six Suns stands here, burning brightly.) Grandmistress Jasmina Askare is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Blyth, Aspect of Aryana. She wields a sturdy shortsword in each hand. Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian is
here. He wields a Mace of Vahin in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Eye of the Lioness, Divanna Shinpachi, Onawa Kehu is here, camouflaged. Lord Samiel Lirc'al is here. Squire Lyon Zaridiux is riding on an armoured battle stallion. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.
Ageranu Agarwaen says to Jasmina, "He is deluded, though your Lord seems to listen to him. I will stand tall however, and when this is over, I will still be Shah, and he will still be but a mortal, play acting at being a God."
Lyon's forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.
You say, "Ignorance is bliss. I must imagine that willful ignorance is the same."
Lyon ponders Ageranu's profile, wondering if it would make a suitable subject for a portrait.
You have emoted: Aeorden's head turns jerkily towards Lyon, as if under command.
Lyon gives you a respectful salute.
You have emoted: Aeorden snarls roughly, His voice gruff, "You are in the presence of your Lord. Kneel, Congregant!".
Lyon kneels before you, swearing his allegiance to you.
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "We've told you this before, you are not Lord Baar."
Squire Lyon Zaridiux says, "My Lord, I apologize."
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says, "And no one is required to kneel to a mortal."
Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "Cease the blasphemy, before we find out how mortal you are."
Lyon's forked tongue flickers out briefly as he tests the air.
You say, "Your willful ignorance must be very convincing for you to believe it yourself. I have called My wrath down upon the Shah, and he walks with My disfavour. You cannot deny a God."
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "Say what you will, I will not be swayed from follow my Lord. My allegiance will go to the Just Lord and no one else. My loyalty will not falter."
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "Following Him even."
Sri Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian says to you, "Your coercive tactics won't work, Aeorden. For that is who you are, a man."
Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "I beg you, one last time, retract your statements, and acknowledge your mortality."
You curl your lip and sneer arrogantly.
You have emoted: Aeorden rumbles ominously, His voice significantly changed, "You witness My miracles before your very eyes, and you dismiss them? You dare, you who was once My Incinertate?".
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "I was once the Incineratate of Lord Baar, not a mortal."
From the center of the sky, Zhov casts sharp rays in every direction, dissipating shadow.
Draven arrives from the southwest.
You say, "And the Grand Mistress. She observes. She sees. She recognizes, and thus is rewarded."
You give Jasmina a solemn nod.
Lyon swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
Jaivanna enters the room with a swift, ground-covering gait.
Jasmina gives you a solemn nod.
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "My loyalty will remain will Lord Vahin and I will acknowledge no truth other than His."
Sir Dias Tethe'alla, The Vexatious Blade says, "You are no God, Aeorden."
Draven raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You snarl, "So serve your Just Lord. But you will not dare deny My Will."
Blyth raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "You ask me to kneel before a shell? A MORTAL shell...I will kneel to no man."
Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says to Samiel, "Calm."
Samiel gives a pained sigh.
Samiel gives Draven an acknowledging nod.
Lord Samiel Lirc'al says, "Very well."
Grandmistress Jasmina Askare says, "You all test His patience, it is as if you would not be satisfied until purged within the fires He can produce."
Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "There will be no purging."
You have emoted: Trembling with indignity, Aeorden rumbles, "How I decide to bring Myself to the world is no concern of yours. Your duty is to acknowledge, and to kneel."
Ageranu Agarwaen says to you, "I deny you, as I did before, I stand beneath His disfavour, but I will not kneel to a mortal. I would kneel to Him out of respect, but I will never kneel to you."
Dias nods his head at Ageranu, showing his acceptance.
Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "Very well, Lord Baar."
Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "If you choose to make commands through a mortal shell."
Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "Then perhaps we should see if your mortal shell as is immortal as You are."
Dias grins mischievously.
Guardas smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Sir Dias Tethe'alla, The Vexatious Blade says, "I agree with you, Draven."
Jasmina clicks and chitters in agitation.
Lyon's knuckles grow momentarily white as he strengthens his grip.
You have emoted: Aeorden says, stoically confident, "Faith will protect this form."
You say, "All who acknowledge Me will defend this shell as you would My ways and My will."
Lyon moves to your side, ready to defend you against all foes.
Ageranu Agarwaen says, "So be it."
Sir Dias Tethe'alla, The Vexatious Blade says to Lyon, "If you know what is good for yourself friend, you will stop."
Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "Very well. Shah, I cannot give my Lord's approval to slay this one, as he...mortal or not...as yet to take some action against us."
Ageranu brands you a traitor to Antioch and casts you out.
Ageranu has declared you a formal enemy of the City of Antioch.
Holy Avenger Draven Acerbus says, "It would not be a protective measure."
A massive wooden bolt flies in from the southwest, impales you directly through the chest, lifting
you off your feet.
You sail away to the northeast.Kinsarmar Road near the Shuk.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. This has been marked as holy
ground. A large, rusted raindrop iron key gathers dust on the ground here. Heated breath flaring his
nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A large orange tabby cat crouches in the
shadows, its eyes following unseen prey. An elite Antioch cleric is manning a cannon here. She has
eighty cannon balls. Wings quickly darting about, a peaceful pink dragonfly hovers here.
You see exits leading northeast, southwest, and in.
You are separated from Lyon. He can no longer defend you.
You sail away to the northeast.Kinsarmar Road inside Caanae Gate.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. This has been marked as holy

You see exits leading southwest, northwest, in, and a set of ornately wrought, massive gates stand

Obligatory Trez remark-
Trez tells you, "Ohshit."
(Order): Baar says, "So. They dare destroy Me."
(Congregation): Jasmina says, "What would you have me do, Lord Baar? I fear I cannot withstand such tacky methods of removal."
(Congregation): Baar says, "To attack My shell is to attack Me."
(Congregation): Baar says, "I take this as personal offense."
(Congregation): Baar says, "The insolent fools dare mock Me as I stand before them."
(Congregation): Jasmina says, "I fear I cannot teach these heathens to behave properly, my Lord, without suffering the same fate as Your shell."
(Congregation): Akhim says, "Hail, Lord Baar."
(Congregation): Baar says, "You will serve as I demand, as the Incinertate, Me upon this land, serves as I demand."
(Congregation): You say, "Congregants. You shall heed My words and act upon them."
(Congregation): You say, "The city of Antioch has rejected Me. They have rejected My protection."
(Congregation): You say, "Their fate shall be more horrible than any mortal mind can fathom. Your duty is to gather all those faithful to Me, and to worship Me."
(Congregation): You say, "Worship Me, and you shall be protected. Antioch has condemned itself."
(Congregation): You say, "Spread My word, and you shall be rewarded. Serve Me well, and you shall be protected. For now, take no action against Antioch itself. They shall learn their own fate soon enough."</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+8 points with 12 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6144f1e88e5225310dc304b44dd9abc?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by hrfrioniel@xxx on 30Â May 2010</p>I have to vote this down because Dias was in it.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3fd57273d1cd45f320a85ecd7ad20bec?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by falcon32252003@xxx on 30Â May 2010</p>I have to say, that is pretty cool.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c5df9e599455621170a8da145006a54?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by john.morton@xxx on 31Â May 2010</p><p>I must say, I love that he edited out some of the stuff that made him look bad&mldr; like just after he kohdon feared Ageranu&mldr;.</p><p>Aeorden kneels down and draws the holy power of the Rite of Piety into his

It seems to me, given that Baar has traditionally been an arrogant SOB of a God, that it is perfectly sound RP for him/his order. I am a little disappointed to see that the &ldquo;Holy City&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t play along at least a -little- better, though. There are several ways to take something of a stand against a God&rsquo;s actions without being an annoying little jerk in the process. :/ You completely destroy a divine&rsquo;s rp when you do nothing but &ldquo;Psh. It&rsquo;s not like you can really -hurt- me, or anything.
