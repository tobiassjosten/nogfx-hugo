I'm attacking Nasr because he attacked me the other day, I don't really have
much interaction with him because he's not a Stavennite and usually just putzs about in a city all day, so I'm not quite certain how I've been warned about this 'alt revealing'.  Honestly if it is his alt, which I think it is, that wasn't my intention in the least.  I use 'Grantz' as a derogatory term, sort of like a synonym for idiot.  I typically refer to people by another persons name to insult them.  Sort of like, I have to go to the bathroom and drop a big fat Grantz.  (just an example)

&#34;Nasr's issue #96906 against you has been upheld. It's clear from your yells 
that you were blatantly and directly referring to Nasr as Grantz. Furthermore, you used your issue response, wherein you're only discussing the issue with Imperian's Administration, to make some inane reference to defecating. For lying to Imperian's Administration and using the issue system to further insult Nasr, you will be truedisfavoured for 72 hours.&#34;

&#34;You also need to change your return message, immediately.&#34;

You sent the following message to Apoloc:
'Apoloc would like you to know that: (Burt): Selthis says, &#34;Oh man, I was tryin to go down on her while oyu were railing her anally and somehow I touched your dick with my tongue. My bad man.&#34;">Issue #96906 Reported by: Nasr Re: Apoloc
