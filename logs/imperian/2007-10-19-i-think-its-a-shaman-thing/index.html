Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles 
listlessly in the wind. There are 12 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. The 
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, 
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with the crest of the 
Empire ripples regally from the columns of the gates. A sigil in the shape of a
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. There are 5 Diavlous Knights 
here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a cannon here. He has thirty-seven cannon 
balls. An ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally decorated pedestal 
here. A roan mustang is here, its long, full mane flowing freely in the wind. 
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. A glowing red flame-shaped sigil 
has been left here. Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst is here, delirious. A black 
ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Kephas 
Bezaliel is here, shrouded. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in his left hand and 
a tower shield in his right. Hursh Murne, Gedar kir Idun is here. Tonbee is 
here, shrouded. He wields a living vodun doll of Tonbee in his left hand and a 
tower shield in his right. Kephas Bezaliel is here.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east
