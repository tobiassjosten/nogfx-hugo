It&rsquo;s sad. And Jugs is super fail. Ranger ain&rsquo;t even close to a good combat class. I beat him as a level 65 Diab that wasn&rsquo;t even tri transed. That whole clan doesn&rsquo;t know the first thing about combat. They know 3 or more > 1.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx on 16Â Aug 2011</p>Funny how Virtus is killed time and time again by pretty much everyone.
