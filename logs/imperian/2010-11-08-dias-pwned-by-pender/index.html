Like I&rsquo;d risk my chance to be close to you Dias &lt;3. I have ALOT more evil and damaging things to say, as I am sure you do as well, IF &ldquo;I&rdquo; were to commit Imperian suicide. I&rsquo;d blow out more then your lil tiny insignificant lid. If I were gonna go out, I&rsquo;d go out HUGE!!!! Why bother being a lil lamiran male either. Not my style. If I&rsquo;d go I&rsquo;d go as Lyla or, even better, as Sasha, the one that this whole 6+ year mess started with. All because Dias couldn&rsquo;t have her. Oh, you never told that one did you? Where you asked her to break the engagement and to leave Xohln and she said no, how you offered her thousands of dollars to leave him and she said no. When that didn&rsquo;t work you went OOC and told Xohln she cheat on him with Dias to break them up. Didn&rsquo;t tell them that&rsquo;s the kind of asshole you are did you? Trying to destroy me like that. Got news kid. Yer not worth going green over. Now. Excuse me but I have to get back to anything better to do then deal with a supposed Military guy who I am ashamed to say doesn&rsquo;t act or behave like one. OH! Happy Veteran&rsquo;s Day!!!!</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
