Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious 
glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you 
with its many eyes. A black, murky mist has settled here. Dripping with blood, 
an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the 
form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A stinking 
noxious cloud floats here. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from 
the ground. Fahrer is here, shrouded. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his
left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and southwest.

South of a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
To the north, the great arches that once represented the triumphant gates of a 
mighty arena lie in near ruins. The road that winds around the walls of the 
arena is in fairly decent state here, as most of it is whole. A few cracks in 
the road are visible more because of the various grasses and flowers that grow 
out of them than the black lines that would usually accompany such cracks. 
Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious 
glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you 
with its many eyes. A black, murky mist has settled here. Dripping with blood, 
an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the 
form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A stinking 
noxious cloud floats here. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. Hands 
of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Fahrer is here, 
shrouded. He is holding a tower shield in his right hand.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and southwest.

South of a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious
glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you
with its many eyes. A black, murky mist has settled here. Dripping with blood,
an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the
form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A stinking
noxious cloud floats here. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from
the ground. Fahrer is here, shrouded. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his
left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and southwest.

South of a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
To the north, the great arches that once represented the triumphant gates of a
mighty arena lie in near ruins. The road that winds around the walls of the
arena is in fairly decent state here, as most of it is whole. A few cracks in
the road are visible more because of the various grasses and flowers that grow
out of them than the black lines that would usually accompany such cracks.
Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious
glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you
with its many eyes. A black, murky mist has settled here. Dripping with blood,
an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the
form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A stinking
noxious cloud floats here. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. Hands
of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Fahrer is here,
shrouded. He is holding a tower shield in his right hand.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and southwest.

Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious
glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you
with its many eyes. A black, murky mist has settled here. Dripping with blood,
an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the
form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Fahrer is
here, sprawled on the ground. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his left
hand and a tower shield in his right.
