Aryana&#39;s Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. Lying on the ground is a 
broadsword. A small orphine seed lies here. A vibrant crimson embroidered 
hammock hangs here, its ruby beads glimmering slightly with each gentle 
movement of the wind. A small sign points into a market stall. A withering 
corojo leaf lies here. A single steel shot lies here, yet to be fired. A roan 
mustang is here, its long, full mane flowing freely in the wind. Advancing with
teeth bared, the wolverine objects to the intrusion. A knife of what looks to 
be bone has been dropped here. The towering presence of Peravus, ancient 
Caananite seems to dominate the room here. Kerial stands here, sharp blue eyes 
watching intently. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the 
Springs. A snow white falcon is perched here. Hovering silently upon glistening
wings, a snow-dusted ebon songbird flits about here. Brydian Sunjackal, Roving 
Vagabond is here. Lady Snow, Ysaviel Sunjackal, the Staff of Winter is here. 
She wields a tower shield in her left hand and an exquisite sandalwood harp 
adorned with sapphire dragonflies in her right. Gui Anar is here. He holds a 
truesilver shield in each hand. Dzarth is here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Brydian nudges Ysaviel suggestively.

Ysaviel&#39;s eyes gleam with generosity.

Ysaviel gives the corpse of the Fleshreaver to Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood.

Ysaviel thumps Selthis on the forehead.

Ysaviel rubs her hands together greedily.

Selthis peers about himself unscrupulously.

Lady Snow, Ysaviel Sunjackal, the Staff of Winter says, "Tear that apart, will 
you please."

Brydian waves his hand in the air at Selthis and shouts a hearty, "Ahoy!"

A shimmering image of the corpse of the Fleshreaver appears before you. It is 
shrouded in darkness.

Brydian nods sagely.

Brydian ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Brydian, "Thanks."

Brydian Sunjackal, Roving Vagabond says to Selthis, "Tell me what y&#39;find?"

Selthis gives Brydian an acknowledging nod.

(Wardens): Selthis says, "Anyone who wants to see the Fleshreaver dissected, 
come to the keep."

(Wardens): Selthis says, "To the Infirmary to be more precise."

In the arboretum hall. (Warden Guildhall.)
You see exits leading north, south, and in.

In a cold and overgrown courtyard. (Warden Guildhall.)
A wooden trebuchet is here, waiting to be fired.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, and up.

The Stone Infirmary. (Warden Guildhall.)
Black Pines Strangler, Savreth Amherst, General of the Night is here, giving 
off a truly ghastly stench. Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood is here. He wields 
a black iron glaive in his left hand. You see a single exit leading east.

(Wanderers): Selthis says, "Kethean, are you interested in seeing a dissection 
of some sort of demon created creature?"

(Wanderers): Selthis says, "It should be somewhat interesting."

(Wanderers): Kethean says, "Sure?"

(Wanderers): You say, "We like to dissect them to learn more about them."

(Wanderers): Kethean says, "Yeah, I&#39;d like to go."

Selthis nods his head.

Selthis drops the corpse of the Fleshreaver.

 p fleshreaver
Various animal-parts slowly dissolve apart as the slain golem lays upon the 
ground, its perverse appetite for devastation quelled.
It weighs about 154 pounds.
You see nothing in it.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil sniffs at the corpse, chitin adjusting to expose nasal 
vents.

You nod your acknowledgement of Kethean.

Kethean nods his head.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Gah, more Horde."

You say, "The Idras can handle this wave, Fury."

Selthis nods his head.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So, this is what Slythera called the 
Fleshreaver."

Patek pokes at the corpse of the Fleshreaver.

Patek ponders the situation.

Patek swings his tail aimlessly.

You close your eyes and slowly inhale, allowing the scent of the corpse of the 
Fleshreaver to fill you.

You growl menacingly.

Hivarius gnaws intently on the corpse of the Fleshreaver.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil scrapes at the corpse with the edge of a knife, 
experimentally.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "To me, it looks like an amalgam of 
various other creatures."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Ground together, perhaps."

Patek ponders the situation.

You gag a bit as you inhale your own stink.
[Spam of stink messages from myself and Hivarius henceforth gagged]

Wanderer Kethean says, "So I&#39;m going to guess you guys stink because of that?"

Wanderer Kethean points at the dead golem.

Wanderer Kethean says, "Because honestly, guys, you smell great."

Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "That would be correct."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Although it is debatable in the case of 
Hivarius."

Garmin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

You chuckle long and heartily.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Either way."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "I wonder of the animals chosen..."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "If they were chosen."

Patek shrugs helplessly.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "As do I."

Patek tilts his head curiously at Selthis.

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I am not sure if they were chosen for a 
particular reason or not."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or if it was just sort of a random 
assortment of animal parts."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or even if they are totally natural 
creatures."

Patek licks the corpse of the Fleshreaver.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Doesn&#39;t taste especially unnatural."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Odd, given its current state."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "&#39;Their&#39; current state?"

Patek ponders the situation.

Patek shrugs helplessly.

Patek gnaws intently on a Vorpal Knife.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or perhaps it was a natural creature, 
melded together and perverted through her demonic magicks."

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Well, dismantle it and learn more about it?"

You nod your head at Hivarius, showing your acceptance.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "That was the plan."

Hivarius sucks thoughtfully on a handsome gold link necklace.

Kethean closes his eyes and bows his head.

Hivarius swings his arm at Kethean wildly.
Hivarius connects.

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says to Kethean, "No need to meditate now."

Kethean winces in pain.

Wanderer Kethean says, "I thought it might help with the stink?"

Wanderer Kethean shrugs and watches.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil lights a torch of pitch-soaked pine to dispel some of 
the stench.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil places the torch in an iron brace on the wall.

Selthis ceases to wield a black iron glaive in his left hand.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood takes the knife up in his hand and apporaches 
the creature.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Careful. Could parts of it still, hrm, live?"

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Perhaps not, but still."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I would hope not."

Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It died all at once?"

Selthis nods his head.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So far as I know."

Patek nods his head.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Sounds safe enough, I suppose."

Garmin wrinkles his nose and sniffs.

Garmin gives Patek an acknowledging nod.

Patek nods sagely at himself.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood places the tip of the knife at the crest of the
forehead, and presses down, the knife slicing easily into  melting flesh.  
Dragging the knife along the edge of the creature&#39;s face, he cuts a long swath 
nearly completely around its face.

Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head in all directions quickly, taking in the
area.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood motions Kethean over.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "C&#39;mere boy."

Patek nudges Kethean with his smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.

Wanderer Kethean moves over to check out the sliced open head.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Get your hands in there and peel back 
the skin so the skull is exposed."

Wanderer Kethean sighs, but smiles. He kneels and reaches out to get ahold of 
the loose skin.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Just pull it back slow but 
steady."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head towards the corpse of the Fleshreaver, 
clicking quietly to himself, perceiving with suspicion.

Wanderer Kethean grasps a chunk of skin and starts to peel it back, slowly.  
"Like this?" he asks.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns towards the exposed bone and gristle and 
considers.

Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Like that."

You say to Kethean, "Keep going."

Patek sniffs the corpse of the Fleshreaver, trying to decipher just what that 
smell emanating from him is.

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "We need the whole front of the skull 
exposed, to compare to normal mortal musculature."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "You can learn a lot about a 
creature by studying anatomy."

You nod your head at Selthis, showing your acceptance.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Bits of... what creature is that? Canid, to a 
degree, by the smell? Making most of the head..."

Patek tilts his head curiously at Selthis.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I am not sure."

Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Almost like a stubby snouted wolf."

Wanderer Kethean bites his bottom lip, the skin slipping from his fists.  He 
regrasps and tears heard at the remained that&#39;s still attached.

You nod your acknowledgement of Kethean.

Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger leans forward, watching intently.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Wipe your hands, better grip."

Patek gives a spool of cloth to Wanderer Kethean.

Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Patek ponders the situation.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Notice the jaw though?"

Patek gnaws intently on a locust-horn necklace.

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Not canid."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood reaches down and pries it open slightly.

Wanderer Kethean takes the cloth, wiping them off, and goes back for a second 
try.  This time his grasp remains true, and pulls the remainder of the face 
off.

You say to Kethean, "Well done. Thanks."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil runs his claws over the teeth lightly.

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its an odd jaw, powerful. Obviously not 
from a plant eater."

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But I can&#39;t place it exactly."

You purse your lips, deep in thought.

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian strokes the skull shortly, taking a better idea of the 
shape.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Maybe a kochlan."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Similar, somewhat."

Selthis nods his head.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It is."

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Have they been spotted in Llus then?"

Patek shakes his head.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "This one was in Caanae."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Llus has been quite free of invaders."

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "I then doubt it is a kochlan."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Slythera summoned it."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its not that it is a kochlan."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its made from assorted creatures."

You say, "Just part of it might be kochlan."

Hivarius ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."

Wanderer Kethean stands with a grunt, dropping the flesh to the ground with a 
wet flop.  He peers at the skull for the first time, and remarks, "Check out 
that grin."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Likely chosen to cause the most pain."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Mainly the teeth - but then, many sharp teeth 
are there...

Patek shrugs helplessly.

Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head towards the exposed teeth and 
musculature, clicking quietly to himself, perceiving with suspicion.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I suppose it is of little concern."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But it seems an apt choice for misery."

You say, "What&#39;s important is that the head itself is not even from solely
one creature."

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Its brain?"

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "If one exists within, even."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Such a creature, perhaps, might even lack such. 
What purpose would a mind have in such?"

You shake your head at Patek.

Patek tilts his head curiously at you.

You say, "Even demons have brains. They just can only comprehend destruction.
I suspect this has a brain of sorts."

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Although."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "This is a created creature."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It does little but serve the will of its
master."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "What use would it have for a brain?"

Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

You say, "True."

You say, "Only one way to find out, eh?"

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Is the animation magickal, necromantic, or of 
other nature?"

Patek ponders the situation.

You say to Patek, "Judging from the runes where it was summoned, I would say 
basic necromancy."

You say to Patek, "The runes were primitive to modern Lorekeeper and Wytchen
runes and they were scrawled in blood."

Patek ponders the situation.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Still, that speaks of magickal nature."

Wanderer Kethean rubs his bloodied hands on the clean part of the cloth, 
focusing on the skull.  He holds the cloth out to Patek, "You be wantin&#39; this 
back?" he asks, still looking at the creature.

Patek gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Please."

Kethean gives a spool of cloth to Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood sets up his jigsaw near the creatures head and 
begins to pump it, the blade making a loud whirring noise.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil leans over, sniffing at the smoke coming from the cut 
in the bone.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Acrid."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Okay, now gently push the 
skull into the jigsaw and hold it steady."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "But once you feel any give, 
stop."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "We don&#39;t want destroy what 
we&#39;re trying to examine."

Wanderer Kethean nods to Selthis, kneeling down again.  He grasps hold of the 
skull with one hand, and the saw with the other, pushing down firmly.

Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger winces as fine bone particles fly all around.

Hivarius&#39;s ears prick up suddenly.

Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil tastes the air.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Good good."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The bone does not smell aged, particularly."

Hivarius sniffs the corpse of the Fleshreaver, trying to decipher just what 
that smell emanating from him is.

Wanderer Kethean grimaces as he works, and then suddenly stops.  "Therrit goes.
Better not move that saw anymore," he says.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Help him turn the body, that way we can 
just pop off the whole top of his skull at once."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil hoists up the body beside Kethean.

Patek prods the corpse of the Fleshreaver in the chest.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Heavy thing."

Patek nudges Kethean with his smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Doing well."

Wanderer Kethean says, "Want me ta cut all the way &#39;round, then?"

Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Think of it as uncorking a bottle."

Selthis grins mischievously.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Although I&#39;m not sure you&#39;d want to 
drink what he has to offer."

You give Selthis a wry, shifty smile.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil wraps his tail around the legs of the corpus for better
leverage.

Wanderer Kethean says, "The front might be a tad bit inta, sorry about that. 
Pushin&#39; too hard."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "We&#39;ll manage."

Wanderer Kethean carefully removes the saw from the skull.  He places it beside
the head, and moves closer to try and flip the golem over.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil discreetly dips a claw into the gristle at the 
creature&#39;s jaw, and licks his hand, considering the taste.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil hoists the corpse up a bit to assist.

Garmin raises an eyebrow at Patek.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Garmin, "Tastes like meat, simply."

Garmin nods his head.

Patek gags a few times then vomits his last meal all over the floor.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Ergh."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Well."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Perhaps not like... good meat."

Garmin gives a canteen of whiskey to Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil.

Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "Calm your stomach.."

Patek creases his brow in a frown.

Patek shakes his head.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Garmin, "I can&#39;t, but thank you."

Garmin shrugs helplessly.

[-The following has been left intact in this log to show just how awesome Selthis is-

(Ring): Selthis says, "I should just totally fuck this up."

(Ring): You say, "Lol."

(Ring): Selthis says, "By emoting out violating the creature anally. :(."

(Ring): You say, "Please don&#39;t."

(Ring): You say, "ROFL."

(Ring): You say, "Now stop talking on the ring and ruining my log :/."

-End of Selthis being special.-]


Wanderer Kethean grunts and heaves with Patek, sending the corpse rolling over.
He curses under his breath and catches the head before the roll is complete.

Wanderer Kethean says, "Don&#39;t wanna have the front gettin&#39; messy."

Patek pats Kethean in a friendly manner.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Nicely done."

Wanderer Kethean grabs the saw again, and starts near the first cut, starting 
from the edge of the cut.

Patek ponders the situation.

Wanderer Kethean clenches his teeth as he pumps his arm in long, smooth 
strokes, sending the saw back and forth on the head, skin tearing above the 
unexposed bone.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil holds the head steady against the sawing.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns towards the canid eyes in their sockets, 
glistening succulently and considers.

Wanderer Kethean slows the saw down as it begins to bite into bone.  The sawing
continues to steadily slow down, until he stops completely.  He wipes some 
sweat off his forehead with a forearm, and then moves to the back of the head.
 
Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Low on the skull, I think."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Nearly done."
 
Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "It&#39;s certainly thick skulled.."

You snicker at Garmin.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Garmin, "Well it is a Demoner&#39;s 
creation."
 
Garmin nods his head at Selthis, showing his acceptance.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Garmin, "They&#39;re molded after their 
masters."
 
Selthis nods his head.
 
You smirk.

Garmin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
 
Wanderer Kethean moves a bit faster now that he&#39;s got a fair judge on the 
thickness of the skull, and in a few moments the top of the skull starts 
bobbing loosely.  Kethean grins, and palms the top of the head and begins 
twisting carefully.
 
Patek nods his head.
 
Wanderer Kethean pulls the top clean off, a thick trail of slimey goo reluctant
to let go.  He grins, looking around, holding the part of the skull.  "Anyone 
need a new helm&#39;t?" he says, and laughs.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks once, and turns his head upwards.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head upwards, chitters softly, and considers 
the space above him.
 
Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger smiles and says to Kethean, "..good clean cut."
 
Selthis snickers at Kethean.
 
Selthis nods his head.

You nod your acknowledgement of Kethean.
 
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood shoves a hand and feels around in the cavity of
the skull.
 
Patek tilts his head curiously at Selthis.
 
Selthis shakes his head.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Nothing."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Just this slime."
 
Garmin raises an eyebrow questioningly.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Nothing?"
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Selthis shakes his head.

You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.

You say, "Figures."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Nothing at all."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil sticks a claw into the slime, and sniffs at it.
 
Patek wrinkles his nose disfavourably.

Ignoring the world around you, you study the corpse of the Fleshreaver 
intently.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Anything on the bottom of the
skull?"
 
Wanderer Kethean stands and moves a few steps back from the corpse.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian slices a small bit of slime with the tip of his glaive.
 
Hivarius wrinkles his nose and sniffs.

Hivarius licks a blade-tipped glaive.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Clean it out? Perhaps runes animate this... 
thing&#39;s will."

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "They may be inked within or without its skull, 
if they are there."

You nod your acknowledgement of Patek.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood cups his hand and scoops the goo out onto a 
drain channel on the floor.

You have emoted: Arcitens leans over the skull and sniffs inside, taking in the
disgusting scent of the slime.
 
You have emoted: Arcitens uses a paw to wipe the greenish slime from inside the
skull, exposing a blood-red rune embossed in the skull.

You say to Patek, "Good guess."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Does anyone recognize it?"
 
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

You say, "Not I."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil traces its contours, considering.
 
Wanderer Kethean examines the teeth on the saw in one hand, and the cut on the 
half-skull in his other.  He moves the half-skull over to his other elbow, 
holding it between his body.  He grabs the cloth and begins wiping down the 
saw.
 
Garmin peers at the corpse of the Fleshreaver unscrupulously.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It looks vaguely similar to the one 
sketched in Caanae, doesn&#39;t it?"

You nod your head affirmatively at Selthis.

You say, "But as I said, it is different from Lorekeeper and Wytchen runes."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But it could just be that all runes look
alike."
 
Selthis gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

You chuckle long and heartily.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Don&#39;t ask me, I can barely read common."
 
Kethean chuckles long and heartily.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It&#39;s not a rune I&#39;ve perceived before."
 
Patek shrugs helplessly.
 
You say to Selthis, "The runes all have different symbols. And this looks 
different from any I have seen."

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Well, clearly is what a demon is designed for ain&#39;t 
it?"
 
Wanderer Kethean get&#39;s the saw semiclean, which is pretty good with an already 
used cloth.  He drapes the cloth on his shoulder and grasps the skull in his 
hand again.

You say to Kethean, "Make a necklace out of it maybe."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or a hat, I&#39;m sure the ladies would love
that."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The Wildgraf, perhaps."

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "A hat with a mark, somethin you would give to a 
lady?"

Wanderer Kethean chuckles at everyone, and tosses the skull so it lands near 
the body with a hollow sound.  "Or maybe, Ah&#39;ll just leave it with it&#39;s 
rightfull owner." He grins.

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The stench from it seems to increase over time. 
Perhaps the wall-hides absorb the stench and magnify it."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or perhaps it seems to be decaying 
faster."
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.

You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Perhaps. The odor of decay is stronger."
 
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

You say, "I think it decays faster than natural creatures."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Anyway."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So we see the controlling link."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its obviously not a sentient creature."
 
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

You say, "Simply controlled by Slythera."
 
Selthis nods his head.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Nothing it was made from, at least from cursory 
inspection."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "All seem non-sentient. Some bird, also some 
ursus."
 
Selthis nods his head.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And you&#39;ll also notice the exposed ribs 
on its body."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil pokes at the body.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Note the structure here? Poorly assembled, with 
ribs sticking out so."
 
Patek grins mischievously at Selthis.
 
Patek nods his head.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "The creatures were obviously dead when 
harvested from."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "My exact thought."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So its not as if some magick merged all 
of them together while still living."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "My only hope is that that Krugtha fellow
isn&#39;t involved."

You say, "Which explains why it is decaying more quickly - it&#39;s already been 
dead."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Still - fresh kills when it was assembled, I
think."
 
Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Agreed."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or else the flesh would be sloughing off
before it even existed."

You say to Selthis, "Good point."

Patek nods his head.

Wanderer Kethean tilts his head as he watches. He absentmindedly pops his 
knuckles.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "This state, though, doesn&#39;t seem to agree with 
the component parts."
 
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, I suppose it is time to explore 
the body cavity."

You pat Kethean in a friendly manner.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Slice above the ribs, perhaps?"
 
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

You ask, "Or down the middle?"
 
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Where is the middle on this, though..."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The lines are all wrong on it."
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah&#39;ve gotta&#39;n idea."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Here is what you do."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Cut below the ribs. 
horizontally and at each flank cut down vertically. enough of the sternum is 
exposed we can pry it open and crack &#39;em back."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "It&#39;ll save some time."
 
Selthis urges Kethean onwards.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah was juss plannin&#39; on punching below the sternum and 
prying the ribs back."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "True, but we need to expose the gut 
too."
 
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "To see if it even has any sort of 
digestive tract."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Selthis, "Was it observed eating?"
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah can&#39;t juss reach in and pull em out?"
 
Wanderer Kethean grins, moving over to the torso.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "That&#39;s a disembowelling, not 
a dissection."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Patek, "And I have no clue."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I personally doubt it has any real 
internal organs."
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Could Ah get a dagger?"

You take a long, sharp dagger from a dark leather satchel.

You give a long, sharp dagger to Wanderer Kethean.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "If it doesn&#39;t have a brain, my guess it 
has no guts."
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Patek nods his head.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "If it was made to kill, aye."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "And that seems likely, eh?"

You nod your head in agreement.

You say, "It&#39;s only purpose was to kill. It doesn&#39;t need the normal functions 
of a living creature."
 
Selthis nods his head.
 
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But we must pursue the option anyway."
 
You nod your head in agreement.
 
Wanderer Kethean nods, taking the dagger, tossing it in the air and reversing 
his grip when he catches it.  He kneels down and leans over the chest.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "I am going for an even worse smell."
 
Hivarius sucks thoughtfully on a handsome gold link necklace.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Hivarius, "You&#39;re well on your way.."
 
Patek hums quietly to himself.

Hivarius narrows his eyes at Patek in an unnerving manner.

Hivarius shrinks from the implacable gaze of Patek.

Patek grins mischievously at Hivarius.

Wanderer Kethean considers the thickness of the flesh, then considers the 
knife, and then just stabs the dagger in, stopping it about halfway in.
 
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Now I think we better need to get the attention to 
the demon, I&#39;m gettin hungry staring at you."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks once, and turns his head upwards.

Hivarius licks his lips.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Pull back carefully - the guts should
be seen intact."
 
Selthis nods his head.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And Gods help us if it has a bowel and 
you puncture it."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "You think it smells bad now."

You snicker softly to yourself.
 
"Ewwwwwwwww!" says Patek in disgust.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "You ain&#39;t seen nothing."
 
Wanderer Kethean bites his tongue as he begins saw-cutting the flesh open from 
the hole right below the sternum.  A vile ooze gushes out of the puncture.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "You might even faint."
 
Patek wrinkles his nose disfavourably.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Glad I ain&#39;t a Lyke sometimes."

"Meh," you mutter at Hivarius with a scowl.

Hivarius sticks his tongue out at you.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Lycaeans are fine."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The right garnish, and even better."

Patek nods sagely at himself.

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "They got a better nose."
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah&#39;m pretty sure Ah didn&#39;t punch inta the organs..."

You say to Kethean, "Good. You&#39;re doing well."
 
Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "Strange...I expected more blood. Perhaps
the creatures were drained first?"
 
You scratch your head looking for an idea.
 
Patek ponders the situation.

You say, "Or the blood is congealed already." 

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, if they&#39;re from dead creatures."

You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.
 
"Aye," Garmin mutters aloud.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "They would likely have no blood."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Given that the parts were taken from many 
creatures, it makes sense that the blood would have drained, aye."
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Usually, there&#39;s not allotta blud when yar openin&#39; them
up like this anyway."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "But usually better, tastier smells..."
 
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says to Patek, "You cant have everything."

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Hivarius, "That&#39;s what they tell you, 
but its bullshit."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Hivarius, "It all depends on how bad 
you want it."

Patek gnaws intently on a dried, dead flower.

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says to Selthis, "Dont get me started."
 
Wanderer Kethean slips his free hand into the new gash he created, feeling 
around for the other edge.  He finds it and lifts the flesh up, the cut 
becoming cleaner with the new space.  He cuts the horizontal cut right below 
the sternum, and starts a line down the flanks, lifting the large slap of skin 
as he goes.
 
Wanderer Kethean cuts the other flank down, gets a better hold of the flap, and
opens the body up like a book, tossing the "cover" of flesh onto the groin, 
exposing the innards.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Well, there ya have it."
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Selthis scratches his head in confusion.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil leans over the cavity, chitin twitching furiously 
around his nasal passages.
 
Patek looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
 
Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger leans forward, peering into the void of the 
creature&#39;s chest.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I..."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Don&#39;t see anything."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Not even much of that slime."
 
Selthis scratches his head in confusion.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Which is to be expected I suppose."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Truly a thing of limited purpose."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But you&#39;d think the cavity would be full
of the slime."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Like the skull."
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
You purse your lips, deep in thought.

You ask, "Maybe the slime was a sort of primitive brain?"

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The slime - it did not smell like spoiled meat."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Something added?"

You shrug helplessly.

Wanderer Kethean stands, wiping some of the slime off his face with a forearm.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It is likely something added."
 
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
  
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian puts his head inside the body for the moment.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Think you can yell in it for an echo."
 
Hivarius mutters discontentedly.

You chuckle long and heartily at Hivarius.
 
Garmin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Reach up there into the chest
and feel around."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Tell us if you feel anything?
I figure not."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But eh."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Cracking the chest won&#39;t really be 
necessary if there&#39;s nothing to see."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Hrm... some demons spit a slime which smells 
similar. Did this thing spit?"
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Not that i recall."
 
Patek gnaws intently on a rough hide.
 
Wanderer Kethean spits off to the side, the smell getting to him for a sec.  He
wipes the dagger clean, toss-flipping it again and catching the blade, holding 
it up.  "Ah can&#39;t remember who handed me this...".

You say to Kethean, "I did."
 
Kethean gives a long, sharp dagger to you.

You nod your acknowledgement of Kethean.

You lick a long, sharp dagger.

You say, "Doesn&#39;t taste like the skull did either."

You put a long, sharp dagger into a dark leather satchel.
 
You scratch your head looking for an idea.

You ask Selthis, "So what now?"
 
Wanderer Kethean moves back to the corpse, kneeling by it.  He leans down, 
sliding his hand up the chest cavity.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to you, "Now we examine a few parts that 
are attached to each other."

Wanderer Kethean reaches in shoulder-deep. He raises his eyebrow, feeling 
around.

The corpse settles slightly, the cutting and prodding taking its toll on its 
structural integrity.
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It seems to be decaying with some speed."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It does."
  
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Anything?"
 
Wanderer Kethean curses as he shifts with the corpse. He braces himself with 
his free hand and pulls out a slime covered arm.  "Lov&#39;ly," he says, as he 
examines the ooze.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "We&#39;ve got a spring, you can 
clean up there afterwards."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And then we&#39;ll get a drink in you."

Kethean chuckles long and heartily.

You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil pokes one of the limbs, noting its near detachment from
the trunk.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It truly seems to be near falling apart."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It was stronger, more... coherent, when I first 
arrived."

Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah think Ah&#39;ve got an idea about this slime..."
 
Selthis tilts his head and listens intently to Kethean.
 
"Oh?" Garmin exclaims quizzically.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Interestin&#39;ly enuff, when Ah was reachin around inside,
there wasn&#39;t much slime."
 
Selthis nods his head.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Then the bugger started fallin&#39; &#39;part. It released more
of this stuff."

Patek ponders the situation.
 
You purse your lips, deep in thought.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Like the skin is made of slime?"
 
Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "Or absorbed it somehow..?"
 
Wanderer Kethean shakes his arm off to the side, sending the ooze flying.  
"More like we found it&#39;s lifeblud."  He shrugs.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, that is what I was thinking too."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "A lot of demons have the same sort of 
fluid in them. I&#39;ve noticed it before when I killed them."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And Patek pointed it out as well."

Wanderer Kethean says, "Try cuttin&#39; open the arms an&#39; legs, see if more of the 
stuff seeps out."
 
You say, "So that slime subsitutes for its brain, its blood, and its organs all
in one."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, what if that slime came from a 
demon?"
 
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I mean, its already a creation of 
various parts."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Like the slimes a noctusari can summon to them?"

Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Who is to say that it doesn&#39;t get it 
fuel from something else."

Garmin tilts his head and listens intently.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil scoops up a small bit of the slime into a birchwood 
vial, and caps it carefully.
 
Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
 
Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger says to Patek, "Good idea."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil lights a punk with his tinderbox, and melts a bit of 
wax around the edge of the vial&#39;s cap.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Can&#39;t be too sure."

Wanderer Kethean grimaces, wiping the more stubborn ooze on his tunic.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Its fine until it starts 
dissolving your flesh."

You give a mischievous grin.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Then comes the screaming..."
 
Selthis nods his head.
 
Patek nods sagely at himself.
 
Garmin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Lots and lots of screaming."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But anyway."
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "An&#39; then you buy me more then one drink, Ah&#39;m thinkin&#39;"
 
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Another drink for every digit that comes
up missing."
 
Patek grins mischievously.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "3 per limb."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its the standard rate."
 
Wanderer Kethean rubs his chin in though, and shrugs.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "And you would have the honour to drink it all."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "The only question that remains for me is
this."
 
You tilt your head and listen intently to Selthis.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its obvious how it is attached 
externally."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "You can see the remnants of the 
stitching."
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Garmin nods his head.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But how is it done internally that 
allows movement."
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Held together with magick?"

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "For example."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "This arm is obviously from a monkey or 
something."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And its hooked into what appears to be a
bear&#39;s shoulder socket."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil tugs at the stitching material, considering.
 
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The stitching appears to be sinew, ripped from 
some living thing."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil tugs a bit of stitching free, and gnaws at it briefly.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "This bit tastes of cat."
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Brothers, Ah think the thing was grown tagether."

You tilt your head curiously at Kethean.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Muscle just does not attach to foreign 
muscle though."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "If I cut of Arcitens&#39; arm and then 
Hivarius&#39;, and switched tehm."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "They&#39;d just rot."

Kethean chuckles long and heartily.

"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Selthis, "That could be tested...."
 
Patek hums quietly to himself.
 
You give Patek the once-over, eyeing him suspiciously.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to you, "If you lost an arm only, of course."

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says to Patek, "We could try yours and Garmin&#39;s rather."

Garmin peers at Hivarius unscrupulously.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Selthis, "I with an elf&#39;s arm, and he with an 
Akrabi&#39;s.... an odd pair we&#39;d make."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Patek, "You could do a road show in 
Antioch."

Garmin grins mischievously at Selthis.

Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Would be fun if it worked."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Patek, "I&#39;m sure they&#39;d love it."
 
"Ewwwwwwwww!" says Patek in disgust.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "I&#39;ll pass, I think."

You say, "Back to the matter at hand, men."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "The arm doesn&#39;t just grow into the stump
of the old."

You say to Selthis, "Well then Kethean&#39;s suggestion makes sense."

Wanderer Kethean spits off to the side again.
 
Selthis nods his head.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It does."

You say, "If different parts of different creatures were taken and then grown
into a new creature, then when that new creature is born it would function
close to if it were naturally that way."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "In a way."
 
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The heat would make it rot faster, if nothing 
else."
 
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It was probably done via magick."

Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah think it&#39;s pretty safe ta say it was magick... An&#39; 
if it matters, the ooze that began fillin&#39; it up was pretty warm."
 
Hivarius nods his head.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "That is all I can figure."

You nod your head.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Becuase sadly, normal animals do not 
suffer adding appendages from other animals well."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Though I know some trees do."

You nod your head at Selthis, showing your acceptance.
 
Patek smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
 
Patek nods his head.

You say, "There&#39;s another avenue we haven&#39;t explored."
 
Selthis tilts his head and listens intently to you.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "What would that be?"
 
You say, "We don&#39;t know where this thing was born or grown or whathaveyou."
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Stavenn would have been an option."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "A pit... such things, pits. Always seems to be 
pits involved. Mind you, just a guess."

Garmin smirks.

You nod your acknowledgement of Patek.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, she summoned it."

You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.

You say, "If it was created in the demonic realm, for example..."

You say, "I would venture to guess that the animals were taken from our realm, 
reassembled unnaturally elsewhere, and summoned back here through those runes."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So my guess in the invader&#39;s homeland or
in the demon realm."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "She seemed to be the sort that would be 
at home in either."

You say, "Precisely."
 
You say, "And she does seem to have seem to be a demonologist of sorts."
 
Selthis nods his head.

With a barely audible &#39;plop&#39; the flesh of the creature&#39;s left hand sloughs off 
from the body and falls to the floor
 
Selthis peers about himself unscrupulously.

You blink.
 
Garmin puts his hands on his hips and goes "Hmmm!"
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil toes the goo on the floor about.
 
Hivarius Arda&#39;Tsian says, "Well, there goes the creature."
 
Hivarius gives a pained sigh.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood pokes the thigh of the creature, his fingertip 
piercing the weakening flesh.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil grasps a limb, and squeezes - and the limb separates 
easily.
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
You purse your lips, deep in thought.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "If only they were all like this, all the time. 
They wouldn&#39;t be a threat."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I wonder if she was the one keeping it 
structurally sound."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Sort of a one use thing, then when she 
didn&#39;t need it, she just release it and it would disappear on its own?"
 
Patek ponders the situation.
 
Patek nods his head.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "So it seems."
 
More of the flesh of the arm seems to begin to run down the side of the slab.
 
Selthis creases his brow in a frown.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "This is going to be a mess."
 
Patek wrinkles his nose disfavourably.
 
Patek prods the corpse of the Fleshreaver in the chest.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Now wouldnit be a bugger...."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Guess what you gotta do 
before you get your free drinks?"

"Heh heh heh," you chuckle at Selthis.
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Very little to it retains integrity."
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah figured as much."

Patek pokes in the empty air.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Nothing left to it, really."
 
The corpse jiggles wildly for a moment, before splitting and liquifying, most 
of it running into several channels on the floor.
  
Selthis peers about himself unscrupulously.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Okay."

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "That was nasty."

You say, "To be expected though."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Remind me to lay down a drip cloth or 
something next time."

You chuckle long and heartily.

Garmin grins mischievously.
 
You say, "Will do, Fury."
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Saw that comin&#39;, too."
 
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Well, a bit late..."
 
Patek pokes at a rough hide.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "You did good boy."
 
Selthis reaches over and gives Kethean a friendly noogie.
 
You nod your head in agreement.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s the clean hand."

Wanderer Kethean says, "No matter, Ah&#39;m filthy an&#39;way." 

Patek nods sagely at Kethean.
 
You say to Kethean, "I can show you where our spring is if you wanna wash up."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "C&#39;mon, lets go get washed up and we&#39;ll 
go spend some time at the Tavern."
 
You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.

You say, "Sounds good."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The tavern, hrm."
 
You say to Patek, "There&#39;s cider there too."

Patek nods his head.

Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Patek, "Pesky Illuminai."

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks once, and turns his head upwards.

You nod your head in agreement.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Meet you there, then."

Selthis nods his head.

Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head in all directions quickly, taking in the
area.

You beckon to Kethean.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "Now, Ah&#39;ve got somethin&#39; pickin&#39; me brain...."
 
Garmin raises an eyebrow at Kethean.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "That ooze... If it is lifeblud... Can it make another 
one?"

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "The bones seemed to lose their bonds 
when the flesh fell apart."

You say to Kethean, "Doubtful, but just to be safe..."
 
You have emoted: Arcitens grabs a bit of the what&#39;s left of the skull of the 
floor. He puts a paw inside it and rubs over the red rune repeatedly, until it 
finally smudges away.


You say to Kethean, "I doubt it could be revived now."
 
Selthis nods his head.
 
Kethean nods his head.

You say to Kethean, "Follow me lad."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Worse comes to worse, we&#39;ll take the 
bones to my campground and burn &#39;em."
 
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Not a bad idea actually."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood gathers up most of the bones.
 
Wanderer Kethean says, "I juss hope no one tosses some corpses on the 
remainders, and a new one grows up."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Someone else grab the rest."
 
Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "That&#39;d suggest we were right, they 
weren&#39;t physically joined."

You say, "I think Slythera&#39;s lost her interest."
 
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And I&#39;ll meet you at the Junction."
 
Selthis lowers his head and closes his eyes, as though trying to rememeber 
something.

You say to Selthis, "Will do."
 
Selthis snaps his head up suddenly and quickly darts off.

Kethean begins to follow you.
 
Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger rubs his hands together.

You say to Garmin, "Mind grabbing the bones while I take Kethean to wash up?"
 
Garmin enthuses, "Sure!"
 
You nod your acknowledgement of Garmin.

Garmin Arda&#39;Tsian, Elven Ranger gathers together the remnants of bone from the 
stone floor.

You nod your head.

You say, "See you back at the Tavern."

Kethean follows you to the east.
In a cold and overgrown courtyard. (Warden Guildhall.)
A wooden trebuchet is here, waiting to be fired.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, and up.

Kethean follows you to the north.
At the fireside. (Warden Guildhall.)
A great skull, crowned by horns and bristling with teeth, hangs from the wall 
here.
You see a single exit leading south and down (hidden).

[So we washed up and proceeded to get drunk at the Tavern. The End!]'>(Wardens): Selthis says, "Anyone want to see that fleshreaver thing dissected?"
(Wardens): Savreth says, "Gladly."
(Wardens): You say, "Could be interesting."
Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. Lying on the ground is a
broadsword. A small orphine seed lies here. A vibrant crimson embroidered
hammock hangs here, its ruby beads glimmering slightly with each gentle
movement of the wind. A small sign points into a market stall. A withering
corojo leaf lies here. A single steel shot lies here, yet to be fired. A roan
mustang is here, its long, full mane flowing freely in the wind. Advancing with
teeth bared, the wolverine objects to the intrusion. A knife of what looks to
be bone has been dropped here. The towering presence of Peravus, ancient
Caananite seems to dominate the room here. Kerial stands here, sharp blue eyes
watching intently. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the
Springs. A snow white falcon is perched here. Hovering silently upon glistening
wings, a snow-dusted ebon songbird flits about here. Brydian Sunjackal, Roving
Vagabond is here. Lady Snow, Ysaviel Sunjackal, the Staff of Winter is here.
She wields a tower shield in her left hand and an exquisite sandalwood harp
adorned with sapphire dragonflies in her right. Gui Anar is here. He holds a
truesilver shield in each hand. Dzarth is here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway
leads down.
Brydian nudges Ysaviel suggestively.
Ysaviel's eyes gleam with generosity.
Ysaviel gives the corpse of the Fleshreaver to Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood.
Ysaviel thumps Selthis on the forehead.
Ysaviel rubs her hands together greedily.
Selthis peers about himself unscrupulously.
Lady Snow, Ysaviel Sunjackal, the Staff of Winter says, "Tear that apart, will
you please."
Brydian waves his hand in the air at Selthis and shouts a hearty, "Ahoy!"
A shimmering image of the corpse of the Fleshreaver appears before you. It is
shrouded in darkness.
Brydian nods sagely.
Brydian ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Brydian, "Thanks."
Brydian Sunjackal, Roving Vagabond says to Selthis, "Tell me what y'find?"
Selthis gives Brydian an acknowledging nod.
(Wardens): Selthis says, "Anyone who wants to see the Fleshreaver dissected,
come to the keep."
(Wardens): Selthis says, "To the Infirmary to be more precise."
In the arboretum hall. (Warden Guildhall.)
You see exits leading north, south, and in.
In a cold and overgrown courtyard. (Warden Guildhall.)
A wooden trebuchet is here, waiting to be fired.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, and up.
The Stone Infirmary. (Warden Guildhall.)
Black Pines Strangler, Savreth Amherst, General of the Night is here, giving
off a truly ghastly stench. Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood is here. He wields
a black iron glaive in his left hand. You see a single exit leading east.

(Wanderers): Selthis says, "Kethean, are you interested in seeing a dissection
of some sort of demon created creature?"
(Wanderers): Selthis says, "It should be somewhat interesting."
(Wanderers): Kethean says, "Sure?"
(Wanderers): You say, "We like to dissect them to learn more about them."
(Wanderers): Kethean says, "Yeah, I'd like to go."
Selthis nods his head.
Selthis drops the corpse of the Fleshreaver.
p fleshreaver
Various animal-parts slowly dissolve apart as the slain golem lays upon the
ground, its perverse appetite for devastation quelled.
It weighs about 154 pounds.
You see nothing in it.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil sniffs at the corpse, chitin adjusting to expose nasal
vents.
You nod your acknowledgement of Kethean.
Kethean nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Gah, more Horde."
You say, "The Idras can handle this wave, Fury."
Selthis nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So, this is what Slythera called the
Fleshreaver."
Patek pokes at the corpse of the Fleshreaver.
Patek ponders the situation.
Patek swings his tail aimlessly.
You close your eyes and slowly inhale, allowing the scent of the corpse of the
Fleshreaver to fill you.
You growl menacingly.
Hivarius gnaws intently on the corpse of the Fleshreaver.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil scrapes at the corpse with the edge of a knife,
experimentally.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "To me, it looks like an amalgam of
various other creatures."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Ground together, perhaps."
Patek ponders the situation.
You gag a bit as you inhale your own stink.
[Spam of stink messages from myself and Hivarius henceforth gagged]
Wanderer Kethean says, "So I'm going to guess you guys stink because of that?"
Wanderer Kethean points at the dead golem.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Because honestly, guys, you smell great."
Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "That would be correct."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Although it is debatable in the case of
Hivarius."
Garmin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
You chuckle long and heartily.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Either way."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "I wonder of the animals chosen..."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "If they were chosen."
Patek shrugs helplessly.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "As do I."
Patek tilts his head curiously at Selthis.
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I am not sure if they were chosen for a
particular reason or not."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or if it was just sort of a random
assortment of animal parts."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or even if they are totally natural
creatures."
Patek licks the corpse of the Fleshreaver.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Doesn't taste especially unnatural."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Odd, given its current state."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "'Their' current state?"
Patek ponders the situation.
Patek shrugs helplessly.
Patek gnaws intently on a Vorpal Knife.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or perhaps it was a natural creature,
melded together and perverted through her demonic magicks."
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Well, dismantle it and learn more about it?"
You nod your head at Hivarius, showing your acceptance.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "That was the plan."
Hivarius sucks thoughtfully on a handsome gold link necklace.
Kethean closes his eyes and bows his head.
Hivarius swings his arm at Kethean wildly.
Hivarius connects.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says to Kethean, "No need to meditate now."
Kethean winces in pain.
Wanderer Kethean says, "I thought it might help with the stink?"
Wanderer Kethean shrugs and watches.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil lights a torch of pitch-soaked pine to dispel some of
the stench.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil places the torch in an iron brace on the wall.
Selthis ceases to wield a black iron glaive in his left hand.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood takes the knife up in his hand and apporaches
the creature.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Careful. Could parts of it still, hrm, live?"
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Perhaps not, but still."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I would hope not."
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It died all at once?"
Selthis nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So far as I know."
Patek nods his head.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Sounds safe enough, I suppose."
Garmin wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
Garmin gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
Patek nods sagely at himself.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood places the tip of the knife at the crest of the
forehead, and presses down, the knife slicing easily into melting flesh.
Dragging the knife along the edge of the creature's face, he cuts a long swath
nearly completely around its face.
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head in all directions quickly, taking in the
area.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood motions Kethean over.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "C'mere boy."
Patek nudges Kethean with his smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.
Wanderer Kethean moves over to check out the sliced open head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Get your hands in there and peel back
the skin so the skull is exposed."
Wanderer Kethean sighs, but smiles. He kneels and reaches out to get ahold of
the loose skin.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Just pull it back slow but
steady."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head towards the corpse of the Fleshreaver,
clicking quietly to himself, perceiving with suspicion.
Wanderer Kethean grasps a chunk of skin and starts to peel it back, slowly.
"Like this?" he asks.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns towards the exposed bone and gristle and
considers.
Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Like that."
You say to Kethean, "Keep going."
Patek sniffs the corpse of the Fleshreaver, trying to decipher just what that
smell emanating from him is.
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "We need the whole front of the skull
exposed, to compare to normal mortal musculature."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "You can learn a lot about a
creature by studying anatomy."
You nod your head at Selthis, showing your acceptance.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Bits of... what creature is that? Canid, to a
degree, by the smell? Making most of the head..."
Patek tilts his head curiously at Selthis.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I am not sure."
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Almost like a stubby snouted wolf."
Wanderer Kethean bites his bottom lip, the skin slipping from his fists. He
regrasps and tears heard at the remained that's still attached.
You nod your acknowledgement of Kethean.
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger leans forward, watching intently.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Wipe your hands, better grip."
Patek gives a spool of cloth to Wanderer Kethean.
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Patek ponders the situation.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Notice the jaw though?"
Patek gnaws intently on a locust-horn necklace.
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Not canid."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood reaches down and pries it open slightly.
Wanderer Kethean takes the cloth, wiping them off, and goes back for a second
try. This time his grasp remains true, and pulls the remainder of the face
off.
You say to Kethean, "Well done. Thanks."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil runs his claws over the teeth lightly.
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its an odd jaw, powerful. Obviously not
from a plant eater."
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But I can't place it exactly."
You purse your lips, deep in thought.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian strokes the skull shortly, taking a better idea of the
shape.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Maybe a kochlan."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Similar, somewhat."
Selthis nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It is."
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Have they been spotted in Llus then?"
Patek shakes his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "This one was in Caanae."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Llus has been quite free of invaders."
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "I then doubt it is a kochlan."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Slythera summoned it."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its not that it is a kochlan."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its made from assorted creatures."
You say, "Just part of it might be kochlan."
Hivarius ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."
Wanderer Kethean stands with a grunt, dropping the flesh to the ground with a
wet flop. He peers at the skull for the first time, and remarks, "Check out
that grin."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Likely chosen to cause the most pain."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Mainly the teeth - but then, many sharp teeth
are there...
Patek shrugs helplessly.
Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head towards the exposed teeth and
musculature, clicking quietly to himself, perceiving with suspicion.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I suppose it is of little concern."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But it seems an apt choice for misery."
You say, "What's important is that the head itself is not even from solely
one creature."
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Its brain?"
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "If one exists within, even."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Such a creature, perhaps, might even lack such.
What purpose would a mind have in such?"
You shake your head at Patek.
Patek tilts his head curiously at you.
You say, "Even demons have brains. They just can only comprehend destruction.
I suspect this has a brain of sorts."
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Although."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "This is a created creature."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It does little but serve the will of its
master."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "What use would it have for a brain?"
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
You say, "True."
You say, "Only one way to find out, eh?"
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Is the animation magickal, necromantic, or of
other nature?"
Patek ponders the situation.
You say to Patek, "Judging from the runes where it was summoned, I would say
basic necromancy."
You say to Patek, "The runes were primitive to modern Lorekeeper and Wytchen
runes and they were scrawled in blood."
Patek ponders the situation.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Still, that speaks of magickal nature."
Wanderer Kethean rubs his bloodied hands on the clean part of the cloth,
focusing on the skull. He holds the cloth out to Patek, "You be wantin' this
back?" he asks, still looking at the creature.
Patek gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Please."
Kethean gives a spool of cloth to Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood sets up his jigsaw near the creatures head and
begins to pump it, the blade making a loud whirring noise.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil leans over, sniffing at the smoke coming from the cut
in the bone.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Acrid."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Okay, now gently push the
skull into the jigsaw and hold it steady."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "But once you feel any give,
stop."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "We don't want destroy what
we're trying to examine."
Wanderer Kethean nods to Selthis, kneeling down again. He grasps hold of the
skull with one hand, and the saw with the other, pushing down firmly.
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger winces as fine bone particles fly all around.
Hivarius's ears prick up suddenly.
Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil tastes the air.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Good good."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The bone does not smell aged, particularly."
Hivarius sniffs the corpse of the Fleshreaver, trying to decipher just what
that smell emanating from him is.
Wanderer Kethean grimaces as he works, and then suddenly stops. "Therrit goes.
Better not move that saw anymore," he says.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Help him turn the body, that way we can
just pop off the whole top of his skull at once."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil hoists up the body beside Kethean.
Patek prods the corpse of the Fleshreaver in the chest.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Heavy thing."
Patek nudges Kethean with his smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Doing well."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Want me ta cut all the way 'round, then?"
Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Think of it as uncorking a bottle."
Selthis grins mischievously.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Although I'm not sure you'd want to
drink what he has to offer."
You give Selthis a wry, shifty smile.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil wraps his tail around the legs of the corpus for better
leverage.
Wanderer Kethean says, "The front might be a tad bit inta, sorry about that.
Pushin' too hard."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "We'll manage."
Wanderer Kethean carefully removes the saw from the skull. He places it beside
the head, and moves closer to try and flip the golem over.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil discreetly dips a claw into the gristle at the
creature's jaw, and licks his hand, considering the taste.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil hoists the corpse up a bit to assist.
Garmin raises an eyebrow at Patek.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Garmin, "Tastes like meat, simply."
Garmin nods his head.
Patek gags a few times then vomits his last meal all over the floor.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Ergh."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Well."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Perhaps not like... good meat."
Garmin gives a canteen of whiskey to Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil.
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "Calm your stomach.."
Patek creases his brow in a frown.
Patek shakes his head.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Garmin, "I can't, but thank you."
Garmin shrugs helplessly.
[-The following has been left intact in this log to show just how awesome Selthis is-
(Ring): Selthis says, "I should just totally fuck this up."
(Ring): You say, "Lol."
(Ring): Selthis says, "By emoting out violating the creature anally. :(."
(Ring): You say, "Please don't."
(Ring): Selthis says, "Oh god."
(Ring): Selthis says, "Can you imagine though."
(Ring): You say, "Haha."
(Ring): Selthis says, "It'd be like "hey this is cool" "oh fuck, trainwreck!"
in like two seconds flat."
(Ring): You say, "ROFL."
(Ring): You say, "Now stop talking on the ring and ruining my log :/."
-End of Selthis being special.-]
Wanderer Kethean grunts and heaves with Patek, sending the corpse rolling over.
He curses under his breath and catches the head before the roll is complete.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Don't wanna have the front gettin' messy."
Patek pats Kethean in a friendly manner.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Nicely done."
Wanderer Kethean grabs the saw again, and starts near the first cut, starting
from the edge of the cut.
Patek ponders the situation.
Wanderer Kethean clenches his teeth as he pumps his arm in long, smooth
strokes, sending the saw back and forth on the head, skin tearing above the
unexposed bone.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil holds the head steady against the sawing.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns towards the canid eyes in their sockets,
glistening succulently and considers.
Wanderer Kethean slows the saw down as it begins to bite into bone. The sawing
continues to steadily slow down, until he stops completely. He wipes some
sweat off his forehead with a forearm, and then moves to the back of the head.
Selthis gives Kethean an acknowledging nod.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Low on the skull, I think."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Nearly done."
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "It's certainly thick skulled.."
You snicker at Garmin.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Garmin, "Well it is a Demoner's
creation."
Garmin nods his head at Selthis, showing his acceptance.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Garmin, "They're molded after their
masters."
Selthis nods his head.
You smirk.
Garmin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Wanderer Kethean moves a bit faster now that he's got a fair judge on the
thickness of the skull, and in a few moments the top of the skull starts
bobbing loosely. Kethean grins, and palms the top of the head and begins
twisting carefully.
Patek nods his head.
Wanderer Kethean pulls the top clean off, a thick trail of slimey goo reluctant
to let go. He grins, looking around, holding the part of the skull. "Anyone
need a new helm't?" he says, and laughs.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks once, and turns his head upwards.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head upwards, chitters softly, and considers
the space above him.
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger smiles and says to Kethean, "..good clean cut."
Selthis snickers at Kethean.
Selthis nods his head.
You nod your acknowledgement of Kethean.
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood shoves a hand and feels around in the cavity of
the skull.
Patek tilts his head curiously at Selthis.
Selthis shakes his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Nothing."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Just this slime."
Garmin raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Nothing?"
Patek ponders the situation.
Selthis shakes his head.
You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.
You say, "Figures."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Nothing at all."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil sticks a claw into the slime, and sniffs at it.
Patek wrinkles his nose disfavourably.
Ignoring the world around you, you study the corpse of the Fleshreaver
intently.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Anything on the bottom of the
skull?"
Wanderer Kethean stands and moves a few steps back from the corpse.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian slices a small bit of slime with the tip of his glaive.
Hivarius wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
Hivarius licks a blade-tipped glaive.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Clean it out? Perhaps runes animate this...
thing's will."
You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "They may be inked within or without its skull,
if they are there."
You nod your acknowledgement of Patek.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood cups his hand and scoops the goo out onto a
drain channel on the floor.
You have emoted: Arcitens leans over the skull and sniffs inside, taking in the
disgusting scent of the slime.
You have emoted: Arcitens uses a paw to wipe the greenish slime from inside the
skull, exposing a blood-red rune embossed in the skull.
You say to Patek, "Good guess."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Does anyone recognize it?"
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
You say, "Not I."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil traces its contours, considering.
Wanderer Kethean examines the teeth on the saw in one hand, and the cut on the
half-skull in his other. He moves the half-skull over to his other elbow,
holding it between his body. He grabs the cloth and begins wiping down the
saw.
Garmin peers at the corpse of the Fleshreaver unscrupulously.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It looks vaguely similar to the one
sketched in Caanae, doesn't it?"
You nod your head affirmatively at Selthis.
You say, "But as I said, it is different from Lorekeeper and Wytchen runes."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But it could just be that all runes look
alike."
Selthis gives you a nod of acknowledgement.
You chuckle long and heartily.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Don't ask me, I can barely read common."
Kethean chuckles long and heartily.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It's not a rune I've perceived before."
Patek shrugs helplessly.
You say to Selthis, "The runes all have different symbols. And this looks
different from any I have seen."
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Well, clearly is what a demon is designed for ain't
it?"
Wanderer Kethean get's the saw semiclean, which is pretty good with an already
used cloth. He drapes the cloth on his shoulder and grasps the skull in his
hand again.
You say to Kethean, "Make a necklace out of it maybe."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or a hat, I'm sure the ladies would love
that."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The Wildgraf, perhaps."
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "A hat with a mark, somethin you would give to a
lady?"
Wanderer Kethean chuckles at everyone, and tosses the skull so it lands near
the body with a hollow sound. "Or maybe, Ah'll just leave it with it's
rightfull owner." He grins.
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The stench from it seems to increase over time.
Perhaps the wall-hides absorb the stench and magnify it."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or perhaps it seems to be decaying
faster."
Patek ponders the situation.
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Perhaps. The odor of decay is stronger."
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
You say, "I think it decays faster than natural creatures."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Anyway."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So we see the controlling link."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its obviously not a sentient creature."
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
You say, "Simply controlled by Slythera."
Selthis nods his head.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Nothing it was made from, at least from cursory
inspection."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "All seem non-sentient. Some bird, also some
ursus."
Selthis nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And you'll also notice the exposed ribs
on its body."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil pokes at the body.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Note the structure here? Poorly assembled, with
ribs sticking out so."
Patek grins mischievously at Selthis.
Patek nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "The creatures were obviously dead when
harvested from."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "My exact thought."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So its not as if some magick merged all
of them together while still living."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "My only hope is that that Krugtha fellow
isn't involved."
You say, "Which explains why it is decaying more quickly - it's already been
dead."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Still - fresh kills when it was assembled, I
think."
Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Agreed."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Or else the flesh would be sloughing off
before it even existed."
You say to Selthis, "Good point."
Patek nods his head.
Wanderer Kethean tilts his head as he watches. He absentmindedly pops his
knuckles.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "This state, though, doesn't seem to agree with
the component parts."
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, I suppose it is time to explore
the body cavity."
You pat Kethean in a friendly manner.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Slice above the ribs, perhaps?"
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
You ask, "Or down the middle?"
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Where is the middle on this, though..."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The lines are all wrong on it."
Patek ponders the situation.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah've gotta'n idea."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Here is what you do."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Cut below the ribs.
horizontally and at each flank cut down vertically. enough of the sternum is
exposed we can pry it open and crack 'em back."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "It'll save some time."
Selthis urges Kethean onwards.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah was juss plannin' on punching below the sternum and
prying the ribs back."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "True, but we need to expose the gut
too."
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "To see if it even has any sort of
digestive tract."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Selthis, "Was it observed eating?"
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah can't juss reach in and pull em out?"
Wanderer Kethean grins, moving over to the torso.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "That's a disembowelling, not
a dissection."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Patek, "And I have no clue."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I personally doubt it has any real
internal organs."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Could Ah get a dagger?"
You take a long, sharp dagger from a dark leather satchel.
You give a long, sharp dagger to Wanderer Kethean.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "If it doesn't have a brain, my guess it
has no guts."
Patek ponders the situation.
Patek nods his head.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "If it was made to kill, aye."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "And that seems likely, eh?"
You nod your head in agreement.
You say, "It's only purpose was to kill. It doesn't need the normal functions
of a living creature."
Selthis nods his head.
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But we must pursue the option anyway."
You nod your head in agreement.
Wanderer Kethean nods, taking the dagger, tossing it in the air and reversing
his grip when he catches it. He kneels down and leans over the chest.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "I am going for an even worse smell."
Hivarius sucks thoughtfully on a handsome gold link necklace.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Hivarius, "You're well on your way.."
Patek hums quietly to himself.
Hivarius narrows his eyes at Patek in an unnerving manner.
Hivarius shrinks from the implacable gaze of Patek.
Patek grins mischievously at Hivarius.
Wanderer Kethean considers the thickness of the flesh, then considers the
knife, and then just stabs the dagger in, stopping it about halfway in.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Now I think we better need to get the attention to
the demon, I'm gettin hungry staring at you."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks once, and turns his head upwards.
Hivarius licks his lips.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Kethean, "Pull back carefully - the guts should
be seen intact."
Selthis nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And Gods help us if it has a bowel and
you puncture it."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "You think it smells bad now."
You snicker softly to yourself.
"Ewwwwwwwww!" says Patek in disgust.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "You ain't seen nothing."
Wanderer Kethean bites his tongue as he begins saw-cutting the flesh open from
the hole right below the sternum. A vile ooze gushes out of the puncture.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "You might even faint."
Patek wrinkles his nose disfavourably.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Glad I ain't a Lyke sometimes."
"Meh," you mutter at Hivarius with a scowl.
Hivarius sticks his tongue out at you.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Lycaeans are fine."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The right garnish, and even better."
Patek nods sagely at himself.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "They got a better nose."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah'm pretty sure Ah didn't punch inta the organs..."
You say to Kethean, "Good. You're doing well."
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "Strange...I expected more blood. Perhaps
the creatures were drained first?"
You scratch your head looking for an idea.
Patek ponders the situation.
You say, "Or the blood is congealed already."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, if they're from dead creatures."
You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.
"Aye," Garmin mutters aloud.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "They would likely have no blood."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Given that the parts were taken from many
creatures, it makes sense that the blood would have drained, aye."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Usually, there's not allotta blud when yar openin' them
up like this anyway."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "But usually better, tastier smells..."
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says to Patek, "You cant have everything."
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Hivarius, "That's what they tell you,
but its bullshit."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Hivarius, "It all depends on how bad
you want it."
Patek gnaws intently on a dried, dead flower.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says to Selthis, "Dont get me started."
Wanderer Kethean slips his free hand into the new gash he created, feeling
around for the other edge. He finds it and lifts the flesh up, the cut
becoming cleaner with the new space. He cuts the horizontal cut right below
the sternum, and starts a line down the flanks, lifting the large slap of skin
as he goes.
Wanderer Kethean cuts the other flank down, gets a better hold of the flap, and
opens the body up like a book, tossing the "cover" of flesh onto the groin,
exposing the innards.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Well, there ya have it."
Patek ponders the situation.
Selthis scratches his head in confusion.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil leans over the cavity, chitin twitching furiously
around his nasal passages.
Patek looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger leans forward, peering into the void of the
creature's chest.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I..."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Don't see anything."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Not even much of that slime."
Selthis scratches his head in confusion.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Which is to be expected I suppose."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Truly a thing of limited purpose."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But you'd think the cavity would be full
of the slime."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Like the skull."
Patek ponders the situation.
You purse your lips, deep in thought.
You ask, "Maybe the slime was a sort of primitive brain?"
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The slime - it did not smell like spoiled meat."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Something added?"
You shrug helplessly.
Wanderer Kethean stands, wiping some of the slime off his face with a forearm.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It is likely something added."
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian puts his head inside the body for the moment.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Think you can yell in it for an echo."
Hivarius mutters discontentedly.
You chuckle long and heartily at Hivarius.
Garmin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Reach up there into the chest
and feel around."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Tell us if you feel anything?
I figure not."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But eh."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Cracking the chest won't really be
necessary if there's nothing to see."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Hrm... some demons spit a slime which smells
similar. Did this thing spit?"
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Not that i recall."
Patek gnaws intently on a rough hide.
Wanderer Kethean spits off to the side, the smell getting to him for a sec. He
wipes the dagger clean, toss-flipping it again and catching the blade, holding
it up. "Ah can't remember who handed me this...".
You say to Kethean, "I did."
Kethean gives a long, sharp dagger to you.
You nod your acknowledgement of Kethean.
You lick a long, sharp dagger.
You say, "Doesn't taste like the skull did either."
You put a long, sharp dagger into a dark leather satchel.
You scratch your head looking for an idea.
You ask Selthis, "So what now?"
Wanderer Kethean moves back to the corpse, kneeling by it. He leans down,
sliding his hand up the chest cavity.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to you, "Now we examine a few parts that
are attached to each other."
Wanderer Kethean reaches in shoulder-deep. He raises his eyebrow, feeling
around.
The corpse settles slightly, the cutting and prodding taking its toll on its
structural integrity.
Patek ponders the situation.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It seems to be decaying with some speed."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It does."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Anything?"
Wanderer Kethean curses as he shifts with the corpse. He braces himself with
his free hand and pulls out a slime covered arm. "Lov'ly," he says, as he
examines the ooze.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "We've got a spring, you can
clean up there afterwards."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And then we'll get a drink in you."
Kethean chuckles long and heartily.
You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil pokes one of the limbs, noting its near detachment from
the trunk.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It truly seems to be near falling apart."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "It was stronger, more... coherent, when I first
arrived."
Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah think Ah've got an idea about this slime..."
Selthis tilts his head and listens intently to Kethean.
"Oh?" Garmin exclaims quizzically.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Interestin'ly enuff, when Ah was reachin around inside,
there wasn't much slime."
Selthis nods his head.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Then the bugger started fallin' 'part. It released more
of this stuff."
Patek ponders the situation.
You purse your lips, deep in thought.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Like the skin is made of slime?"
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "Or absorbed it somehow..?"
Wanderer Kethean shakes his arm off to the side, sending the ooze flying.
"More like we found it's lifeblud." He shrugs.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, that is what I was thinking too."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "A lot of demons have the same sort of
fluid in them. I've noticed it before when I killed them."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And Patek pointed it out as well."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Try cuttin' open the arms an' legs, see if more of the
stuff seeps out."
You say, "So that slime subsitutes for its brain, its blood, and its organs all
in one."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, what if that slime came from a
demon?"
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I mean, its already a creation of
various parts."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Like the slimes a noctusari can summon to them?"
Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
Patek ponders the situation.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Who is to say that it doesn't get it
fuel from something else."
Garmin tilts his head and listens intently.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil scoops up a small bit of the slime into a birchwood
vial, and caps it carefully.
Selthis gives Patek an acknowledging nod.
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger says to Patek, "Good idea."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil lights a punk with his tinderbox, and melts a bit of
wax around the edge of the vial's cap.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Can't be too sure."
Wanderer Kethean grimaces, wiping the more stubborn ooze on his tunic.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Its fine until it starts
dissolving your flesh."
You give a mischievous grin.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Then comes the screaming..."
Selthis nods his head.
Patek nods sagely at himself.
Garmin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Lots and lots of screaming."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But anyway."
Wanderer Kethean says, "An' then you buy me more then one drink, Ah'm thinkin'"
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Another drink for every digit that comes
up missing."
Patek grins mischievously.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "3 per limb."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its the standard rate."
Wanderer Kethean rubs his chin in though, and shrugs.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "And you would have the honour to drink it all."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "The only question that remains for me is
this."
You tilt your head and listen intently to Selthis.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Its obvious how it is attached
externally."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "You can see the remnants of the
stitching."
Patek ponders the situation.
Garmin nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "But how is it done internally that
allows movement."
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Held together with magick?"
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "For example."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "This arm is obviously from a monkey or
something."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And its hooked into what appears to be a
bear's shoulder socket."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil tugs at the stitching material, considering.
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The stitching appears to be sinew, ripped from
some living thing."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil tugs a bit of stitching free, and gnaws at it briefly.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "This bit tastes of cat."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Brothers, Ah think the thing was grown tagether."
You tilt your head curiously at Kethean.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Muscle just does not attach to foreign
muscle though."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "If I cut of Arcitens' arm and then
Hivarius', and switched tehm."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "They'd just rot."
Kethean chuckles long and heartily.
"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Selthis, "That could be tested...."
Patek hums quietly to himself.
You give Patek the once-over, eyeing him suspiciously.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to you, "If you lost an arm only, of course."
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says to Patek, "We could try yours and Garmin's rather."
Garmin peers at Hivarius unscrupulously.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says to Selthis, "I with an elf's arm, and he with an
Akrabi's.... an odd pair we'd make."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Patek, "You could do a road show in
Antioch."
Garmin grins mischievously at Selthis.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Would be fun if it worked."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Patek, "I'm sure they'd love it."
"Ewwwwwwwww!" says Patek in disgust.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "I'll pass, I think."
You say, "Back to the matter at hand, men."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "The arm doesn't just grow into the stump
of the old."
You say to Selthis, "Well then Kethean's suggestion makes sense."
Wanderer Kethean spits off to the side again.
Selthis nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It does."
You say, "If different parts of different creatures were taken and then grown
into a new creature, then when that new creature is born it would function
close to if it were naturally that way."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "In a way."
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The heat would make it rot faster, if nothing
else."
Patek wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "It was probably done via magick."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah think it's pretty safe ta say it was magick... An'
if it matters, the ooze that began fillin' it up was pretty warm."
Hivarius nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "That is all I can figure."
You nod your head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Becuase sadly, normal animals do not
suffer adding appendages from other animals well."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Though I know some trees do."
You nod your head at Selthis, showing your acceptance.
Patek smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Patek nods his head.
You say, "There's another avenue we haven't explored."
Selthis tilts his head and listens intently to you.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "What would that be?"
You say, "We don't know where this thing was born or grown or whathaveyou."
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Stavenn would have been an option."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "A pit... such things, pits. Always seems to be
pits involved. Mind you, just a guess."
Garmin smirks.
You nod your acknowledgement of Patek.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Well, she summoned it."
You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.
You say, "If it was created in the demonic realm, for example..."
You say, "I would venture to guess that the animals were taken from our realm,
reassembled unnaturally elsewhere, and summoned back here through those runes."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "So my guess in the invader's homeland or
in the demon realm."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "She seemed to be the sort that would be
at home in either."
You say, "Precisely."
You say, "And she does seem to have seem to be a demonologist of sorts."
Selthis nods his head.
With a barely audible 'plop' the flesh of the creature's left hand sloughs off
from the body and falls to the floor
Selthis peers about himself unscrupulously.
You blink.
Garmin puts his hands on his hips and goes "Hmmm!"
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil toes the goo on the floor about.
Hivarius Arda'Tsian says, "Well, there goes the creature."
Hivarius gives a pained sigh.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood pokes the thigh of the creature, his fingertip
piercing the weakening flesh.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil grasps a limb, and squeezes - and the limb separates
easily.
Patek ponders the situation.
You purse your lips, deep in thought.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "If only they were all like this, all the time.
They wouldn't be a threat."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "I wonder if she was the one keeping it
structurally sound."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Sort of a one use thing, then when she
didn't need it, she just release it and it would disappear on its own?"
Patek ponders the situation.
Patek nods his head.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "So it seems."
More of the flesh of the arm seems to begin to run down the side of the slab.
Selthis creases his brow in a frown.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "This is going to be a mess."
Patek wrinkles his nose disfavourably.
Patek prods the corpse of the Fleshreaver in the chest.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Now wouldnit be a bugger...."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "Guess what you gotta do
before you get your free drinks?"
"Heh heh heh," you chuckle at Selthis.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Very little to it retains integrity."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Ah figured as much."
Patek pokes in the empty air.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Nothing left to it, really."
The corpse jiggles wildly for a moment, before splitting and liquifying, most
of it running into several channels on the floor.
Selthis peers about himself unscrupulously.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Okay."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "That was nasty."
You say, "To be expected though."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Remind me to lay down a drip cloth or
something next time."
You chuckle long and heartily.
Garmin grins mischievously.
You say, "Will do, Fury."
Wanderer Kethean says, "Saw that comin', too."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Well, a bit late..."
Patek pokes at a rough hide.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Kethean, "You did good boy."
Selthis reaches over and gives Kethean a friendly noogie.
You nod your head in agreement.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And don't worry, it's the clean hand."
Wanderer Kethean says, "No matter, Ah'm filthy an'way."
Patek nods sagely at Kethean.
You say to Kethean, "I can show you where our spring is if you wanna wash up."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "C'mon, lets go get washed up and we'll
go spend some time at the Tavern."
You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.
You say, "Sounds good."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "The tavern, hrm."
You say to Patek, "There's cider there too."
Patek nods his head.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says to Patek, "Pesky Illuminai."
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil clicks once, and turns his head upwards.
You nod your head in agreement.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil says, "Meet you there, then."
Selthis nods his head.
Cannibal Patek Qaqyesil turns his head in all directions quickly, taking in the
area.
You beckon to Kethean.
Wanderer Kethean says, "Now, Ah've got somethin' pickin' me brain...."
Garmin raises an eyebrow at Kethean.
Wanderer Kethean says, "That ooze... If it is lifeblud... Can it make another
one?"
You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "The bones seemed to lose their bonds
when the flesh fell apart."
You say to Kethean, "Doubtful, but just to be safe..."
You have emoted: Arcitens grabs a bit of the what's left of the skull of the
floor. He puts a paw inside it and rubs over the red rune repeatedly, until it
finally smudges away.
You say to Kethean, "I doubt it could be revived now."
Selthis nods his head.
Kethean nods his head.
You say to Kethean, "Follow me lad."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Worse comes to worse, we'll take the
bones to my campground and burn 'em."
Selthis looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
You nod your acknowledgement of Selthis.
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Not a bad idea actually."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood gathers up most of the bones.
Wanderer Kethean says, "I juss hope no one tosses some corpses on the
remainders, and a new one grows up."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "Someone else grab the rest."
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger says, "That'd suggest we were right, they
weren't physically joined."
You say, "I think Slythera's lost her interest."
Selthis, Fury of the Black Wood says, "And I'll meet you at the Junction."
Selthis lowers his head and closes his eyes, as though trying to rememeber
something.
You say to Selthis, "Will do."
Selthis snaps his head up suddenly and quickly darts off.
Kethean begins to follow you.
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger rubs his hands together.
You say to Garmin, "Mind grabbing the bones while I take Kethean to wash up?"
Garmin enthuses, "Sure!"
You nod your acknowledgement of Garmin.
Garmin Arda'Tsian, Elven Ranger gathers together the remnants of bone from the
stone floor.
You nod your head.
You say, "See you back at the Tavern."
Kethean follows you to the east.
In a cold and overgrown courtyard. (Warden Guildhall.)
A wooden trebuchet is here, waiting to be fired.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, and up.
Kethean follows you to the north.
At the fireside. (Warden Guildhall.)
A great skull, crowned by horns and bristling with teeth, hangs from the wall
here.
You see a single exit leading south and down (hidden).
