You enter a fiery portal.
Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. Waving ominously, a black
flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles listlessly in the wind. An 
ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally decorated pedestal here. The 
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, 
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. A black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold, at full 
mast upon a narrow pole has been implanted here. There are 27 Diavlous Knights 
here. A Kenuba hippopotamus stands here, massive jaws agape. A black 
star-shaped vial has been left here. A small black cobra is flaring its hood 
here. There are 2 powerful buckskin stallions here. A magnificent flag, 
emblazoned with the crest of the Empire ripples regally from the columns of the
gates. There are 2 armoured battle stallions here. A bench made from old, 
overly used weapons and armour has been placed here. There are 16 elegantly 
dressed Noctusaris here. An elegantly dressed Noctusari is manning a cannon 
here. He has fifty-seven cannon balls. A short, stone basin rests upon a 
pedestal here filled with blood. A tengu hovers gently over the ground here. A 
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Mangled and 
bloodied fur is all that remains of a small red-backed vole. Balanced easily on
its oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings 
with its huge, blue eyes. Floating in the air is a fiery portal. Saryum is 
sitting on a bench of old weapons and armour. Felreign Trez Blackmoor, the 
Brute of Blackthorne is riding on a black ouroboros. He is holding a tower 
shield in his right hand. Soul&#39;s Claw, Rayyn Andarial is riding on a black 
ouroboros. She wields a Sukhder daegger in her left hand and a tower shield in 
her right. The undead form of Advisor Alaia Andarial, the Princess of 
Malevolence is here. She is holding a chain wrapped tower shield in her left 
hand.

Imperial Parade nearing the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A rune
circle has been sketched into the ground here. A large, gold flecked hawk 
hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the light. The 
undead remains of a fearsome lion is here. Smoky tendrils constantly twisting 
and weaving around a towering demon statue, a shadow servant is here. A kohdon 
scout stands here eyeing his surroundings with an impassionated stare. The 
mighty war gong of Stavenn looms here, hanging between two pillars of fused 
bone. The visage of a horrific demon carved in bloodstone rises up from a base 
of skulls and stone. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at 
you with its many eyes. Anointed with blood, a heinous demonic jackal crouches 
here baring gleaming teeth. A slow oozing of blood runs the length of this 
black cross. The undead remains of a pallid stallion is here. A Diavlous Knight
is manning a bolt thrower here. He has ninety-five bolts. Advancing with teeth 
bared, the wolverine objects to the intrusion. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A sleek black hound stands stone still, 
ears perked and alert. An Imperial page is here, a small kit tucked securely

around chasing its tail. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive 
woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. A wooden torch is 
here, ready to be lit. A glossy silril sits peacefully here, a tiny sparkle 
atop her head. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here,

with its huge, blue eyes. Floating in the air is a fiery portal. Saryum is
sitting on a bench of old weapons and armour. Felreign Trez Blackmoor, the
