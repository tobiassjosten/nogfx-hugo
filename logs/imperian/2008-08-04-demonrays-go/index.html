Forge of the Lion. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A plain metal desk rests upon the ground 
here. An enormous, ancient frost grizzly looms over his surroundings here, his 
hoary fur ragged with old scars. A lithe desert fox slinks cunningly nearby. A 
slender monkey with white fur is here chattering loudly. A fearsome lion prowls
around here and greets you with a warning roar. A thorny lizard is here, 
hissing menacingly and moving slowly around the room. A sharp-clawed caracal 
prowls about here. A tiny cactus wren flutters about the room. Hunched over 
himself a brooding vulture snaps at anything in reach. Curling up into an 
armored ball, a long-nosed armadillo tumbles here. Pacing around the room a 
brown striped hyena casts a wary eye. There are 2 wolfish hounds here. There 
are 2 Seraphic guardians here. There are 2 savage grey wolves here. Its long, 
smooth tail curled around its legs, an exotic canine sits here peacefully. A 
noble falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding you watchfully. Eyes 
glinting with bloodlust, an arctic wolf prowls here. Sniffing at the wind 
curiously, a small white fox pauses here. Tiny nose twitching, a sleek ermine 
scampers about here. Huge eyes blinking sleepily at you, a snowy owl roosts 
here. Massive and immovable as an iceberg, a tundra bear stands proudly here. 
Fluttering about and calling raucously, an arctic tern hovers in the air here. 
Elder Youngling, Silmeria Vollice Viantha Vjorn is here. Tiala Acerbus is here.
She wields a sleek javelin in her left hand and a tower shield in her right.

right. Blackguard Anarion Reopev is here. He wields a truesilver glaive in his 
left hand and a tower shield in his right. Mistress Takas, Paran Educator is 
here. Trainee Thorik is here. He wields a magebreaker battleaxe in each hand. 
Zexo is riding on an armoured battle stallion. He wields a truesilver sabre in 
each hand. Honor&#39;s Arbitrator, Perynelle Ashtear, Healing Apprentice is here. 
She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a spiritual mace in her right. 
Silken Pae&#39;ganis is here, cloaked by a swirling white mist. Seraphic Pride, 
Tallasar Kith&#39;Vahni is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a 
dwarven battleaxe in his right. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES 
is the command to see what is for sale.
