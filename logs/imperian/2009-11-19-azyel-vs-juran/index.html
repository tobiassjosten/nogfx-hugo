You sing, "Yoth."
Your action causes the shimmering translucent shield around you to fade away.
Panicking, Juran clutches at his throat.
&lt;418/418h 432/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;h> &lt;bd>>
Juran's eyes close suddenly as he falls asleep.
&lt;418/418h 432/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;h> &lt;bd>>
You may eat another herb or plant.
&lt;418/418h 432/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
Juran awakens with a start.
&lt;418/418h 432/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
Your third eye defence has been stripped by Juran's holy seraph. (third eye)
&lt;418/418h 432/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>> (thirdeye)
Juran springs up from the ground to his feet.
&lt;418/418h 432/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
You now possess the gift of the third eye. (third eye)
&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>

&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
A nearly perfect sketch of a large spider suddenly scurries towards Juran and
bites him. An expression of pain crosses his's face.
&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2259w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
A stunning songbird begins to sing a trilling song to you.
The dancing melody of the Song of Restoration rings in your ears as some of
your willpower is replenished.
&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2263w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>> sing kantae juran
You sing, "Kantae."
You must regain your equilibrium first.
&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2263w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
You may eat another toadstool.
&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2263w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
You have regained your mental equilibrium.
&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2263w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>> sing kantae juran
You must wait a short while to use a say-like command again.
&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2263w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Your nightsight defence has been stripped by Juran's holy seraph. (nightsight)
&lt;418/418h 430/472m 1781e 2263w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>> sing kantae juran
You may drink another healing elixir.
You sing, "Kantae."
Holding your mouth open wide, you force the word of power from your being,
sustaining the single note.
&lt;418/418h 421/472m 1781e 2261w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
A nearly perfect sketch of a large spider leaps towards Juran, sinking his
fangs into Juran's skin.
&lt;418/418h 421/472m 1781e 2261w 92x &lt;-bpp> &lt;bd>>
The lilting melody of a rousing song swells briefly around Juran.
==================YOTH NEEDED==================

You have regained your mental equilibrium.
&lt;418/418h 421/472m 1781e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>

&lt;418/418h 421/472m 1781e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
A nearly perfect sketch of a large spider leaps towards Juran, sinking his
fangs into Juran's skin.
&lt;418/418h 417/472m 1781e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Your desire for life fades as your past failures return to haunt you.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1781e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
A look of extreme focus crosses the face of Juran.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1781e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You project the word of power to the listening ears of Juran.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1782e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juran is quickly enveloped in sticky webbing as a nearly perfect sketch of a
large spider deftly spins a web.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1782e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juran quickly eats some hyssop stem.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1782e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juran's Seraphic guardian's eyes glow menacingly at you.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1782e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juran takes a drink from a cylindrical sinn vial.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1782e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juran quickly eats a toadstool.

Adelinda has been slain by misadventure.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1782e 2261w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
A nearly perfect sketch of a large spider suddenly scurries towards Juran and
bites him. An expression of pain crosses his's face.
&lt;418/418h 378/472m 1783e 2262w 92x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You cut off your emanation of the word of power.
A beatific look of bliss appears on Juran's face as his ears begin to harden
and turn to pure marble. The marble quickly spreads over his face and down his
neck, turning his entire form white. After his entire body has been completely
transformed, a fine skein of thin flame wreathes over the chest of the statue,
imprinting a short passage onto it.
You have slain Juran.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 2 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b4b892a8dbbe284a30a0f28170346f6?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by motrax@xxx on 21Â Nov 2009</p><p>Right, because winning as a Bard takes both skill and requires you to laugh at your opponent.</p><p>You&rsquo;re still an idiot, Azyel.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx on 21Â Nov 2009</p><p>What&rsquo;s the point of this log?
