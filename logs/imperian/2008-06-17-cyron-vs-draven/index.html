Aryana&#39;s Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a 
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved 
statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a 
pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist 
lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting 
a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble 
statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, 
the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved 
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his
heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth.
A comfortable leather sofa sits here. A small sign points into a market stall. 
A spirited Shaahri stallion trots about. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. His eyes dulled from constant fear, a muamrite 
slave wanders aimlessly. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse
stands here imperially. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and
alert. A feral demon has been slain and left here to rot. A stray cat wanders 
around here, searching the ground for food. The undead remains of a large 
spider is here. Trainee Aska is here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each 
hand. Incinerate Draven Acerbus, Messenger of &#39;Ab is here, sprawled on the 
ground.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved
statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a
pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist
lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting
a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble
statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal,
the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his
heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth.
A comfortable leather sofa sits here. A small sign points into a market stall.
A spirited Shaahri stallion trots about. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his
gaze cast over the Springs. His eyes dulled from constant fear, a muamrite
slave wanders aimlessly. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse
stands here imperially. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and
alert. A feral demon has been slain and left here to rot. A stray cat wanders
around here, searching the ground for food. The undead remains of a large
spider is here. Trainee Aska is here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each
hand. Incinerate Draven Acerbus, Messenger of 'Ab is here, sprawled on the
ground.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway
leads down.

Aryana's Spring.
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved
statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a
pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist
lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting
a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble
statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal,
the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his
heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth.
A comfortable leather sofa sits here. A small sign points into a market stall.
A spirited Shaahri stallion trots about. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his
gaze cast over the Springs. His eyes dulled from constant fear, a muamrite
slave wanders aimlessly. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse
stands here imperially. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and
alert. A feral demon has been slain and left here to rot. Trainee Aska is here.
He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each hand. Incinerate Draven Acerbus,
Messenger of 'Ab is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway
