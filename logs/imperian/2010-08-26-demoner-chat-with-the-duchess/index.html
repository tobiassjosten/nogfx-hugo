You tell Insinyan Virs, The Vengeant Eye, "Magicker, Why is a non-combatant Stavennite being hunted by your kind?"

You tell Insinyan Virs, The Vengeant Eye, "Your Duchess is less than responsive, so I assume she is busy selling herself in your Inn, so I&#39;m asking you instead."

Insinyan tells you, "Awsome."

Insinyan tells you, "Let the young ones take care of it."

You tell Insinyan Virs, The Vengeant Eye, "Mmm, This one in particular that I&#39;m having to hear whine has been slain multiple times by your sandrat reject."

Insinyan tells you, "Multiple times? suggest they issue."

Kinuma tells you, "Whom is it that&#39;s being hunted and by wholm?"

You tell Graceful Rhapsody Kinuma, "I&#39;ve discussed this already with Insinyan since you&#39;re ability to reply is delayed to a point that I was unable to figure out if you were busy pleasuring yourself or if you were pretending I didn&#39;t exist."

You tell Graceful Rhapsody Kinuma, "However, Inform Justus that if he does continue to harass my young ones, I will besiege your entire city, again."

Kinuma tells you, "Who has he been killing?"

You tell Graceful Rhapsody Kinuma, "Mihochi is the one that I have spoken with. Traze I would go to say is a non-combatant merely because he is lower ranked and doesn&#39;t know how to defend himself. But I am unsure on his status."

Kinuma tells you, "Alright. Thank you for informing me."

You tell Graceful Rhapsody Kinuma, "If this continues, I come for your blood, Duchess."'>You tell Graceful Rhapsody Kinuma, "Magicker, Why is a non-combatant Stavennite being hunted by your ignorant kind?"
