It would tickle me to death if someone could figure out why he is attacking me, it has been several other reports that has come to my attention about him killing people without cause. This is very aggrovating that i work hard for what i do, and the experience i gain to all be screwed up by drongon, and his friends, i ALWAYS fight alone and here comes 3 or 4 of them to kill me. I would gladly duel EVERY single one of them solo, but i really want to know why he is still attacking me.&#34;he came into my home and started attacking when i had never talked to him before nor seen him.
