Tunnel underneath the arena. (road).
A few decaying pieces of metal and other parts of furniture indicate that this 
was once a staging room for the battles that once occurred on the main grounds 
of the arena. Time has taken its toll on this room, just like the rest of the 
ruins, as everything is in advanced states of decrepitude. A doorway to the 
north is partially blocked by a rotting door, held together only by the steel 
bands that used to strengthen it. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. A sleek black
hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A large wall of stone stands 
here, blocking passage to the north.
You see exits leading north and up.

The sweet scent of calla lilies flows about the room.

You must regain balance first.
You hear the voice from nowhere in your head, "DIE."
&lt; 400/414h 322/343m > [e-][db]
You tumble out of the room.
[ALERT:] Tumbled! Lost Cloak!
Tunnel underneath the arena. (road).
A few decaying pieces of metal and other parts of furniture indicate that this
was once a staging room for the battles that once occurred on the main grounds
of the arena. Time has taken its toll on this room, just like the rest of the
ruins, as everything is in advanced states of decrepitude. A doorway to the
north is partially blocked by a rotting door, held together only by the steel
bands that used to strengthen it. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. A sleek black
hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A large wall of stone stands
here, blocking passage to the north.
You see exits leading north and up.
