Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles 
listlessly in the wind. There are 12 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. The 
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, 
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. There are 5 Diavlous Knights here. There are 2 monolith 
sigils here. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with the crest of the Empire 
ripples regally from the columns of the gates. His hard eyes watching 
everything, a Stavennite constable patrols here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a
cannon here. He has ninety-one cannon balls. A roan mustang is here, its long, 
full mane flowing freely in the wind. A black and white cow wanders around 
here, minding its own business and paying you no attention. A sallow mare 
stands here idly. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. An ancient and 
oversized tome stands upon a regally decorated pedestal here. A small skull 
lays here on the ground. Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the 
Modin Valley stands here impassively. The decapitated head of Terri has been 
carelessly tossed aside.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east 
(gate open).

Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles
listlessly in the wind. There are 12 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. The
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid,
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. There are 5 Diavlous Knights here. There are 2 monolith
sigils here. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with the crest of the Empire
ripples regally from the columns of the gates. His hard eyes watching
everything, a Stavennite constable patrols here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a
cannon here. He has ninety-one cannon balls. A roan mustang is here, its long,
full mane flowing freely in the wind. A black and white cow wanders around
here, minding its own business and paying you no attention. A sallow mare
stands here idly. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. An ancient and
oversized tome stands upon a regally decorated pedestal here. A small skull
lays here on the ground. Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the
Modin Valley stands here impassively. The decapitated head of Terri has been
carelessly tossed aside.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east
(gate open).
