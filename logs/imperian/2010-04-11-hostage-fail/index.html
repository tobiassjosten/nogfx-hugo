The world is a slate of white, heavy snow. A graceful birch tree grows up from 
the ground here, armoured with cracked and scaly bark. Humming to himself, 
Hufort stands here whittling a piece of wood as he leans against a tree. Tryon 
Swiftpaw is here. He wields a sharpened quarterstaff in his hands.
You see exits leading north, south, and in.
Hufort, the woodsman glances up from his whittling briefly to note your 
presence.
Hufort, the woodsman says, "How ya doin&#39;?"
<386/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> (Done.) 
Tryon Swiftpaw says, "Just but you wanted me to kill her dog!"
Hufort, the woodsman exclaims, "I like dogs alright, but that little rat dog 
that Geselle has is annoyin&#39;!"
Hufort, the woodsman winks at Tryon and says, "If something...bad happened to 
the little rat I wouldn&#39;t shed a tear. Know what I mean?"
Hufort, the woodsman slaps his thighs and guffaws like an old man.
<386/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> take tryon hostage

Your aggressive action causes your mask to fall away.
You slowly make your away around behind Tryon, far enough away to remain 
inconspicuous.
Balance Taken: 4.00s
<386/386h 293/293m 1808e 1365w <e-> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Tryon dextrously whirls his staff in a tight circle.
You are suddenly revealed!
<386/386h 293/293m 1809e 1365w <e-> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
You have recovered balance.
<386/386h 293/293m 1808e 1365w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
As you approach Tryon&#39;s back, you quietly draw your knife to the ready, holding
it low and out of sight.
<386/386h 293/293m 1809e 1365w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
With one last, silent step, you find yourself directly behind Tryon and prepare
yourself for the pounce.
<386/386h 293/293m 1809e 1365w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Tryon takes a deep breath and a faint frosty vapour escapes from his nostrils.
<386/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Tryon opens his maw and exhales a blast of frigidly cold air on you. (chills)

<386/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
A flick of the wrist, a flash of your blade, and you take Tryon hostage with 
your knife to his throat.
<386/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> execute hostage

You swiftly drag the edge of your knife across Tryon&#39;s throat, splitting flesh 
and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to flow from the horrible 
wound in his neck as he topples to the ground, turning around to give you a 
look of despair as the light slowly fades from his eyes.
