Climbing the mesa. (Booming Dunes.) (13834)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. With pebbles and sand slipping under your feet, you work your way upward toward a flat-topped hill above. Fans of rubble ring the hill, making climbing possible, if slow. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The decaying remains of Ramsus lie here. A lovage leaf has been dropped here. There are 7 orphine seeds in 7 groups here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Seraphic Pride, Leoven E'Alcora is riding on a tranquil white mare. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana. Thema Edocar, Shou Tethe'alla, Herald of Salvation is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand. Jaivanna Ravenstehl is here, camouflaged. She wields a blood-stained javelin of bone in her left hand and a truesilver shield in her right.

Climbing the mesa. (Booming Dunes.) (13834)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A lovage leaf has been dropped here. There are 7 orphine seeds in 7 groups here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. Ramsus Shinpachi is here, hidden. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand. Thema Edocar, Shou Tethe'alla, Herald of Salvation is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana. Jaivanna Ravenstehl is here, camouflaged. She wields a blood-stained javelin of bone in her left hand and a truesilver shield in her right. Seraphic Pride, Leoven E'Alcora is riding on a tranquil white mare. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right.

Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. Seraphic Pride, Leoven E'Alcora is riding on a tranquil white mare. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right.
You see exits leading up and down.

Tracks in the sand. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Your eye is alerted to the presence of a sand-hued snake, barely perceptible amid the desert floor. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes.

Tracks in the sand. (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Jaivanna Ravenstehl is here, camouflaged. She wields a blood-stained javelin of bone in her left hand and a truesilver shield in her right. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. 
You see exits leading southwest, northwest, and up.

Tracks in the sand. (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A grunting musk hog roots in the sand, giving off a vile stink. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana. Jaivanna Ravenstehl is here, camouflaged. She wields a blood-stained javelin of bone in her left hand and a truesilver shield in her right. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.

Tracks in the sand. (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The decaying remains of Jaivanna lie here. A bit of laurel bark lies here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A grunting musk hog roots in the sand, giving off a vile stink. Thema Edocar, Shou Tethe'alla, Herald of Salvation is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand.
You see exits leading southwest, northwest, and up.

Climbing the mesa. (Booming Dunes.) (13834)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. With pebbles and sand slipping under your feet, you work your way upward toward a flat-topped hill above. Fans of rubble ring the hill, making climbing possible, if slow. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A lovage leaf has been dropped here. There are 7 orphine seeds in 7 groups here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to the ground. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his surroundings. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Komatata Anar-Alurl, Seraphic Pride is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana.

Tracks in the sand. (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The decaying remains of Jaivanna lie here. A bit of laurel bark lies here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A grunting musk hog roots in the sand, giving off a vile stink. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Ramsus Shinpachi is here, hidden. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana. Thema Edocar, Shou Tethe'alla, Herald of Salvation is here, hidden. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here.

Climbing the mesa. (Booming Dunes.) (13834)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A lovage leaf has been dropped here. There are 7 orphine seeds in 7 groups here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to the ground. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you.

A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. A large rattlesnake lies sleepily coiled nearby, its length wrapped about itself many times. Kazim lies slain, silent at last, his blood seeping into the sand. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his surroundings. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Komatata Anar-Alurl, Seraphic Pride is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Nathuel is here, hidden. He wields an ivory sitara in his right hand.

The mesa's foot. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (13839)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The great mesa towers above your head, casting all around you into shadow. The shade is a cool relief after the heat above, although the wind still blows fiercely. The dunes rise immediately from the base of the mesa, making all directions but the one from which you entered impassable. A resplendent gardenia bush is elegantly set into a polished silver basin, lending a graceful beauty to the area. A tiny dragonfly, wrought in silver and rose quartz is positioned just above a fragrant white bloom. A weak and weary desert traveler is here, recovering in the shade of the mesa. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana.

On the southern rim of the mesa. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (13837)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. With an edge so sudden it could have been cut with a knife, the mesa ends here. Occasional clatterings mark the slow crumbling of the mesa's lip, as small stones break lose and roll down the steep sides to the desert floor below. To one side, a rocky slope protrudes from the side of the mesa and slopes downward, making a narrow and treacherous path of sorts. Your eye is alerted to the presence of a sand-hued snake, barely perceptible amid the desert floor. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana.

Tracks in the sand. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A bit of laurel bark lies here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. The crushed translucent body of a bloodworm lies here in a pool of blood. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here. Ramsus Shinpachi is here, hidden. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand. Thema Edocar, Shou Tethe'alla, Herald of Salvation is here, hidden. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand.

On the hardpan. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (12278)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. This wide area of rolling ground between the larger dunes is both majestic and bleak. The ground consists of hard packed soil covered with coarse rocks and gravels. Amazingly, plant life is thriving here, taking many bizarre forms as the flora struggles to survive without water. Many-limbed cacti tower above you, the upright &#34;arms&#34; making them look like caricatures of startled mortals. Among these great cacti, green-skinned trees cling close to the ground, rarely rising over your head. There are many holes in the taller cacti, suggesting that birds use them for nesting. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, south, and west.

Climbing the mesa. (Booming Dunes.) (13834)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. With pebbles and sand slipping under your feet, you work your way upward toward a flat-topped hill above. Fans of rubble ring the hill, making climbing possible, if slow. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The decaying remains of Ramsus lie here. A lovage leaf has been dropped here. There are 7 orphine seeds in 7 groups here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Seraphic Pride, Leoven E'Alcora is riding on a tranquil white mare. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana. Thema Edocar, Shou Tethe'alla, Herald of Salvation is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand. Jaivanna Ravenstehl is here, camouflaged. She wields a blood-stained javelin of bone in her left hand and a truesilver shield in her right.

A lovage leaf has been dropped here. There are 7 orphine seeds in 7 groups here. A maidenhair leaf lies here.

The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to the ground. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. Seraphic Pride, Leoven E'Alcora is riding on a tranquil white mare.

Tracks in the sand. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Your eye is alerted to the presence of a sand-hued snake, barely perceptible amid the desert floor. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes.

Tracks in the sand. (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Jaivanna Ravenstehl is here, camouflaged. She wields a blood-stained javelin of bone in her left hand and a truesilver shield in her right. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.

Tracks in the sand. (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A grunting musk hog roots in the sand, giving off a vile stink. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana. Jaivanna Ravenstehl is here, camouflaged.

Tracks in the sand. (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The decaying remains of Jaivanna lie here. A bit of laurel bark lies here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A grunting musk hog roots in the sand, giving off a vile stink. Thema Edocar, Shou Tethe'alla, Herald of Salvation is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand.
You see exits leading southwest, northwest, and up.

Climbing the mesa. (Booming Dunes.) (13834)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A lovage leaf has been dropped here. There are 7 orphine seeds in 7 groups here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to the ground. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you.
You see exits leading up and down.

Tracks in the sand. (Booming Dunes.) (12283)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Great armed cacti loom over your head, and with the scrubby green-skinned trees provide a bit of welcome shade. At the base of one larger cacti, a prickly pear has large bites taken out of several lobes, spines and all. On the ground are what appear to be cloven hoofprints, similar to the tracks of a deer. Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The decaying remains of Jaivanna lie here. A bit of laurel bark lies here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A grunting musk hog roots in the sand, giving off a vile stink. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Ramsus Shinpachi is here, hidden. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand.

On the southern rim of the mesa. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (13837)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. With an edge so sudden it could have been cut with a knife, the mesa ends here. Occasional clatterings mark the slow crumbling of the mesa's lip, as small stones break lose and roll down the steep sides to the desert floor below. To one side, a rocky slope protrudes from the side of the mesa and slopes downward, making a narrow and treacherous path of sorts. Your eye is alerted to the presence of a sand-hued snake, barely perceptible amid the desert floor. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana.
You see exits leading north and southeast.

Your eye is alerted to the presence of a sand-hued snake, barely perceptible amid the desert floor. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A resplendent gardenia bush is elegantly set into a polished silver basin, lending a graceful beauty to the area. A tiny dragonfly, wrought in silver and rose quartz is positioned just above a fragrant white bloom. A weak and weary desert traveler is here, recovering in the shade of the mesa. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his surroundings. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Komatata Anar-Alurl, Seraphic Pride is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.

Several of the tracks lead to a nearby boulder, from which a pungent odor wafts. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A bit of laurel bark lies here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. The crushed translucent body of a bloodworm lies here in a pool of blood. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here. Ramsus Shinpachi is here, hidden.

On the hardpan. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (12278)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. This wide area of rolling ground between the larger dunes is both majestic and bleak. The ground consists of hard packed soil covered with coarse rocks and gravels. Amazingly, plant life is thriving here, taking many bizarre forms as the flora struggles to survive without water. Many-limbed cacti tower above you, the upright "arms" making them look like caricatures of startled mortals. Among these great cacti, green-skinned trees cling close to the ground, rarely rising over your head. There are many holes in the taller cacti, suggesting that birds use them for nesting. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Whirling about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Wings outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. With the occasional roar, a mountain lioness menacingly prowls close by. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Aidan, Aspect of Aryana. Ascetic of Body, Theophilus Aevus, Seeker of Strength is here.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, south, and west.

In a draw. (lost) (Booming Dunes.) (12279)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A resplendent gardenia bush is elegantly set into a polished silver basin, lending a graceful beauty to the area. A tiny dragonfly, wrought in silver and rose quartz is positioned just above a fragrant white bloom.
You see a single exit leading east.
