(vivisect)
You have recovered your breath and can smoke once more.
You yelp in pain as a spotted lynx bashes you.
Your steelweave surcoat completely absorbs the damage.
You step down off of a brilliant white Aorian stallion named Haichiilninj.

Drawing on the power of undeath, you wreathe your hand in black, crackling energy. With a diabolical laugh, you stiffen your hand and slowly run it down Iluv's
chest, splitting it open as you do so. With an expert touch, you rip apart his innards, causing a maximum of horrifying pain, and, enjoying the spectacle of
Iluv writhing and screaming in agony, you rip out his sternum and drive it through his splayed body, pinning him to the ground to die.
A fierce wolverine loses its grip on Iluv and drops to the ground.
You have slain Iluv.
