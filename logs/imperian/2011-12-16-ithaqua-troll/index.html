You have entered the campground of Alarick. A browned hide lies on the ground here. His muzzle grey and hoary with age, an elder of the village crouches here casting bones. Bundled in fur and leather, an Ithaquan village woman stands here silently. There are 2 Ithaquan villagers here. An elite Warden lancer is manning a cannon here. He has fifty-one cannon balls. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large cream colored Graytrem draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A dolorous baby elephant mopes around here, her little trunk snuffling the ground. There are 9 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. Mounted on an Ithaquan arctic wolf, an Idrasi wolfrider scans the area with a cold stare. A lithe yellow jaguar with black spots prowls the area. There are 5 elite Warden lancers here. A spirited Shaahri stallion trots about. A tengu hovers gently over the ground here. A fearsome lion prowls around here and greets you with a warning roar. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Lemuela Valstivar is here.

if nothing had happened.

You have recovered balance.

Leisane Valstivar says, "Now then, since we are not getting very far. You are 
given two choices. You may answer questions directed at you, or, if you choose 
to assault any other citizens without provocation, you will be removed. 
Forcibly."

withdraws his thumb from his mouth and wipes it on Leisane&#39;s arm.
 
Leisane Valstivar smiles impishly and says, "Then it is decided then."
 
Wiliam steps on Leisane&#39;s feet and he cups his chin, stroking his own with his 
free hand. "Well formed chin, shir." Wiliam comments right before he places a
