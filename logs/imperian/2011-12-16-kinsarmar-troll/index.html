The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. An unadorned bench of green marble sits here. Violet fire ripples over a tall obelisk of solid crystal, set into the very center of the crossroad. No bigger than a dwarf, a tiny marble fountain ofa cherubim has been placed here. A slender depiction in silver has been placed here, a resplendent sculpture of the Lady of the Arcane. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A wheeled cannon rests here. There are 2 eye sigils here. An irregular, broken rock lies here. A wooden goblet is sitting on the ground. A valuable suit of chain mail is here. A tiny dog with a profusion of springy curls upon her head and tail is running around in circles here. A fragile little bird with blush-coloured feathers is perched here, warbling a lovely tune. A large, gold flecked hawk hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the light. A noble mustang of blood-red colouring prances here, with eyes of silvery starlight. The wise glance of a snow owl passes over you. There are 6 elite Sidhe Skywatchers here. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a massive shire stands here poised and alert. A vicious smoke-blue stallion stands here, pawing and stomping ferociously at the ground. A strawberry-roan mare stands here, fidgeting impatiently as she occasionally noses at nearby objects. Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. There are 2 elite Lorekeeper Knights here. There are 26 elite Mages of Kinsarmar here. A fierce sabretooth tiger prowls silently here. An adorable calico kitten wanders here, chasing about imaginary bits of fluff. Sir Iltari Elenwe is here. He wields a sharpened quarterstaff in his hands. Galt Amherst is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a massive elemental war-staff in his right.
