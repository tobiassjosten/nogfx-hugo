Forest inside the arena walls. (North Eastern Arena.)
Within the arena walls, a virtual forest has managed to take over the arena grounds. Tall trees have spread their roots, slowly breaking down the rock that once saw the feet of countless warriors. The trees have started to push out to the walls, the tree roots only adding to the ruin that time has caused them. Several varieties of grass and flowers grow here, while only a few boulders indicate that this was ever anything but a forest. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially.

Forest inside the arena walls. (North Eastern Arena.)
Within the arena walls, a virtual forest has managed to take over the arena grounds. Tall trees have spread their roots, slowly breaking down the rock that once saw the feet of countless warriors. The trees have started to push out to the walls, the tree roots only adding to the ruin that time has caused them. Several varieties of grass and flowers grow here, while only a few boulders indicate that this was ever anything but a forest. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially.
You see exits leading north and west.

You command your Ouroboros to tear the soul from Hiramius. Faster than the eye can follow, its blood-red hands shoot out and quickly burrow into the chest of Hiramius who begins screaming as his body bucks and convulses from the massive shock. Peeling back its lips to reveal its maw, the Ouroboros roars in triumph and rips its powerful arms backwards, dragging an ephemeral, spiderweb substance with it: Hiramius's soul.

Hiramius, Aspect of Aryana leaves to the ether, a feeling of peace leaving with him.
You look around triumphantly and realize you are the last one standing. You have WON the Free-For-All!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
There are 2 beehives here. There is a small group of charcoal cinders here. Dotting the ground around you with black and yellow, lay a massive number of dead bees. Hovering in the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. Naharl is here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Hiramius, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a beechwood mandolin in his left hand and a small silver flute in his right.
You see a single exit leading down.

Forest inside the arena walls. (North Eastern Arena.)
Within the arena walls, a virtual forest has managed to take over the arena grounds. Tall trees have spread their roots, slowly breaking down the rock that once saw the feet of countless warriors. The trees have started to push out to the walls, the tree roots only adding to the ruin that time has caused them. Several varieties of grass and flowers grow here, while only a few boulders indicate that this was ever anything but a forest. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially.

Forest inside the arena walls. (North Eastern Arena.)
Within the arena walls, a virtual forest has managed to take over the arena grounds. Tall trees have spread their roots, slowly breaking down the rock that once saw the feet of countless warriors. The trees have started to push out to the walls, the tree roots only adding to the ruin that time has caused them. Several varieties of grass and flowers grow here, while only a few boulders indicate that this was ever anything but a forest. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially.
You see exits leading north and west.

You command your Ouroboros to tear the soul from Hiramius. Faster than the eye can follow, its blood-red hands shoot out and quickly burrow into the chest of Hiramius who begins screaming as his body bucks and convulses from the massive shock. Peeling back its lips to reveal its maw, the Ouroboros roars in triumph and rips its powerful arms backwards, dragging an ephemeral, spiderweb substance with it: Hiramius's soul.

Hiramius, Aspect of Aryana leaves to the ether, a feeling of peace leaving with him.
You look around triumphantly and realize you are the last one standing. You have WON the Free-For-All!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
There are 2 beehives here. There is a small group of charcoal cinders here. Dotting the ground around you with black and yellow, lay a massive number of dead bees. Hovering in the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. Naharl is here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Hiramius, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a beechwood mandolin in his left hand and a small silver flute in his right.
You see a single exit leading down.
