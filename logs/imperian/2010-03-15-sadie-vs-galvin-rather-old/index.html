Galvin whips his hands through the air, forming a red haze which disperses
about his body.

You move in towards Galvin for the backbreaker.
You lift Galvin triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised
knee with back breaking force.
Galvin cries out in pain.

A thin net trails the arrow, entangling you as it strikes.
You suddenly feel that it would be a fine idea to relax your cloak defence.

You move in towards Galvin for the backbreaker.
You lift Galvin triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised
knee with back breaking force.
With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, hedgehog's head lolls aimlessly
far too far to one side. Hedgehog collapses into such an undignified sprawl
that you realise that the throw did indeed snap the spine like a dry twig.
You have slain Galvin.
Defeated, Galvin is cast out of the Arena.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92467a33c20ef4c2d82bb7101089334b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dgroz093@xxx on 15 Mar 2010</p><p>&ldquo;With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, HEDGEHOG&rsquo;s head lolls aimlessly
