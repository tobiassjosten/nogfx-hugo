Killing anyone as a Priest is difficult. Killing another Priest as a Priest is next to impossible. There are limiters to Priest combat called seraph power and devotion. These are not infinite. Priests are also not immortal. Your normal non-artifacted tri-trans Priest ~ levek 85-90 is actually not all that hard to kill. The defensive artifacts are what cause the percieved issue. And honestly with the level of artifacts on some Priests you wouldn&rsquo;t kill them no matter what profession they were.</p><p>It absolutely does take skill to kill as a Priest. They have one of the worst offenses in the game. Anyone can kill with Diabolist, Wytch, Mage, Bard or Monk. Kill someone using your truly terrible offense that has no holding power?

As a fellow Australian I can agree that this is a huge factor, but I would argue that the huge compliment of passive healing a Cleric comes equipped with and the edge of your seat shielding sometimes required to prevent sap-absolve by a diademed Cleric means that it&rsquo;s generally a bigger issue for the opponent. An extra second on the leg cure against a monk matters less when you can aura (assuming you still can).</p></li><li><p>Priest skill level
You&rsquo;re right, my formula assumes a healthy skill buy.</p></li><li><p>Number of opponents
My formula was for 1v1&rsquo;s, but I would argue that a Cleric is actually decently placed to survive ganks compared to most other classes. Warding is one of the better ways of preventing instant kills out there, passive healing can prevent affliction overload and the ability to seraph aura means that shielding can continue even in the face of pindown or ciguatoxin spam.</p></li></ul></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f82196323cf7d5b4cd8d44608439bf2?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by guardian106@xxx on 31 Aug 2010</p><p>Too many people whine about not being able to kill Priests and don&rsquo;t spend enough time trying to find ways TO kill them.

A decent healing system combined with lifevision, aspect-life-vision, active healing, passive healing or just occasionally curing paralysis and touching tree made killing anyone competent a hugely uphill struggle.</p><p>I know you often say that Priest takes skill because your offense basically requires you to maneuver them into not shielding the absolve (because of recklessness) or not preventing the judge (by panicking or off-timing). Assassin required that a person either not cure Sun Allergy for sixty (60) seconds or Ciguatoxin long enough for me to garrote them to death (often a long time). Please believe me when I tell you that making either of these two things happen on a competent player was hugely difficult, especially as a level 82~ Ssylsin/Fast with no defensive artifacts.</p><p>Still, much as you did with bards and vodun-wytchen, I worked hard and secured kills.

I worked hard and killed people of every class and every profession, when they made mistakes&mldr; except priests.</p><p>I was more confident of securing a kill on Life-Aspect Siath (0.01%)than I was on Cardi. I was more confident of securing a kill on Eldreth (0.01%)than I was on like&mldr; Malikir. I agree that there are class imbalances that are never going away no matter how hard we try. Please take it from someone who worked very, very hard to be the best Assassin they could be when I say that instant-diagnose was simply too much, and something that from my experience playing a Cleric, they can easily afford to train for offensive upgrades.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f82196323cf7d5b4cd8d44608439bf2?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by guardian106@xxx on 01 Sep 2010</p><p>Assassins are pretty poor offensively all around.

Let&rsquo;s face it, affliction healing is what the Healing skill set&rsquo;s main purpose is. It needs to be replaced entirely but piecemeal striking down what makes it actually decent is not something I can support. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your illusion removal and upgrade of hypnosis assuming you also upgrade hypochondria to about 66% chance of preventing a diagnose. That&rsquo;s a good compromise here, one that gets you what you want with affecting Priests against other professions. One that I endorsed when they originally changed hypochondria to have a chance to prevent diagnose.</p><p>As I said in response to Khizan&rsquo;s post, replaced Healing with an edited form of Tarot. Getting rid of the Healing skillset is something that needs to happen to push the profession out of it&rsquo;s defensive heavy stalemate role and into something that&rsquo;s more balanced. Tarot has a nice mix of offensive, defensive and utility and would provide the hinder Priest needs. This would also allow prone shield to go away as well as all active affliction healing, bedevil and instant diagnose. Moving the spiritshields to Fayth will ensure circle balance.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4cc7e0506cfbe0429da405f560f2407?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by Raijin77@xxx on 02 Sep 2010</p><p>Okay @Guardian106 - No disrespect because I honestly have no clue who you truly are. People are saying Guardas, but I don&rsquo;t even know who that is. I&rsquo;ve been playing roughly two months now. So far I can tell, I&rsquo;m a Deathknight with lifevision and a few passive abilities such as - Gravehands, Deathaura. The rest is all up to afflictions which basically I either have to get a 224 speed sabre or better. ( This is with runes of course to balance to 231 which gives me a 2.0 balance. ) Though, if I basically obtain a 231 speed sabre I could do a 2.0 DSL which is 1 toxin per second. Adding Deathaura into the situation which basically ticks on the same as the TREE TATTOO. Even with lifevision, illusions aren&rsquo;t the main problem. Assassin /and/ or Renegade is basically an ambush class. I&rsquo;ve seen Linelle, or Justus walk into the room and crush 3+ people alone. All tier 1 fighters with artifacts. I have 0 artifacts, and I&rsquo;m double trans. I try to manage on my own, though it&rsquo;s quite rough. Shielding/aura only gets so far. When you add DARTS/COBRA into the situation it gets rough. Darts now break shield, I believe it&rsquo;s a 33% chance of breaking the shield? I could be mistaken&mldr;</p><p>Though, as I have said&mldr; anyone basically as a FAST Assassin or Renegade can basically overload ANY profession other than Priest, Bards and Diabolists. ( because of their passive abilites / demons / and the overall evileye that can be used prone ) It&rsquo;s quite insane. I&rsquo;ve been stacked with 20+ afflictions in over a 40 second period with my normal healing. I don&rsquo;t have purge or focus though it&rsquo;s the overwhelming fact that without an intimidation pet or cowardice I&rsquo;m basically eating the herbs of what the cobra does on a normal tick. Adding DSTAB/DARTS into the situation causes problems. Honestly, I would say reduce the DSTAB speed&mldr; or remove the darts breaking the shield. Maybe if I had purge or focus I could put a strong suggestion into this table of - Expertness - as I haven&rsquo;t played as long. Though, like I said&mldr; the assassin/renegade profession honeslty in my own personal opinion is overpowered to all except the three professions I named. Not everything is balanced or matched properly. You will ocassionally be mis-matched. Though, it&rsquo;s the over-whelming factor alone that they crush basically 75%+ of this game&mldr; Even with fitness it&rsquo;s extremely hard for me to keep up with the afflictions.</p><p>Now, Wardancers on the other hand&mldr; I&rsquo;ve seen this dude Zyran&mldr; literally do a 1.5 flicking speed of two toxins&mldr; thats just insane. Herb eating is 3.0. He&rsquo;s basically doing 4 toxins on 1 herb balance. Adding double-dance which they now have it&rsquo;s basically unstoppable. The Sentinel dance also prevents their enemy from leaving the room - unless the defence is stripped which is race depending on the opponent. Or - Prisming/blackwind/astralform/pathfinder/ the list is endless&mldr;. Though, going back to the factor that he or she would deal a 1.5 speed of two toxins prevents EITHER of those. Basically, the person who is stupid enough to stay in the room - other than priests, bards, assassins, or renegades is utterly retarded. Now, I also have some questions and problems in-regards with my own profession and I need some help. If anyone coule please send me some advice and feedback it would be appreciated. Thank you ~Raij</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4cc7e0506cfbe0429da405f560f2407?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by Raijin77@xxx on 02 Sep 2010</p>On the part that I stated it was based on the RACE.

Don&rsquo;t fight in dart traps. When you get the lessons, teach your hound intimidate. This is necessary anyways for bards unless you like eating sketches. I&rsquo;d suggest consulting a DK combatant for more in-depth advice.</p><p>Not to offend you but, Linelle and Justus both have tons of artifacts and know what they&rsquo;re doing. You can&rsquo;t really rate yourself against them. Their dstabs are much quicker than normal. They may kill Tier one people with artifacts but both of them have been playing a long time. When I say &ldquo;higher tier combat&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean the ingame tiers. I mean the player skill level. Artifacts != skill but skill+artifacts means things are going to get a bit deadly.</p><p>You really need to keep learning before you can contribute to this conversation. You&rsquo;ll come to realize that no matter what profession the top folks are, they&rsquo;re going to kill 75% of the people in the game. They have invested significant time and money to have that advantage. As for Wardancer flicking, yes it&rsquo;s a bit ridiculous and maybe needs to be looked at but again, you&rsquo;re still missing focus and purge.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92467a33c20ef4c2d82bb7101089334b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dgroz093@xxx on 02 Sep 2010</p><ol><li><p>Guardas is right (I had to copy paste that letter by letter from separate web-pages because my fingers spasm&rsquo;d at the strangeness of typing it), Focus, faster tree balance and Purge make a difference so large as to defy description. Having focus means a Saboteur basically can&rsquo;t use mental afflictions on you without hypnotizing the impatience first because they just melt off instantly. Stupidity is ridiculously powerful if you dont&rsquo; have focus to deal with it. Likewise, the Saboteur DSTAB speed of 3.00 is designed around herb balance + purge. Against herb balance alone, it can be overwhelming.</p></li><li><p>I don&rsquo;t know whom these Tier 1 people are that Linelle and Justus are beating 1v3 but I can pretty confidently state they&rsquo;re doing something incredibly wrong. Nira and I used to take on groups of like 7-8 people, but we relied on those people being retarded. The whole thing fell apart as soon as Silken showed up and started teaching people basic combat logic like, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re having trouble with the meanie Saboteur illusion spammers, have someone step out of the room and axe-stun them into oblivion.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>As a DK without an artifact weapon you&rsquo;re going to struggle to kill an assassin because their dodge rate is so high and they have shrugging. I would almost go so far as to suggest using a pair of longswords or some other high to-hit weapon and aiming for a vivisect if you&rsquo;re finding the dodge-rate to be utterly crippling in securing the quad break. DK vs Assassin is a brutal matchup though.</p></li><li><p>Fast affliction rates are scary, but you have to take a step back and consider which afflictions are truly fatal to you. Make sure that your system eliminates sun allergy, toxin relapse and paralysis on a high priority an assassin will struggle very hard to kill you. With fitness you are essentially immune to toxin locks and with putrefaction you can&rsquo;t be put to sleep (is this still the case?). A wardancer can stack all the afflictions he likes, as soon as he switches away from his tickle-sabres and onto his slower, damaging weapons, a diagnose and a good priority queue should have the afflictions melting off you. Once the paralysis is gone, a few vigours may be needed to keep you up, but that&rsquo;s about it.</p></li><li><p>The reason assassin&rsquo;s run around gutterstomping 95% of Imperian is that they rely on a mechanic that is counterable only by having a very well written, custom system, having instant diagnose or having a huge volume of passive affliction healing or disable. The caveat to this is that assassins will bounce the hell off the other 5% like they hit a wall at full speed. It&rsquo;s a dumb mechanic and it always has been.</p></li></ol></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx on 02 Sep 2010</p><p>Raijin77:</p><p>Herb eating is 1.5, not 3.0. Zyran has an attack rate of about that I&rsquo;m fairly sure. The only upside of this is that flick deals pathetic damage, however you still remain pretty much locked down forever. I can only advice repeated attempts to tumble, that way he has to use opium, which isn&rsquo;t sticking any more toxins on you. As a knight yourself, you have to try and swing the momentum back around to your favor.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4cc7e0506cfbe0429da405f560f2407?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by Raijin77@xxx on 03 Sep 2010</p><p>@notnowar - Well for some odd reason it&rsquo;s 3.0 by my count. Unless something is seriously wrong with my connection which I doubt&mldr;. I&rsquo;m just stating my knowledge so far.</p><p>@Guardian - Yes, I know I&rsquo;m lacking abilities, but making my own personal opinions and assumptions is my call. As I said, I&rsquo;m not extremely well fond of the entire realms combat system. But even teaching my own intimidate, gaining focus, perma tree, and purge blood. It&rsquo;s still a ridiculous amount of afflictions. And not fighting them in DARTS. Yes, I can see where you are coming from basically fighting in DARTS is death I get that. But when you HAVE too fight them in darts. via Arena Matches, or defending your city/Council you have too. I hate to say it, but I&rsquo;d seriously like to see the affliction rate dropped down a little or removing the darts ability to immobilize shielding abilities completely.</p><p>@Dgroz - Yes, I understand that. Though as the same principles apply to all three of you. I&rsquo;m still learning and now my entire client has looped causing my system to go faulty. Now I&rsquo;m back to scratch and I believe I won&rsquo;t even be combat ready for another month or so. I basically only had the typical afflictions and abilities. Over time and dedication I&rsquo;m sure I will completely finish it. But the fact remains that it&rsquo;s time consuming and adding real life shit is making me do: HEAD-DESK. I honestly believe for the people who have spent real life currency into this game and the constant updating of the system is by far the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I&rsquo;d rather go sit on my ass and play MW2 or MGS4. Even the ocassional LoL or SC2 is fine. Though, my assistance in the game and my current role in the Noctusari has left me to just steadily keep going. I&rsquo;m probably going to stay out of combat for a while and just move into politics and heavy roleplaying.</p><p>@Everyone - I appreciate all the advice and feedback, but stay safe and please trolling or raging over people. I understand that some of you may be experienced Imperian fighters or knowledeable in the game period. But trolling and raging over people just because you have a shitty life or you&rsquo;re just looking for a reason to pick on someone. Just please think to yourself and remember that you&rsquo;re a human being and people do have feelings. Just a friendly reminder. When it comes down to it, it&rsquo;s only a game. If you push someone to the point where they will literally come find you and kill you. You will know when you&rsquo;re dead that I gave you some expert advice. I literally got put into the hospital over a damn game. I was playing MK4 wayyy back in the day in this tournanment this dude literally beat the living fuck out of me for whipping his ass. So please, be careful and take note. Thank you - ~Raijin.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx on 03 Sep 2010</p><p>That&rsquo;s awful - I&rsquo;m sorry to hear about what happened to you.
