IC resolution to this other
 than to tell Alitis he fails, so I fail to see how this constitutes being worthy of an issue. Additionally, 

Alitis received word that 
anti-magickers were trespassing in Kinsmarian territory and sought to punish them for this, just as an 

Antiochian would likewise punish
 a Kinsmarian bashing party for trespassing in their territory. Regardless I must emphasize the utter lack 

of attempt at IC resolution.
 Finally, Zephurus did not die, and as per HELP USINGISSUES, filing an issue on behalf of another is against 

the rules.
You post your response to issue #95375. Thank you.

than to tell Alitis he fails, so I fail to see how this constitutes being worthy of an issue. Additionally,
Alitis received word that

Antiochian would likewise punish
a Kinsmarian bashing party for trespassing in their territory. Regardless I must emphasize the utter lack
of attempt at IC resolution.

Kinsarmar Crossroads. (City of Kinsarmar.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. Occasional drops of rain fall to
the ground from a sky grey with pregnant clouds. A rune circle has been
sketched into the ground here. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. An
unadorned bench of green marble sits here. Violet fire ripples over a tall
obelisk of solid crystal, set into the very center of the crossroad. A slender
depiction in silver has been placed here, a resplendent sculpture of the Lady
of the Arcane. A plain metal bell rests upon the ground here. A plain metal
chest rests upon the ground here. Its long, smooth tail curled around its legs,
an exotic canine sits here peacefully. There are 18 Kinsarmarian Mages here. A
Lorekeeper Knight is manning a bolt thrower here. He has thirty-three bolts. An
obsidian eye sigil is here. A Lorekeeper Knight stands here, twin runed blades
at his sides. With a wild look in his eye, a feral paint stallion stands
heatedly here as he stomps and paces recklessly. A cerulean female bazwolf
rests on her haunches nearby, ears perked. A sinewy snake rushes through the
waters. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large cream colored
Graytrem draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. An adorable calico
kitten wanders here, chasing about imaginary bits of fluff. A small forest of
sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. An icewall is here, blocking
passage to the south. Lady Iselie, Archmagus of Earth is here, grinning
mischievously. She wields an elemental staff in her left hand and a tower
shield in her right. Sir Doshar Elith is here. He wields an elemental staff in
his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.
