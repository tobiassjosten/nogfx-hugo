Sadie and Mihochi are sitting on the ground. You see a single exit leading southwest.

Sadie gives Mihochi a compassionate hug.

Mihochi smiles sweetly, leaning over and rubbing noses with Sadie.

Sadie tenderly strokes Mihochi&#39;s cheek.

Mihochi gives Sadie a thoughtful smile, her admiration for her evident in her 
warm gaze.

Sadie sways to and fro.

Sadie Wyrdim, the Angry Panda Dancer says, "Love, love, love."

Mihochi giggles happily.

Kunteki Mihochi Farrell-Covenia, Avowed of Charity says, "Loveness!"

Sadie Wyrdim, the Angry Panda Dancer says, "Much loveness!"

Kunteki Mihochi Farrell-Covenia, Avowed of Charity says, "So so much loveness."

Mihochi stretches her arms out as far as they can go and uses her tail to lengthen the measurement "I love you this much!"

Mihochi giggles happily.

Sadie widens her arms, copying your gesture, though upon realizing she can&#39;t win, she instead embraces you. "And I love you more then I can possibly hope to explain."

Mihochi giggles happily and pulls you into her as you embrace her, wrapping her legs around your waist so you are sitting entwined again. Her lips brush against yours and she sighs contently her softs sweet breath across your lips before she leans in and kisses you tenderly.

Sadie squeezes you gently against her, returning your kiss with an easy grace, her own breath as warm and sweet as yours. Her hands find their way beneath your clothes, coming to rest upon the bare flesh of your back, the elf whimpering a happy sigh at the feeling of your softness beneath her touch.

Mihochi moves tight against you as your hands find her soft skin once more. Her lips travel down to your neck where she nibbles and kisses her hands pulling you close they mimic yours and trace patterns into your soft skin.

Sadie tilts her head back to allow you free reign over the soft flesh of her neck, the slightest of sighs escaping her lips as her eyes flutter shut and her hands squeeze playfully at your back.

Mihochi runs her hand into the top of your shirt and pulls it to the side gently kissing and nibbling lower, she pulls at your first button. Her other hand continuing it&#39;s caress up and down your spine.

Sadie quivers against you, unable to resist a shuddery whimper as your lips make their way along her smooth and pale skin, such touch something forgotten to her. Unthinkingly, she presses herself against you, a hapless attempt to rub herself up agsinst your beautiful form. Her fingers claw aimlessley at your back, moving up down and side to side without any purpose other then just because.

Mihochi gently guides you the ground but before removing her cloak and laying it down so that you are not cold from the chilled floor. Placing her legs either side of your hips she leans down and pops open each button slowly her lips following her fingers. Once your shirt is full open she runs her tongue along your breast gently licking and nibbling before coming to your nipple and sucking ever so gently.

Sadie bites at her lip, though this does little to stop her from whimpering in obvious delight, and certainly does nothing to stop her whole body from trembling ever so slightly against you. Freeing her arms from behind you, she instead lets her hands rest gently upon your head, her fingers toying playfully, thoughtfully with your hair. "I love you so," she murmurs, as the swell of her chest rises and falls against your lips, "ever so, ever so much."

Mihochi licks gently on your nipple her fingers running across your breast before she turns her attention to the other. Kissing across from one nipple to the other slowly and deliberately. Feeling your fingers in her hair she shivers her tail swaying contently behind her, "I love you too oh sweetness of mine" she says between kisses.

Sadie gazes down at you, her jade eyes roving over the beauty of your face, watching you with a kindred compassion as your tongue flickers this way and that over the small pink nubs of her nipples. Extending a hand, she reaches playfully for the tip of your tail, pulling it in closer to both herself and you so as she can play with it idly, her other hand still lost admist your hair, stroking, fiddling and gently ruffling.

Mihochi runs a finger down your stomach and gently strokes along the waistband teasing at the button as her lips travel slowly down your stomach. Her tongue lapping gently at your soft toned skin. Her tail twitches happily in your grasp and she looks up at you mischieviously as her kiss reaches the top of your shorts.
