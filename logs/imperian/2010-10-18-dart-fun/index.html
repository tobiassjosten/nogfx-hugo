--- Aryana's Spring ------- 0:0:0 ---
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Gore is splattered 
about, a display of Dias's cruel handiwork. The spring of crystalline water 
gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a 
shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of 
inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the 
floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite 
stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A 
painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the 
surrounding area. A small sign points into a market stall. A shattered statue 
of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the 
throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses 
here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base 
filled with offerings. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving
in the wind. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of
the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and 
striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here
depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin 
stands here, marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his
surroundings. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth
stands here with confidence and aloofness. Rais Awwal Sadie Wyrdim is here. She
wields a curved sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

--- Aryana's Spring ------- 0:0:0 ---
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Gore is splattered
about, a display of Dias's cruel handiwork. The spring of crystalline water
gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a
shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of
inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the
floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite
stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A
painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the
surrounding area. A small sign points into a market stall. A shattered statue
of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of
light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the
throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses
here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base
filled with offerings. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving
in the wind. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of
the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and
striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here
depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin
stands here, marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his
gaze cast over the Springs. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his
surroundings. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth
stands here with confidence and aloofness. Rais Awwal Sadie Wyrdim is here. She
wields a curved sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway
leads down.

This situation is OP, but it requires, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, a lot o preparation, you need to hope no one else sets off your traps too. Kill the butterfly, and you should be able to avoid the impale and drag since no transfix, you writhe out of web faster then the time for the hunter, and that way, they can&rsquo;t impale you.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9709d27e0c92499c995b65a9553028e0?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by tonykunz@xxx on 23 Oct 2010</p>unenemy Ivellios

Dragging requires a ton of preparation. Sadie only got down so easily was because she builds her own system and didn&rsquo;t have the Gladiator line, she had it for the spear. The thing requires getting a good quad break, and laying traps can take a while. Then you have to impale and pray that the dude doesn&rsquo;t writhe out before you recover equilibrium. Its OP and all that shit but its definitely not that easy to carry out</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
