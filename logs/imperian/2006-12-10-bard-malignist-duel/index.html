its flesh twitching. With an effortless thrust, it launches itself against you,

You must regain your equilibrium first.

You command your Ouroboros to tear the soul from Vaughn. Faster than the eye
can follow, its blood-red hands shoot out and quickly burrow into the chest of
Vaughn who begins screaming as his body bucks and convulses from the massive
shock. Peeling back its lips to reveal its maw, the Ouroboros roars in triumph
