Dusty plains nearing desert. (Heartlands.)
A small rune-covered jaguar skull has been left on the ground here. A sachet of bath salts has been left here, the enchanting scent of vanilla wafting from the small p
arcel. A linseed lies here. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A fetid stench informs you that a colossal one-eyed hound is here. A black o
uroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. A golden hued, sun bear of the Shaahri desert is here. The undead form of Myrmidon Azefel is her
e. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a dwarven battleaxe in his right. Lord Oburi Nessaja is riding on an armoured battle stallion. He wields a vodun doll
roughly resembling Luodo in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. The undead form of Lord Aedius Reopev is here. He is holding a truesilver shield in his left
hand. Sapp De'Linguilette is here, shrouded. He is holding a lunar shield in his right hand.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, south, and northwest.
