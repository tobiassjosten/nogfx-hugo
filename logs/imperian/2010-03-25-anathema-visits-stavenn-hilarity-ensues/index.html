Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction winks Her rotting eye, then laughs eerily as the eyeball actually plops out and onto the ground. Some centipedes walk up to the eye and crawl their way back to Her eye socket, inserting it back with a wet pop.

Breav doffs his hat cordially at Anathema.

You give Anathema a respectful salute.

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, "Rots Greetings, Stavenn."

(DK): You say, "Goddess of putrefaction = lol."

Equilibrium Taken: 3.75s
You concentrate for a moment and your flesh begins to dissolve away, becoming slimy and wet.

(DK): Sadie says, "Hm?"

Ashel gives Anathema a respectful salute.

(DK): You say, "Anathema&#39;s at gates."

You say, "What brings you to the capital, m&#39;Lady?"

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, "I&#39;ve decided to bless you with My Presence, to see how things decay."

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction tilts Her head ever so slightly to the left as She focuses intently upon the spoken words, the shift disturbing a centipede that wriggles out of Her decaying ear and falls to the floor. She quickly grabs the centipede and tosses it into Her mouth, a sick crunching noise follows.

Verick&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Verick bows respectfully to Anathema.

Breav ponders the situation.

Lady Anathema twists Her Neck to look at Verick.

Breav Argyle says, "It&#39;s been fair, I suppose, around here."

You shrug helplessly.

You say, "Steady if anything."

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, "Has much blood been spilled, have you been causing other cities to Decay?"

Calling upon the Necromantic essence within you, you begin the slow process of willing your own living body into a state of undeath.
Equilibrium Taken: 5.50s

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction allows a wry smile to grace Her lips, the action pulling back the fragments of festering lip on the left side of Her face to reveal a ghastly white jawbone.

Your flesh turns pallid as your body slowly dies and is reborn again in an abhorrent state of undeath.

You say, "Their defences were strengthen as were ours."

Breav Argyle says, "Not enough, I suppose, but not due to a lack of attempt."

You say, "The days of Death under my reign are long gone."

Mortificare Ashel Savet, the Instrument of Grief says, "From all the tears they&#39;re shedding, you&#39;d think we already brought down an apocalypse on them."

Ashel rams the butt end of a pike into the ground and impales Trethyn&#39;s head on it, leaving it as a warning.

Mortificare Ashel Savet, the Instrument of Grief says, "Unfortunately for them, it&#39;s just beginning."

Lady Anathema looks at you, eyeing you carefully as if deciding your worth.

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, "They need to be brought back to a state of Decay, to learn what it is to Rot and Fester."

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, "May Rot carry you all through with a renewed strength, Stavenn."

Lady Anathema winks Her Good Eye, some eyelashes falling from it as She does this. The Eyelashes travel around the room for a few moments before turning to dust.

A brief flickering of Her form presages the sudden vanishment of the Griever, the hole in reality She once filled left as no more than a spot of cold air with a faint redolence of decay. A brief crawling sensation under your skin is a chill reminder of the maggots that writhed beneath Her decayed flesh.

(Stavenn): You say, "It seems I can&#39;t give the new faces the same trust that old faces like Ephor Verick or the Mortificare have earned. Next person to lead a squad walk into a raid group without a hint of preparation like Shukron did earns my disfavor."

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction has bestowed Her divine truefavour upon you. It will last for 24 hours.

You sent the following message to Anathema: Thank you, m&#39;Lady. May I ask how I have earned your blessing?
Anathema would like you to know that: The Rot that consumes shall one day consume all that you know and all that you thought you were.

(Brofist): You say, "Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction has bestowed Her divine truefavour upon you. It will last for 24 hours."

(Brofist): Joran says, "Nice."

(Brofist): Kyrock says, "Whoa."

(Brofist): Ashel says, "Hahah, nice."
