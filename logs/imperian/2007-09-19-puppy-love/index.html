Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. This quiet meadow in the lake basin boasts soft grasses, and softer 
soil. The entire area feels gentle, peaceful. The air is cool and mild, stirred
from time to time by light breezes wafting through the meadow. A few low lying 
bushes dot the landscape, their foliage dark green against the light grass. A 
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Ria is sitting on

from time to time by light breezes wafting through the meadow. A few low lying
bushes dot the landscape, their foliage dark green against the light grass. A
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Ria is sitting on
the ground. Milite Shayda is here.
You see a single exit leading northwest.

H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda says, "Which lake?"
Milite Shayda says, "I thought you were okay with me using your hound."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>

around."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>

You say, "Go ahead then."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria peers at you unscrupulously.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Shayda shrugs helplessly.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda strips and kneels down again, stroking the hound once more, a
wicked grin directed at Kheoss.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria tells you, "You're going to let her do this?"
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
The air grows moist as occasional drops of rain fall from the sky.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
ria heh why not she's crazy enough to do it
You tell Ria Argyle, "She HAS to be joking she won't."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria tells you, "Your poor hound will be traumatized!"
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda turns back to the dog, moving her hand to stroke it's underbelly,
a soft smile on her lips as she whispers soothing words into it's ear.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
ria we all will be traumatized
You tell Ria Argyle, "We all will be traumatized."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>

H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda 's smile returns to a grin as her hand descends lower, rubbing
gently over the dog's genital areas, stroking the sheath there with a gentle,
but firm caress.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria tells you, "Very very true...mhm. Couldn't she get kicked out of the city
and the Sabs for this?"
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>

Shayda smirks.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda says, "Fine."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
The raindrops are coming down lightly, but regularly now, dampening everything
around you.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>

You say, "You need to find a new hobby."
Milite Shayda says, "Well, it's better than abducting small, helpless girls."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria tells you, "You should kill her...I just might get sick..."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda shoots a quick glance at Ria.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>

H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda says, "You consume the flesh and hearts of those around you to
suit your own diabolical whims. Why can't I pleasure a dog?"
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria Argyle says, "What the hell is wrong with men? You'd rather have a dog than
a strong, flesh and blood man?!"

H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda says to Ria, "I love men. I love men more than animals."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
A light rain wets your surroundings.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria Argyle asks, "Then why the animals?"
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria Argyle exclaims, "Just get a man!"
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda says, "Because I'd be a slut if I walked up to a man and said,
"Hey, let's fuck."."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria Argyle says, "But you fuck DOGS! That's worse."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Milite Shayda says, "I've also fucked an Ouroboros."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria shivers violently.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria Argyle says, "Okay..."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria tells you, "I am going to be sick..."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>

The drizzle stops entirely, leaving only heavy cloud cover.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Ria Argyle slaps a hand over her mouth and closes her eyes.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
You say, "Sooooo."
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
The lonely cry of a circling hawk fills you with unexplained remorse.

H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Shayda shrugs helplessly.
H:314 M:326 &lt;eb>
Daehune has been hacked to death by an orc scout.
