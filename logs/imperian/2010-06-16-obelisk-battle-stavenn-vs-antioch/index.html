Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The corpse of Ageranu is here, impaled by a narrow bone. A note on 
it reads, 'This is the end of those who would trifle with Trez.'  There are 6 maidenhair leaves in 4 groups here. The decaying remains of Markie lie here. There are 2 
pieces of kelp in a group here. A bit of laurel bark lies here. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes 
of ice blue. A fetid stench informs you that a colossal one-eyed hound is here. A large red and brown desert buffalo stands here, claws instead of hooves digging into 
the ground with tremendous force. There are 2 black ouroboros here. A demon resembling a large spider idly paces here. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears per
ked and alert. A black wolf stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey. The body of a young rat lies here. There are 3 corpses of a black rat here. There are 6 co
rpses of a rat here. There are 3 corpses of an old rat here. The body of a dead baby rat lies here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eye
s glaring from out of the darkness. The undead form of Lord of the Damned, Iluv Arkadis, the Vandal of Decay is here. He wields a scourgebone daegger in his left hand 
and a tower shield in his right. The undead form of Myrmidon Azefel is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a dwarven battleaxe in his right. The undead
 form of Zerin Arkadis, the Infernal is here. She wields a wicked-looking daegger in her left hand and a cruelly spiked white tower shield in her right.

The southern side of a sandstone obelisk.
Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The corpse of Ageranu is here, impaled by a narrow bone. A note on
it reads, 'This is the end of those who would trifle with Trez.' There are 6 maidenhair leaves in 4 groups here. The decaying remains of Markie lie here. There are 2
pieces of kelp in a group here. A bit of laurel bark lies here. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes
of ice blue. A fetid stench informs you that a colossal one-eyed hound is here. A large red and brown desert buffalo stands here, claws instead of hooves digging into
the ground with tremendous force. There are 2 black ouroboros here. A demon resembling a large spider idly paces here. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears per
ked and alert. A black wolf stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey. The body of a young rat lies here. There are 3 corpses of a black rat here. There are 6 co
rpses of a rat here. There are 3 corpses of an old rat here. The body of a dead baby rat lies here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eye
s glaring from out of the darkness. The undead form of Lord of the Damned, Iluv Arkadis, the Vandal of Decay is here. He wields a scourgebone daegger in his left hand
and a tower shield in his right. The undead form of Myrmidon Azefel is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a dwarven battleaxe in his right. The undead
form of Zerin Arkadis, the Infernal is here. She wields a wicked-looking daegger in her left hand and a cruelly spiked white tower shield in her right.
You see a single exit leading north.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+3 points with 3 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2894dc2b8a4d7ad85bf074f6770cc81a?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by zemory@xxx on 16 Jun 2010</p>Yeahhh..
