A junction of Wendigo catwalk. (Ithaquan Council.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Inside the village, a 
broad and well maintained catwalk runs in a wide circle. The pathway stretches 
from limb to limb, reaching out to the east and west. Across a wide open 
expanse, the far side of the catwalk can be seen threaded through dense and 
foreboding growth. The branches of the huge pines here are rimed with frost, 
great icicles hanging from every thick limb like savage knives. A sign is 
carved into the thickest tree, marked with one word: "Wendigo." This has been 
marked as holy ground. There are 2 Ithaquan villagers here. A Warden lancer is 
manning a cannon here. He has 117 cannon balls. There are 2 sinuous sorrel 
geldings here. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands 
here imperially. Emanating an aura of power and strength, a large polar bear 
stands here. A fearsome lion prowls around here and greets you with a warning 
roar. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the room. Bundled in fur and 
leather, an Ithaquan village woman stands here silently. There are 3 Idrasi 
wolfriders here. There are 2 Warden lancers here. His muzzle grey and hoary 
with age, an elder of the village crouches here casting bones. Gliding 
silently, a grey Ithaquan kestrel scans the ground below for prey. Fur ashen in
hue, a coyote scouts about for food. Bright blue eyes gazing at her 
surroundings, an albino yearling stands impatiently here, occasionally swatting
the air with an agile hoof. A pike with the decapitated head of Brenandon has 
been erected. Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces 
the area. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a massive shire stands here 
poised and alert. You have entered the campground of Leska. There are 58 
charcoal cinders in 32 groups here. A great horned owl is perched here, gazing 
coldly at his surroundings. A cloud of smoke fills the area, coming from a 
campfire in the center of a campground. Master Varil Anar is here. Master 
Xaarin Agarwaen, Kunteki of Manoa is here. Dei&#39;laiga Juanope Vollice is here. 
She wields a sleek javelin in her left hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.

A junction of Wendigo catwalk. (Ithaquan Council.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Inside the village, a
broad and well maintained catwalk runs in a wide circle. The pathway stretches
from limb to limb, reaching out to the east and west. Across a wide open
expanse, the far side of the catwalk can be seen threaded through dense and
foreboding growth. The branches of the huge pines here are rimed with frost,
great icicles hanging from every thick limb like savage knives. A sign is
carved into the thickest tree, marked with one word: "Wendigo." This has been
marked as holy ground. There are 2 Ithaquan villagers here. A Warden lancer is
manning a cannon here. He has 117 cannon balls. There are 2 sinuous sorrel
geldings here. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands
here imperially. Emanating an aura of power and strength, a large polar bear
stands here. A fearsome lion prowls around here and greets you with a warning
roar. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the room. Bundled in fur and
leather, an Ithaquan village woman stands here silently. There are 3 Idrasi
wolfriders here. There are 2 Warden lancers here. His muzzle grey and hoary
with age, an elder of the village crouches here casting bones. Gliding
silently, a grey Ithaquan kestrel scans the ground below for prey. Fur ashen in
hue, a coyote scouts about for food. Bright blue eyes gazing at her
surroundings, an albino yearling stands impatiently here, occasionally swatting
the air with an agile hoof. A pike with the decapitated head of Brenandon has
been erected. Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces
the area. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a massive shire stands here
poised and alert. You have entered the campground of Leska. There are 58
charcoal cinders in 32 groups here. A great horned owl is perched here, gazing
coldly at his surroundings. A cloud of smoke fills the area, coming from a
campfire in the center of a campground. Master Varil Anar is here. Master
Xaarin Agarwaen, Kunteki of Manoa is here. Dei'laiga Juanope Vollice is here.
She wields a sleek javelin in her left hand.
