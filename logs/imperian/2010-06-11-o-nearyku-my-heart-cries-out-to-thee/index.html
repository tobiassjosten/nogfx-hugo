Issue #96647   Reported by: Nearyku    Re: Sanai
2010-06-11 05:56:34: 
Alright that's it. I've tried so many times to solve whatever trumped up issues the character Sanai might have with Nearyku. I've let her kill him twice without hitting back once so that she would be violating pk rules if she keeps coming after me with huge teams and robbing my forge, my ingots, and anything else I drop when I die to worldburn. She's enemied me to the Order of Eloweth, no doubt on some other trumped up charges, and used it to slay me in my forge whileI was Smithing, then Khizan took my ingots and ran. These people are harassing me to the point that I am considering killing every single Khandavian I find, no matter who they are. Khizan, Laerten, Sanai, and a boatload of others have been teaming me every chance they get. She's slain me so many times I'm a level down now, and no one's done anything to stop this disgusting behavior. I tried to solve the problem so many times, challenging her to a duel to end it finally, asking nicely, everything. She is making my experience here a horrendous ordeal. Do something about this blatant disregard for other players and the rules of the game.

It all began when Nearyku randomly slew a friend of Sanai's who was also a Khandavan. After the first death, what followed was a carnival of Nearyku (or in some cases Nearyku's hound) attacking Sanai oftentimes simply for walking past him in some twisted attempt at self-preservation, something that earned him several more deaths. He'd also do things like 'get back from Dis, reject grace, kill Zearion' and somehow be surprised when Sanai appeared to avenge her guildmate's death, or be shocked when Sanai appears to defend her citymate Cardi. As I write this, Nearyku's hound began attacking Sanai when she entered the room with him. All attempts to resolve it beyond Nearyku raging and insisting he was going to 'kill every Khandavan he could find' have been foiled due to his early snubbing, and worldburn was a last resort to flush him out of the forge near Khandavan territory that he uses to continue to make a living with necromantic wares.

From a Khandavan&rsquo;s perspective, the forest, and the Yhurmara where one of Khandava&rsquo;s townes reside is closely guarded.

&ldquo;Nearyku&rsquo;s issue #96647 against you has been dismissed.&rdquo;</p><p>So ends the saga of Nearyku jumping me alone, jumping me 3v1, jumping me 4v1, getting teamed 2v1, getting worldburned out of the Yhumara, getting his hound damaged down to flee range so I could stormhammer it out of the fight at the very beginning, getting his horse damaged down to flee range so I could stormhammer that too, charging me in Khandavan siege and dying to trebuchets, and generally failing.</p><p>Alas. They were good days.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eef50fe9676c8f5aafaaca0e447520ce?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mayena54@xxx on 12 Jun 2010</p><p>@tony</p><p>I&rsquo;ll admit I didn&rsquo;t know the extent of his tomfoolery, but he seems emotionally invested in his character and I think enabling him to continue to associate these emotions with his character is only detrimental for his character (and possibly the typist if he has some sort of anger management issues). Though, I don&rsquo;t think the onus is on the other party to cater to someone&rsquo;s inability to handle a situation in a rational manner, it just seems like it&rsquo;s perpetuating an endless cycle of conflict. And with regards to certain types of players, the conflict becomes exponentially pettier.</p><p>Come on Nearyku how about hugging it out?</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1926e216bda1b3a8c63459c63464bf85?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by ashel@xxx (author) on 12 Jun 2010</p>I fully admit that I have no interest in attempting to end perpetual cycles of conflict, because I love conflict. If he wants to get away from it, the burden is on him. Until then, he dies for every dimwitted thing he does.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fe3436e8bb68a2a8115aa8f399fdcae?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by caziolionblaze@xxx on 14 Jun 2010</p>okay i take my comment back, thats just funny. hahaha</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8106e0cd1ff13ccf41e25834f3b01f19?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by IsaacMole@xxx on 25 Jun 2010</p>Yeah dude was graced, that&rsquo;s why he worldburned.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
