Via Efferus nearing a busy square. (lost) (City of Stavenn.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The hard earth path is
marred by even more wagon tracks nearing the square. As the valley-dwellers 
village looms closer, the awful smell that tinged the faint breeze becomes 
stronger and more pungent, almost to the point of being stifling. To the west, 
the rear portions of the buildings that constitute the main section of the 
village can be seen. The buildings appear to be made of rough-hewn wood, and 
are not at all appealing to the eye. Grass grows in sporadic patches around the
buildings and in most places that it dares to develop it is a sickly 
green-brown color. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on 
the ground. A Diavlous Knight is manning a netthrower here. He has twenty-nine 
nets. Master Mikhael yn&#39;Chionnal, Essence Basher is here, sprawled on the 
ground.

You pause a moment to observe the surrounding area.
To the SOUTHEAST you see:
Passing empty fields along Via Efferus.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A wheeled cannon rests
here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. 
There are 4 corpses of a Diavlous Knight here. An Imperial page is here, a 
small kit tucked securely under one arm. A noble falcon is perched here, its 
bright eyes regarding you watchfully. A massive groomed black stallion stands 
here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. A linseed lies 
here. Twinkling and gleaming, a large pile of golden sovereigns rests on the 
ground. There are 14 cannon balls here. A full-grown rat prowls near your feet.
A pitch-black rat is almost blended into the shadows. Brother Nephi Ashimya is 
here. Arif Jerrik, Disciple of the Dance is here. He holds a buckler in each 
hand. Sir Andun Typhus, Crusader Marshall is here. He wields a strong 
broadsword in his left hand and a dwarven battleaxe in his right. Lord Gerrard 
Ecthellian, Supreme Invoker is riding on an armoured battle stallion. He wields
a strong broadsword in his left hand and an ornate ceremonial longsword in his 
right. Brother Lial, Adherent of Silence is here. Zerin Elarien, Sitara of 
Manoa is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench.
You see exits leading southeast and northwest.

To the WEST you see:
A bustling and dirty village square.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A sewer grate looms 
darkly beneath your feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith
is on the ground. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Mist rises 
from the clear water of an imposing fountain in the middle of the square. A 
stray cat wanders around here, searching the ground for food. Kappa stands here
covered in filth, a brand new longbow in hand.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, northwest, and in.

Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The hard earth path is
marred by even more wagon tracks nearing the square. As the valley-dwellers 
village looms closer, the awful smell that tinged the faint breeze becomes 
stronger and more pungent, almost to the point of being stifling. To the west, 
the rear portions of the buildings that constitute the main section of the 
village can be seen. The buildings appear to be made of rough-hewn wood, and 
are not at all appealing to the eye. Grass grows in sporadic patches around the
buildings and in most places that it dares to develop it is a sickly 
green-brown color. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on

here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.
There are 4 corpses of a Diavlous Knight here. An Imperial page is here, a
small kit tucked securely under one arm. A noble falcon is perched here, its
bright eyes regarding you watchfully. A massive groomed black stallion stands
here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. A linseed lies
here. Twinkling and gleaming, a large pile of golden sovereigns rests on the
ground. There are 14 cannon balls here. A full-grown rat prowls near your feet.

darkly beneath your feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith
is on the ground. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Mist rises
from the clear water of an imposing fountain in the middle of the square. A
stray cat wanders around here, searching the ground for food. Kappa stands here
covered in filth, a brand new longbow in hand.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest,
west, northwest, and in.
