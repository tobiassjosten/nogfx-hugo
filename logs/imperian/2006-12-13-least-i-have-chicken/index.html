You track Forge Master, Lord Drillian Bharathian Falcon Guardian to Before a 
gate of the great desert city of Antioch.
Flying above Before a gate of the great desert city of Antioch.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The sands of the desert give way to a
thick stone wall blocking the view of anything beyond. An arch within wall has 
a carved helm in the keystone. Here and there towers rise above the walls and 
occasionally the the head of someone patrolling the wall can be seen. Opposite 
the desert stretches for what seems an eternity. To the south a range of 
mountains rises to meet the blue sky. The shifting sands below yield 
occasionally to a small weed or cactus. Vision blurs as heat rises from the 
desert sands.
You see exits leading north, northeast, southeast, northwest, and a set of 
ornately wrought, massive gates stand to the southwest (gate open).

desert sands. A large slab of sandstone sits on the side of the road with a 
large WARNING sign chiseled on the side. A tengu hovers gently over the ground 
here. A bald eagle soars about on the thermal currents. Its head tilted 
arrogantly, a salt and pepper gyrfalcon scans the area with a diligent gaze. 
Forge Master, Lord Drillian Bharathian Falcon Guardian is here. He wields a 
truesilver broadsword in each hand. Master Nestaron Agarwaen, Adherent of

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The shifting sands below yield

rise to meet the blue sky. Small plumes of smoke float skywards and a few birds
circle above. Now and then some figures enter or leave through gates in the 
walls heading in different directions. A ragged desert messenger stands here 
impatiently looking lost.
