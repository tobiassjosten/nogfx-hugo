| I made my way to a beautiful spot I had found, out in the     |
| jungles near Stavenn. A man, one I had once found intriguing  |
| approached me out of nowhere. The very same who Elizabell had |
| once offered to instruct me in the art of spanking. At first  |
| he seemed harmless enough. Then he tried to touch me! I do    |
| know him! Why he would feel it was okay to touch a strange    |
| girl after a few brief moments of conversation, I do not know.|
|                                                               |
| I fled, as fast as my legs could carry me. Finding a quiet    |
| spot in the hills. I did not expect the man to follow. Usually|
| they take the hint and leave me be. He did not. He found me   |
| and blocked my only means of escape. He threatened me and     |
| pinned me to the ground when I did not comply with his wishes.|
|                                                               |
| I know that it was futile to try and escape him. I am no      |
| match for one so well versed in the art of combat, but my     |
| stubbornness and foolish fear goaded me to it anyway. His     |
| rough handling convinced me to remain still and listen to his |
| words.                                                        |
|                                                               |
| The man is insane! He thinks he can just kidnap and take what |
| he wants from me. I will not have it. He thinks that with     |
| enough time and enough beatings I&#39;ll come around to his way.  |
|                                                               |
| What fool girl would accept a man who would slice her to bits?|
| Who would accept a brute who would as soon pound her face in  |
| as caress you gently? This man is no man for me, even -if- he |
| had the sense to approach me as a man normally would, with    |
| respect and affection. Not this forced domination and abuse!  |
|                                                               |
| I do not know how I will escape my situation, but I do know I |
| will need to be as brave and as observant as I have ever been.|
| I cannot allow my father even a glimpse of what has happened  |
| to me, nor most of my family.                                 |
|                                                               |
| I must find a way out, either to convince this man of         |
| wrongness in his actions, or escape to where he cannot touch  |
| me.                                                           |
|                                                               |

| He has found his way into my mind, and can command my body.   |
| I have lost control of this situation, if ever I had any.     |
| How do you fight an enemy who can turn your very mind against |
| you?                                                          |
|                                                               |
| The first moment I realized it, how deeply he has sunk his    |
| claws into me, was when he ordered me to return to him. His   |
| cruel nature could not resist ensuring that I could not comply|
| with this command. He left me bound in a cave away from him.  |
| It felt as though I would tear my own limbs off to comply     |
| with the burning drive within me. It was frightening and      |
| more than a little worrisome. But that is not nearly the      |
| worst of what this man has done.                              |
|                                                               |
| Lately, he has taken his pleasure from driving me mad with    |
| hatred, until even the fear of the pain he will inflict drives|
| me to attempt to hurt him. Logically, I know I am no physical |
| match for him, but the hatred burning in my soul will not     |
| allow me to stand idly by while he rambles on about his plans |
| for me. The beatings, the chokings, those wounds apparently   |
| were not enough to sate his appetite for my torment, now he   |
| has turned my mind against me so that the very -thought- of   |
| causing him harm sends this immense pain to my brain. And I   |
| cannot remove it by any means other than changing my thoughts.|
| The sensation is hard to explain, it is as though a thousand  |
| children are being tortured in my head, screeching at the top |
| of their tiny lungs. It hurts me down to my bones, to my soul.|
|                                                               |
| Now he wishes me to steal this man&#39;s heart. I am ordered to   |
| tempt him into loving me, without allowing him my body (as    |
| if that would be a problem, hmph!) How can he even want me    |
| to do this? I thought he wanted to steal my emotions, my      |
| loyalty, my devotion? Now he wishes me to entice another man. |
| Why not order me to pretend to love him? I have no love for   |
| Ilaan. He is a nice man, perhaps. Interesting to speak with.  |
| I do not desire to be his woman, or love him, or be loved by  |
| him. This man confuses me to no end. What is his true purpose |
| in this? What does he really want from me? Certainly not my   |
| body. He could have taken that the way he takes everything    |
| else he wants. My mind, perhaps. He wants my mind, to see me  |
| shattered, a shadow of what I once was. He only thinks that   |
| what he sees he will have if he breaks me, what he fails to   |
| realize is that once I&#39;m broken, I am no longer what he is    |
| drawn to. Perhaps in this lies the key to free myself from    |
| this nightmare.                                               |

QUOTE


Your ally, Sethren Argyle, has entered Imperian.

You stand up from a plush chocolate velvet chair.
                                                   
You tell Archon Dak Lynne, "Greetings, brother."

You tell Archon Dak Lynne, "How do you fare?"

Dak tells you, "Eh - no need to depress you. How do -you- fare?"

You tell Archon Dak Lynne, "I can promise you that I have had better days."

Dak arrives from the northeast.

Your mouth turns up as your face breaks into a smile.

You say, "I see you, brother."

You give Dak a peck on the cheek.

Dak mutters discontentedly.

Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "Better days, eh? What troubles you?"

You say, "I am ... not allowed to have any alcohol. Perhaps we could travel
someplace where I could get a drink and we can have a chat?"

Dak nods his head.

Dak blinks.

Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "What, you think -I- know someplace civilized to eat?
You should know me better than that."

Your eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say, "Then someplace non-civilized."

You say, "Any place that serves beverages, perhaps Celidon?"

Dak nods his head.

-walk to Celidon-

Dak gives a pained sigh.

Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "Bloody lost again - hate caves.."

You cough softly.

You make a beckoning motion to no one in particular.

Archon Dak Lynne is no longer leading you.

Dak begins to follow you.

You grin mischievously at Dak.

Dak rolls his eyes.

A lascivious torture chamber. (lost) (Celidon Council.)
A plush quilt rests here in a welcoming pile of soft material.
You see exits leading up (open door) and down.

You take a seat on a beautiful patchwork quilt.

Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "Fine! Make me look bloody helpless.."

Dak looks about himself suspiciously.

Your eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say to Dak, "This was my home for many years, the council."

You say, "I only recently returned to Stavenn."

Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "So - you are not.. Allowed to have alcohol?"

Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "I cannot imagine that the Wytchen imposed that
restriction on you."

You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.

You say, "No, the wytchen did not. They could not impose any restrictions on
me, anyway."

Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "Who then..?"

Leilani leans forward, tracing lightly the stitching in the quilt beneath her,
"I cannot tell you that, brother," she whispers softly.

Dak&#39;s tail, until now resting quiescent near the floor begins to move to and
fro, the snake-like movements producing a rhythmic rattle.

Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "I would not presume to lie to you and say that I am..
..Alright with that. Someone is casting a shadow on you, and it makes me uneasy
in ways I had forgotten."

Leilani glances up at you, catching your gaze for only a moment. "I do not expect
you to be comfortable with it, brother. But you must know that my telling you
will do neither of us any good. I will be the one to face the consequences, and
you cannot put a stop to it." She sighs softly, her fingertips grazing her neck
as she takes on a distant expression.

Archon Dak Lynne folds his arms slowly across his chest, locking clawed fingers
about armoured biceps. He seems to retreat into himself for a moment,
faceplates contracting into an unreadable expression. He stands there a long
while, mulling over his thoughts, tail rattling. Of a sudden, his face comes to
life again, "Somehow, I do not think you believe what you just told me..".

Leilani narrows her eyes, drawing in a hissing breath, "There is no good that can
come of my telling you, brother. He is one that you must work with. You cannot
harm him. You cannot stop him. If I tell you, then he will hurt me for it, should
he discover that I told you. And, he will know. He finds out everything... even
my own thoughts..." she trails off, blinking back tears that suddenly threaten
to spill. She draws in a deep breath, quickly regaining her composure.

Sethren tells you, "Interesting place, there."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "... it is in my father&#39;s wife&#39;s home."

Sethren tells you, "I trust you&#39;re being good? I&#39;m willing to overlook you not
coming to me when I appeared, if you are."

Archon Dak Lynne emits a long, rapid-fire series of clicks and chatters, the
heavily accented Akrabi underscored by the barely detectable noise of claws
digging furrows into chitin. His face flashes with a pained expression for a
fraction of a second, and he releases the vice grip on his arms, folding them
at the small of his back and speaking up to draw attention away from the glint
of ichorous blood on his fingertips, "Sister - you have trapped me in an
awkward situation."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "I am simply speaking with my half-brother."

Sethren tells you, "-nod-."

Leilani frowns slightly as she regards you with curiosity, "How so?" she asks,
concern echoing in her voice.

Archon Dak Lynne sighs and shoots a quick glance about the room, "I find
myself.. Worried, if you would allow me to make a gross understatement. Seeing
you in such a state, and -often-, is doing nothing good for my temper, and yet
you tell me this.. person, this -dog-, who has done.. Something to you. Many
&#39;somethings&#39;. You tell me he is untouchable, that I cannot feed him my stinger
and watch him choke on my venom as I ache to do right now. I am frustrated,
Sister."

Leilani rubs her temples lightly, her eyes falling closed for a long moment.
"You are a Saboteur, brother. I cannot tell you this man&#39;s name."
Archon Dak Lynne nods his head, once in a shallow and half-hearted manner, and
then a second time with more conviction. "Alright. Alright.. ", he says, more
to himself than you. He gives a resigned sigh and takes a step forward and
places a hand on your shoulder. "You.. You know him, not me. I will take your
word for it."

Leilani stares hard at the floor, "That is for the best," she whispers quietly.
Without warning, her expression seems to brighten,"In other news, brother mine,
I am going to help with Stavenn&#39;s great library!"

Archon Dak Lynne opens his mouth as if to speak, his face going through a
number of expressions, settling on puzzled and finally straightening into its
regular deadpan. He cants his head, "Oh? What have they got you doing,
cataloguing, dusting..?"

You say, "Nothing yet, I go to a meeting for my new role as aide to the Ministry
of Culture. I fully intend to browbeat my way into the upkeep of the library.
Obtaining new tomes for its shelves and encouraging the literary side of our
citizens. I can surround myself in books."

-Dak leaves-


QUOTE



(Stavenn): You say, "Hail Stavenn."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "Hello."

Sethren tells you, "That was quick."

(Stavenn): Esano says, "Hail, Leilani."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "Quick?"

Sethren tells you, "Right after you came, you greeted me."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "That is what you told me to do."

Sethren tells you, "Mhm."

Sethren tells you, "I like that."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "... I did not fancy being smacked around so early in
the day."

Sethren tells you, "Why would you think I&#39;d do that?"

Sethren tells you, "I&#39;d just told you you were good."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "If I had not greeted you right away? Would you still
have had the same opinion?"

Sethren tells you, "Ah. Perhaps not."

You begin writing.You have finished writing.

Sethren Argyle looks around himself, only glancing at you at first.

Leilani dips pen to ink and returns to her writing, chewing on her
lower lip as she concentrates on her tome.

Sethren Argyle lets his eyes rest on you finally, frowning as he notices the
tome. He stays silent, simply watching you write.

Leilani blows gently on the still-wet ink, a slight frown on her face as she
scans over the words, finally satisfied with what she sees, she closes the
tome with a grim expression, shoving it and her ink and pen into the leather
pouch at her waist. As she does, she notices you for the first time, and her
face flushes a bright red as she stammers out, "H-hello there," jumping
quickly to her feet.

You stand up from a white, dove-embroidered blanket.

Sethren Argyle doesn&#39;t say anything, tilting his head curiously at you. His
eyes rest on the pouch at your waist fora moment, then back to your face,
noticing your nervousness. Finally, he speaks "Well, what are you writing about
there, little one?"

Leilani drops her hand to her waist, covering the pouch as she shuffles a few
steps away from you, "Ooh, it&#39;s nothing... a ritual I was working on. Nothing
you would wish to read," she says, her eyes cast to the ground as she stumbles
over her words.

Sethren Argyle smirks slightly, his tail swishing back and forth in annoyance.
"Stop. Your fear is amusing and all..but I wouldn&#39;t advise trying to get away
from me. Now, what did you really write? I know that you would not be writing a
ritual, you have other..things..to do." Despite his irritation, he makes no
sudden moves, but the way he stands gives away that he is ready to.

Leilani trembling softly, her hand clutching her tome tightly through it&#39;s leather
encasing. She whispers quietly, "I was writing... just a few silly thoughts, the
things a young girl writes. You do not need to see such pointless drivel," as she
takes another step backward.

A dark shadow creeping across its face, the blood red moon of Terror forces the
stars around it to dull themselves.

Sethren Argyle rolls his eyes, suddenly lunging forward and grabbing hold of
your arm, yanking you to the ground. He still holds on to your arm, though,
making sure you&#39;re kept still. "I told you to stop, didn&#39;t I? Stop trying to
avoid it. I bet..you&#39;ve been writing in it constantly, and not telling me about
it." Staring down at you, he appears to be a little more than annoyed.

Leilani winces as you lunge for her, a small cry torn from her lips as she hits
the floor, trembling violently, "I... wrote... yes. Some of my thoughts..." she
whispers, her head hung low.

Sethren Argyle crouches down in front of you, stroking your hair with his other
hand, with an odd tenderness. He leans in to you, whispering, "Just give me the
tome, and everything will be okay. I won&#39;t punish you if you simply let me read
it." He smiles slightly, seeming to be entirely sincere.

Leilani frowns slightly, her eyes darting up to meet your own. "You will... not
take it from me..." she whispers nervously, her hand still clutching tightly to
the tome.

Sethren Argyle shakes his head, the smile still remaining on his lips. "I would
never take it from you, as long as you let me see it. I can&#39;t blame you for
disobeying me in that manner, I know how important it is to you." His tail
sways slowly behind him in a relaxed way, showing nothing of the earlier
tension.

You give a thick, musty tome to Sethren Argyle.

Leilani nervously pulls her tome from the pouch, and hands it to you, unwilling
to let go for a long moment. She stares helplessly at you as you pull it from her
grasp, and seems to shrink where she sits, blinking back tears.

Sethren Argyle stares down at the tome, expressionless as he reads.

Leilani shuffles nervously, wringing her hands together as her eyes dart around
the room.

Sethren Argyle closes the tome, making no move to return it, simply looking at
you calmly. "Hm..interesting. You&#39;ve been writing quite a bit, it seems. And
perhaps I have more work to do with you than I thought. But..hm.." He narrows
his eyes slightly, "A trick up your sleeve?"

Leilani winces slightly, drawing in a hissing breath as she scoots back, still
on her knees before you, "I...it was nothing, I told you..just the ramblings
of a silly girl," she sputters out, breathlessly. "Please, can I have it back
now," she asks, her voice full of rising panic.

Sethren Argyle pauses, as if considering. His lips move into a slightly
vicious-looking smile, "No." He watches you carefully, hands moving in front of
him over the tome.

Leilani blinks back the tears that rise suddenly, "Why...you promised! Give it
back to me!" she pleads. Her hands are clenched into tight little fists, long
nails digging into the fleshy palms, cutting little half moon marks into the skin.

Sethren Argyle shakes his head. "That was before I read it, I&#39;m not in such a
forgiving mood now. Stand up, need to do something, but I want you to come
along." He rises to his feet, offering his hand to help you up.

Leilani stands on her own, glowering miserably at your offered hand.
You begin to follow Sethren.

You follow Sethren to the west.

-walking-

You follow Sethren to the south.

Ansol, the Imperial Executioner says, "My halberd grows hungry, I hope you
bring me someone soon, Sethren."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Light from above shines into this large, glass enclosed atrium, illuminating a
towering scaffold of bone-white wood. The scaffold has been made with mass
death in mind, long enough to hang a dozen criminals at a time and sturdy
enough to last for many decades. Against the far marble wall is an executioners
block, made from what appears to be the stump of a great redwood. Its surface
covered in nicks and stained with the blood of thousands of deaths. Room for
spectators has been allowed around the executioners block and the scaffold, the
best areas reserved with cushioned marble benches for the nobility. An archway
leads into the last chambers of the Iudicatus Castigatio, the torture chambers.
A tall case made from onyx stands center room, its panels of glass glinting
from the slightest light. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil.
Presiding with fearful dominance over the surroundings is the frightful form of
the executioner&#39;s gallows, ropes swinging with mocking implication of
disobedience to the Empire. A large slate stone stands ominously, riddled with
dark crimson stains and sharp slashed gouges riddling its surface. A thin
parchment scroll has been tacked to a far wall. A sigil in the shape of a
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An obsidian halberd at the ready,
an executioner stands here, his eyes gleaming with an eerie greed.
You see exits leading north and south (closed door).

You whisper to Sethren, "...I ... I am sorry. I promise... I will tell you
whenever I write from now on..."

Sethren whispers to you, "It isn&#39;t for you, I wouldn&#39;t kill you."

Leilani sighs in relief, the tension easing a bit from her face.

that looks like a stick man has been sketched into the ground here. A pike with

Lyn gives a pained sigh.

Vijay turns his head to the right and scratches under his chin with his rear
right paw.

Sethren beckons Lyn to him.

Areni, Spirit of the Wilds says something beyond understanding in a sequence of
barks, whines, and growls.

Sethren Argyle says, "Best to get it over with."

Lyn nods her head.

(Stavenn): Sethren says, "Anyone interested in witnessing an execution? You&#39;ll
need to come now."

Breav nods slowly.

| I made my way to a beautiful spot I had found, out in the |
| jungles near Stavenn. A man, one I had once found intriguing |
| approached me out of nowhere. The very same who Elizabell had |
| once offered to instruct me in the art of spanking. At first |
| he seemed harmless enough. Then he tried to touch me! I do |
| know him! Why he would feel it was okay to touch a strange |
| girl after a few brief moments of conversation, I do not know.|
| |
| I fled, as fast as my legs could carry me. Finding a quiet |
| spot in the hills. I did not expect the man to follow. Usually|
| they take the hint and leave me be. He did not. He found me |
| and blocked my only means of escape. He threatened me and |
| pinned me to the ground when I did not comply with his wishes.|
| |
| I know that it was futile to try and escape him. I am no |
| match for one so well versed in the art of combat, but my |
| stubbornness and foolish fear goaded me to it anyway. His |
| rough handling convinced me to remain still and listen to his |
| words. |
| |
| The man is insane! He thinks he can just kidnap and take what |
| he wants from me. I will not have it. He thinks that with |
| enough time and enough beatings I'll come around to his way. |
| |
| What fool girl would accept a man who would slice her to bits?|
| Who would accept a brute who would as soon pound her face in |
| as caress you gently? This man is no man for me, even -if- he |
| had the sense to approach me as a man normally would, with |
| respect and affection. Not this forced domination and abuse! |
| |
| I do not know how I will escape my situation, but I do know I |
| will need to be as brave and as observant as I have ever been.|
| I cannot allow my father even a glimpse of what has happened |
| to me, nor most of my family. |
| |
| I must find a way out, either to convince this man of |
| wrongness in his actions, or escape to where he cannot touch |
| me. |

| |
| He has found his way into my mind, and can command my body. |
| I have lost control of this situation, if ever I had any. |
| How do you fight an enemy who can turn your very mind against |
| you? |
| |
| The first moment I realized it, how deeply he has sunk his |
| claws into me, was when he ordered me to return to him. His |
| cruel nature could not resist ensuring that I could not comply|
| with this command. He left me bound in a cave away from him. |
| It felt as though I would tear my own limbs off to comply |
| with the burning drive within me. It was frightening and |
| more than a little worrisome. But that is not nearly the |
| worst of what this man has done. |
| |
| Lately, he has taken his pleasure from driving me mad with |
| hatred, until even the fear of the pain he will inflict drives|
| me to attempt to hurt him. Logically, I know I am no physical |
| match for him, but the hatred burning in my soul will not |
| allow me to stand idly by while he rambles on about his plans |
| for me. The beatings, the chokings, those wounds apparently |
| were not enough to sate his appetite for my torment, now he |
| has turned my mind against me so that the very -thought- of |
| causing him harm sends this immense pain to my brain. And I |
| cannot remove it by any means other than changing my thoughts.|
| The sensation is hard to explain, it is as though a thousand |
| children are being tortured in my head, screeching at the top |
| of their tiny lungs. It hurts me down to my bones, to my soul.|
| |
| Now he wishes me to steal this man's heart. I am ordered to |
| tempt him into loving me, without allowing him my body (as |
| if that would be a problem, hmph!) How can he even want me |
| to do this? I thought he wanted to steal my emotions, my |
| loyalty, my devotion? Now he wishes me to entice another man. |
| Why not order me to pretend to love him? I have no love for |
| Ilaan. He is a nice man, perhaps. Interesting to speak with. |
| I do not desire to be his woman, or love him, or be loved by |
| him. This man confuses me to no end. What is his true purpose |
| in this? What does he really want from me? Certainly not my |
| body. He could have taken that the way he takes everything |
| else he wants. My mind, perhaps. He wants my mind, to see me |
| shattered, a shadow of what I once was. He only thinks that |
| what he sees he will have if he breaks me, what he fails to |
| realize is that once I'm broken, I am no longer what he is |
| drawn to. Perhaps in this lies the key to free myself from |
| this nightmare. |

QUOTE
Your ally, Sethren Argyle, has entered Imperian.
You stand up from a plush chocolate velvet chair.
You tell Archon Dak Lynne, "Greetings, brother."
You tell Archon Dak Lynne, "How do you fare?"
Dak tells you, "Eh - no need to depress you. How do -you- fare?"
You tell Archon Dak Lynne, "I can promise you that I have had better days."
Dak arrives from the northeast.
Your mouth turns up as your face breaks into a smile.
You say, "I see you, brother."
You give Dak a peck on the cheek.
Dak mutters discontentedly.
Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "Better days, eh? What troubles you?"
You say, "I am ... not allowed to have any alcohol. Perhaps we could travel
someplace where I could get a drink and we can have a chat?"
Dak nods his head.
Dak blinks.
Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "What, you think -I- know someplace civilized to eat?
You should know me better than that."
Your eyes sparkle with amusement.
You say, "Then someplace non-civilized."
You say, "Any place that serves beverages, perhaps Celidon?"
Dak nods his head.
-walk to Celidon-
Dak gives a pained sigh.
Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "Bloody lost again - hate caves.."
You cough softly.
You make a beckoning motion to no one in particular.
Archon Dak Lynne is no longer leading you.
Dak begins to follow you.
You grin mischievously at Dak.
Dak rolls his eyes.
A lascivious torture chamber. (lost) (Celidon Council.)
A plush quilt rests here in a welcoming pile of soft material.
You see exits leading up (open door) and down.
You take a seat on a beautiful patchwork quilt.
Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "Fine! Make me look bloody helpless.."
Dak looks about himself suspiciously.
Your eyes sparkle with amusement.
You say to Dak, "This was my home for many years, the council."
You say, "I only recently returned to Stavenn."
Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "So - you are not.. Allowed to have alcohol?"
Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "I cannot imagine that the Wytchen imposed that
restriction on you."
You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.
You say, "No, the wytchen did not. They could not impose any restrictions on
me, anyway."
Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "Who then..?"
Leilani leans forward, tracing lightly the stitching in the quilt beneath her,
"I cannot tell you that, brother," she whispers softly.
Dak's tail, until now resting quiescent near the floor begins to move to and
fro, the snake-like movements producing a rhythmic rattle.
Archon Dak Lynne snarls, "I would not presume to lie to you and say that I am..
..Alright with that. Someone is casting a shadow on you, and it makes me uneasy
in ways I had forgotten."
Leilani glances up at you, catching your gaze for only a moment. "I do not expect
you to be comfortable with it, brother. But you must know that my telling you
will do neither of us any good. I will be the one to face the consequences, and
you cannot put a stop to it." She sighs softly, her fingertips grazing her neck
as she takes on a distant expression.
Archon Dak Lynne folds his arms slowly across his chest, locking clawed fingers
about armoured biceps. He seems to retreat into himself for a moment,
faceplates contracting into an unreadable expression. He stands there a long
while, mulling over his thoughts, tail rattling. Of a sudden, his face comes to
life again, "Somehow, I do not think you believe what you just told me..".
Leilani narrows her eyes, drawing in a hissing breath, "There is no good that can
come of my telling you, brother. He is one that you must work with. You cannot
harm him. You cannot stop him. If I tell you, then he will hurt me for it, should
he discover that I told you. And, he will know. He finds out everything... even
my own thoughts..." she trails off, blinking back tears that suddenly threaten
to spill. She draws in a deep breath, quickly regaining her composure.
Sethren tells you, "Interesting place, there."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "... it is in my father's wife's home."
Sethren tells you, "I trust you're being good? I'm willing to overlook you not
coming to me when I appeared, if you are."
Archon Dak Lynne emits a long, rapid-fire series of clicks and chatters, the
heavily accented Akrabi underscored by the barely detectable noise of claws
digging furrows into chitin. His face flashes with a pained expression for a
fraction of a second, and he releases the vice grip on his arms, folding them
at the small of his back and speaking up to draw attention away from the glint
of ichorous blood on his fingertips, "Sister - you have trapped me in an
awkward situation."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "I am simply speaking with my half-brother."
Sethren tells you, "-nod-."
Leilani frowns slightly as she regards you with curiosity, "How so?" she asks,
concern echoing in her voice.
Archon Dak Lynne sighs and shoots a quick glance about the room, "I find
myself.. Worried, if you would allow me to make a gross understatement. Seeing
you in such a state, and -often-, is doing nothing good for my temper, and yet
you tell me this.. person, this -dog-, who has done.. Something to you. Many
'somethings'. You tell me he is untouchable, that I cannot feed him my stinger
and watch him choke on my venom as I ache to do right now. I am frustrated,
Sister."
Leilani rubs her temples lightly, her eyes falling closed for a long moment.
"You are a Saboteur, brother. I cannot tell you this man's name."
Archon Dak Lynne nods his head, once in a shallow and half-hearted manner, and
then a second time with more conviction. "Alright. Alright.. ", he says, more
to himself than you. He gives a resigned sigh and takes a step forward and
places a hand on your shoulder. "You.. You know him, not me. I will take your
word for it."
Leilani stares hard at the floor, "That is for the best," she whispers quietly.
Without warning, her expression seems to brighten,"In other news, brother mine,
I am going to help with Stavenn's great library!"
Archon Dak Lynne opens his mouth as if to speak, his face going through a
number of expressions, settling on puzzled and finally straightening into its
regular deadpan. He cants his head, "Oh? What have they got you doing,
cataloguing, dusting..?"
You say, "Nothing yet, I go to a meeting for my new role as aide to the Ministry
of Culture. I fully intend to browbeat my way into the upkeep of the library.
Obtaining new tomes for its shelves and encouraging the literary side of our
citizens. I can surround myself in books."
-Dak leaves-

(Stavenn): You say, "Hail Stavenn."

Sethren tells you, "That was quick."
(Stavenn): Esano says, "Hail, Leilani."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "Quick?"
Sethren tells you, "Right after you came, you greeted me."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "That is what you told me to do."
Sethren tells you, "Mhm."
Sethren tells you, "I like that."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "... I did not fancy being smacked around so early in
the day."
Sethren tells you, "Why would you think I'd do that?"
Sethren tells you, "I'd just told you you were good."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "If I had not greeted you right away? Would you still
have had the same opinion?"
Sethren tells you, "Ah. Perhaps not."
You begin writing.You have finished writing.
Sethren Argyle looks around himself, only glancing at you at first.
Leilani dips pen to ink and returns to her writing, chewing on her
lower lip as she concentrates on her tome.
Sethren Argyle lets his eyes rest on you finally, frowning as he notices the
tome. He stays silent, simply watching you write.
Leilani blows gently on the still-wet ink, a slight frown on her face as she
scans over the words, finally satisfied with what she sees, she closes the
tome with a grim expression, shoving it and her ink and pen into the leather
pouch at her waist. As she does, she notices you for the first time, and her
face flushes a bright red as she stammers out, "H-hello there," jumping
quickly to her feet.
You stand up from a white, dove-embroidered blanket.
Sethren Argyle doesn't say anything, tilting his head curiously at you. His

it." He smiles slightly, seeming to be entirely sincere.

Sethren Argyle pauses, as if considering. His lips move into a slightly

Leilani blinks back the tears that rise suddenly, "Why...you promised! Give it
