   Being displeased with the performance of Vanmoriel Sa&#39;Gael,

   vote of no confidence has been called. The following individuals
   believe they can better perform the duties required of the
   position.

Choices:
     1.  (28) Vanmoriel
     2.  (19) Kinuma

(Kinsarmar): Elrith says, "Can democracy really be discussed like that? Doesn&#39;t it just mean that what most people voted on won?"

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "In other places electins are followed by people  being thrown out there city, and elections often start with people murdering  each other."

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "Even if we in the city contest to often, our 
populace is intelligent, civil, and well informed."

(Kinsarmar): Elrith says, "Sounds like a working democracy to me."

Kinuma got a lot of votes for an election but  somehow vanmoriel got even more. It seems to always be like that for her and  Ivellios. it&#39;s amazing how so many people that are normally dormant tend to  wake only when Vanmoriel or Ivellios are being contested.

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "No matter how many elections Vanmoriel or Ivellios win, some very in-proper accusation is lobbied that makes the election seem a  fraud.

EVEN if you see them awake they are not voting."
