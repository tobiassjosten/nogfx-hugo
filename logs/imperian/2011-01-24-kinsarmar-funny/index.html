Description:
   Being displeased with the performance of Vanmoriel Sa&#39;Gael,

   vote of no confidence has been called. The following individuals
   believe they can better perform the duties required of the
   position.

Choices:
     1.  (28) Vanmoriel
     2.  (19) Kinuma
     3.  (4) Sadey
     4.  (3) Runi

(Kinsarmar): Mikihide says, "Ha."

(Kinsarmar): Elrith says, "Can democracy really be discussed like that? Doesn&#39;t it just mean that what most people voted on won?"

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "In other places electins are followed by people  being thrown out there city, and elections often start with people murdering  each other."

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "Even if we in the city contest to often, our 
populace is intelligent, civil, and well informed."

(Kinsarmar): Elrith says, "Sounds like a working democracy to me."

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "I am very happy and proud to be a part of it."

(Kinsarmar): Ruwin says, "Funny, I don&#39;t think we even have fifty four active  citizens and if we do half of those cannot likely vote since we have had a  recent influx of new citizens. Kinuma got a lot of votes for an election but  somehow vanmoriel got even more. It seems to always be like that for her and  Ivellios. it&#39;s amazing how so many people that are normally dormant tend to  wake only when Vanmoriel or Ivellios are being contested. One begins to wonder  after it happens so many times."

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "And so we have the issue."

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "No matter how many elections Vanmoriel or Ivellios win, some very in-proper accusation is lobbied that makes the election seem a  fraud.

EVEN if you see them awake they are not voting."

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "Lets get together and makes things friendlier and  better in the city instead." 


(Kinsarmar): Ruwin says, "Whatever you say Insinyan. I am not the only or the  first to wonder."

(Kinsarmar): Insinyan says, "Our government is relativly young."
