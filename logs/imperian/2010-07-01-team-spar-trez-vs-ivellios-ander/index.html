Ander's knife leaves a curving vision trail as it speeds into you, cutting a ravaged swath through your flesh.
The final blow is too much for you, and you fall to the floor a broken, bloody mess.
You have been slain by Ander.
You are OUT of the Team Spar!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
There are 2 beehives here. A fiery Shaahri mare trots about. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and
aloofness. The large body of a white polar bear stands here dominating the room.
You see a single exit leading down.
Ander and Ivellios have defeated Trez in a Team Spar in the Coliseum.
Ivellios arrives from the ether.
You sense through your hound that Ivellios has entered the area.
[Ivellios - Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.]
Your senses flare as a luminous green image drifts in from the ether, its appearance sharpening to reveal Ander.
He is followed by a savage grey wolf.
Your foreboding stone glows, warning you that Ander is nearby.
You sense through your hound that Ander has entered the area.
[Ander - Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.]
Ander quickly flows into the Ein-Fasit stance.

aloofness. The large body of a white polar bear stands here dominating the room. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. A fetid stench informs you that a colossal one-eyed hound is here. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes
gazing upon you. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Rais Ruquba Ander is here. He wields an ivory sitara
