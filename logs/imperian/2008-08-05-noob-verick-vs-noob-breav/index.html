Abrupt end at a chasm. (road). (Northwest Arena.)
A gaping hole is all that is left of the path, which seems to have suddenly 
collapsed here. It's quite clear that some sort of major natural event caused 
the collapse of an entire section of the arena. A faint path can be picked out 
amongst the rubble leading under the ground. Little plant life grows here; the 
rock and gravel prevents much from taking root. Dripping with blood, an 
inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The
shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from 
out of the darkness. Breav Argyle, Occultist of Atrophy is riding on a black 
ouroboros. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a wicked-looking 
daegger in his right.
You see exits leading north and down.

inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The
shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from

rock and gravel prevents much from taking root. Dripping with blood, an
inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The
shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from
out of the darkness. Eyes darting nervously, a silver chinchilla scurries
around your feet. A woolly yak stands here placidly, searching for more foliage

ambush breav
Rock covered cave. (Southwestern Arena.)
The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is
littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another
path in the southeast of this chamber.
You see exits leading east, southeast, and up.
H:212 M:272 E:815 W:1216 &lt;eb db>
You launch yourself at Breav Argyle, Occultist of Atrophy with a roar.
Abrupt end at a chasm. (road).
A gaping hole is all that is left of the path, which seems to have suddenly
collapsed here. It's quite clear that some sort of major natural event caused
the collapse of an entire section of the arena. A faint path can be picked out
amongst the rubble leading under the ground. Little plant life grows here; the
rock and gravel prevents much from taking root. Dripping with blood, an
inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The
shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from
out of the darkness. A gladiator's trident lies here waiting to be used. A
large cylindrical shield is propped nearby. Breav Argyle, Occultist of Atrophy
is riding on a black ouroboros. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a
wicked-looking daegger in his right.
You see exits leading north and down.
You knock Breav to the ground, tearing at him with teeth and claws.

Rubble-filled path around the arena. (road).
The walls of the arena have nearly completely collapsed here, spilling rubble
across the path that winds around the arena. Patches of weeds poke up through
cracked sections of the hard rock of the path, while trees seem to be
encroaching closer to the boundaries of the path as hard tree roots push their
implacable bulk under the ground. The path continues to the south but it seems
