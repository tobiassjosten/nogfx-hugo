Voice - Resonance

Syntax: RESONATE <CHI/TA/WE/NOTHING>

Your skill in Voice is now such that you can attune your words of power to one 
of the several primordial notes. Doing so increases the effect of your power 
words in various ways.

Each time you successfully hit a player with a power word, while resonating any
of these three notes, the target\&#39;s body will start vibrating in tune with that 
note. As you keep attacking the target, the vibrations will increase.

The resonant vibrations will not last indefinitely - the effect will slowly 
wear off over time and will eventually fade entirely, if you do not maintain 
your offense against the individual.

It is important to note that resonance will have no effect if the target is 
shielded. In that case, the power word will still affect the target, but with 
the regular effectivity.

There are three primordial notes that affect power words:
Chi: Allows you to sing Voice words faster. The effect depends on how much the 
target is resonating with the Chi note.

<332/286h 424/424m 1334e 2021w <eb> <d>> more
Ta: This note increases the effect of certain power words, as listed below.
We: If the target is sufficiently resonating with the We note, your power words
will bypass deafness.

The Ta note affects the following power words:
Shaite/Rubait: increased damage
Llan: more health restored
Myried: longer stun
Kawis: bypasses levitation entirely if sufficiently resonating
Nuarinyu: chance to hit with two affliction instead of one, higher resonance 
means higher chance
The other power words are unaffected.

Kinsarmar Crossroads. [City of Kinsarmar.][103]
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A sewer grate looms
darkly beneath your feet. An unadorned bench of green marble sits here. Violet
fire ripples over a tall obelisk of solid crystal, set into the very center of
the crossroad. No bigger than a dwarf, a tiny marble fountain of a cherubim has
been placed here. A slender depiction in silver has been placed here, a
resplendent sculpture of the Lady of the Arcane. An obsidian eye sigil is here.
A tiny, sprouting sapling lies on the ground here. A delicate windchime hangs
here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. Weathered and flaking, this lump of coal
crumbles easily. Wrapped with silver ribbon, a sparkling bag of golden silk
rests upon the ground here, topped with bow. A linseed lies here. A headless
corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. A headless corpse, devoid of identity,

mustang of blood-red colouring prances here, with eyes of silvery starlight.
Barely registering your presence, a stealthy cougar stalks the area. A tiny dog
with a profusion of springy curls upon her head and tail is running around in
circles here. An elite Lorekeeper Knight is manning a cannon here. He has
eleven cannon balls. A strawberry-roan mare stands here, fidgeting impatiently
as she occasionally noses at nearby objects. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon
coat, a massive shire stands here poised and alert. A fragile little bird with
blush-coloured feathers is perched here, warbling a lovely tune. A black and
white striped Paran zebra roams warily here, alert to any movement. There are 6
elite Sidhe Skywatchers here. A Lorekeeper Knight stands here, twin runed
blades at his sides. A lean coyote prowls around the area, his nose sniffing
along the ground for prey. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive
woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Calmly gazing upon
her surroundings with ice blue eyes, a healthy white mare stands here upon
strong legs. Hovering in the air is a vibrant vermilion songbird, wings
a-flutter. A small white dove sits here, watching any movement made with a
cautious eye. Jalie is here, a blank look in her eyes. Risca Arivan is here. He
wields a set of polished panpipes in his left hand and a beechwood mandolin in
his right. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Greggory, Aspect of
Aryana. Sir Kurayami Lorianis, Runic Quartermaster is riding on a vicious
smoke-blue stallion. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a golden
bladed sabre in his right.

edges. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. An elegant white letter
is in danger of being soiled here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular
monolith is on the ground. Catching any speck of light, a glittering ball is
hanging from a wooden pole here. An elite Lorekeeper Knight is manning a cannon
here. He has fifty cannon balls. A massive groomed black stallion stands here
proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. Walking with grace, a
slender muscular hound paces about, constantly sniffing the air. His powerful
form dominating the area, this impressive buckskin stallion stands with an air
of confidence about him. A short-legged and chunky hound sniffs at the air
here. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a massive shire stands here

Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Bound in majestic
black leather, the crest of Kinsarmar embossed upon the surface in purest
silver, a tome rests here upon a stately oak pedestal. A small oil lamp made of
tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. There are 2
monolith sigils here. A massive bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands
of foam hanging from its muzzle. An elite Lorekeeper Knight is manning a cannon
here. He has forty-nine cannon balls. A grizzled old rat sits here, fearlessly.

suspended with a crystal of pure amethyst. A welcoming marble statue rests
here, prominently displaying three figures as a protective symbol to Kinsarmar.
The shrunken head of Braefer has been staked into the ground here, the last
torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Dyanea has

Voice - Resonance
Syntax: RESONATE &lt;CHI/TA/WE/NOTHING>
Your skill in Voice is now such that you can attune your words of power to one
of the several primordial notes. Doing so increases the effect of your power
words in various ways.
Each time you successfully hit a player with a power word, while resonating any
of these three notes, the target\'s body will start vibrating in tune with that
note. As you keep attacking the target, the vibrations will increase.
The resonant vibrations will not last indefinitely - the effect will slowly
wear off over time and will eventually fade entirely, if you do not maintain
your offense against the individual.
It is important to note that resonance will have no effect if the target is
shielded. In that case, the power word will still affect the target, but with
the regular effectivity.
There are three primordial notes that affect power words:
Chi: Allows you to sing Voice words faster. The effect depends on how much the
target is resonating with the Chi note.

&lt;332/286h 424/424m 1334e 2021w &lt;eb> &lt;d>> more
Ta: This note increases the effect of certain power words, as listed below.
We: If the target is sufficiently resonating with the We note, your power words
will bypass deafness.
The Ta note affects the following power words:
Shaite/Rubait: increased damage
Llan: more health restored
Myried: longer stun
Kawis: bypasses levitation entirely if sufficiently resonating
Nuarinyu: chance to hit with two affliction instead of one, higher resonance
means higher chance
The other power words are unaffected.
