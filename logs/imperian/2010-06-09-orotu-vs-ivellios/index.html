Disintegrated underground wall. (Southwestern Arena.)
The wall of the arena has sunken far into the ground here, broken up into a variety of pieces. Parts of the wall seem to stand, pressed into the hard mud of the underground chamber, while other parts of it litter the ground in varying states of disrepair and ruin. Various forms of moss and other underground growth have crept over both the pieces of the wall and the remaining sections of it still standing, while tree roots line the ceiling. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Dirgesinger Ivellios Eldris, Binder of Words is here. He wields a small silver flute in his left hand and a beechwood mandolin in his right. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.

The wall of the arena has sunken far into the ground here, broken up into a variety of pieces. Parts of the wall seem to stand, pressed into the hard mud of the underground chamber, while other parts of it litter the ground in varying states of disrepair and ruin. Various forms of moss and other underground growth have crept over both the pieces of the wall and the remaining sections of it still standing, while tree roots line the ceiling. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A small axe lies here, discarded. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes.

Disintegrated underground wall. (Southwestern Arena.)
The wall of the arena has sunken far into the ground here, broken up into a variety of pieces. Parts of the wall seem to stand, pressed into the hard mud of the underground chamber, while other parts of it litter the ground in varying states of disrepair and ruin. Various forms of moss and other underground growth have crept over both the pieces of the wall and the remaining sections of it still standing, while tree roots line the ceiling. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Dirgesinger Ivellios Eldris, Binder of Words is here. He wields a small silver flute in his left hand and a beechwood mandolin in his right. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and northwest.

Disintegrated underground wall. (Southwestern Arena.)
The wall of the arena has sunken far into the ground here, broken up into a variety of pieces. Parts of the wall seem to stand, pressed into the hard mud of the underground chamber, while other parts of it litter the ground in varying states of disrepair and ruin. Various forms of moss and other underground growth have crept over both the pieces of the wall and the remaining sections of it still standing, while tree roots line the ceiling. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A small axe lies here, discarded. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A nearly perfect sketch of a black fern floats in midair here. Dirgesinger Ivellios Eldris, Binder of Words is here. He is holding a tower shield in his left hand.
