Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
once grand market square of ancient Caanae surrounds this centralized point, 
where the ground has been shaken and torn apart by a catastrophic event. Three 
meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic scripts lie collapsed upon the 
ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean askew to one side of the stone
pile, blocking the view from outside of all the wonders housed within this 
temple. Barely standing under the weight of a pillar is a marble altar, which 
has been etched with scars and scratches from the passage of time and elements.
The structure of the pillars silently displays how it was once a small but 
impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar indicate it to have been 
built in honor of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the cracks in the centre is a 
passage of pure water, perhaps the purest known in the realm of Aetherius. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
large cylindrical shield is propped nearby. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. A small sign points into a market stall. An elegant
white letter is in danger of being soiled here. Ooze leaks from the body of a 
red and black striped centipede. Lying at your feet is a bloodied and mangled 
arm, still warm and throbbing with life. Barely more than grinning skull 
suspended in the air by ethereal energy, a lost soul floats aimlessly about 
here. There are 2 lost souls here. A mess of red and black is all that remains 
of what once was a cat. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and
alert. Scavenger Ithrana is here. Kheoss Nessaja DeviSeer, Squire of Blood is 
here, shrouded. He wields a curved sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

(Newbie): Aoede says, &#34;If you happen to get lost, you can do several things. To
find out where you are, check SURVEY, which gives you alot of helpful 
information. There is also HELP LANDMARKS, perhaps you are near a landmark that
you know! Or if you do not wish to find your way, you can use PORTALS. Using 
PORTALS will bring you to a ring of Portals which lead to many helpful places 
in the world. However at Level 11, you have only 20 portals to your name, and 
at level 21 any portals you have remaining are gone, for you will no longer be

l
Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The
once grand market square of ancient Caanae surrounds this centralized point,
where the ground has been shaken and torn apart by a catastrophic event. Three
meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic scripts lie collapsed upon the
ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean askew to one side of the stone
pile, blocking the view from outside of all the wonders housed within this
temple. Barely standing under the weight of a pillar is a marble altar, which
has been etched with scars and scratches from the passage of time and elements.
The structure of the pillars silently displays how it was once a small but
impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar indicate it to have been
built in honor of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the cracks in the centre is a
passage of pure water, perhaps the purest known in the realm of Aetherius. The
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved statue of light
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A
large cylindrical shield is propped nearby. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his
gaze cast over the Springs. A small sign points into a market stall. An elegant
white letter is in danger of being soiled here. Ooze leaks from the body of a
red and black striped centipede. Lying at your feet is a bloodied and mangled
arm, still warm and throbbing with life. Barely more than grinning skull
suspended in the air by ethereal energy, a lost soul floats aimlessly about
here. There are 2 lost souls here. A mess of red and black is all that remains
of what once was a cat. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and
alert. Scavenger Ithrana is here. Kheoss Nessaja DeviSeer, Squire of Blood is
here, shrouded. He wields a curved sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway
leads down.

find out where you are, check SURVEY, which gives you alot of helpful
information. There is also HELP LANDMARKS, perhaps you are near a landmark that
you know! Or if you do not wish to find your way, you can use PORTALS. Using
PORTALS will bring you to a ring of Portals which lead to many helpful places
in the world. However at Level 11, you have only 20 portals to your name, and
at level 21 any portals you have remaining are gone, for you will no longer be
