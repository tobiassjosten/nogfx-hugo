Dry grasslands near mountains. (road). (Western Nolmine Heights.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. Tramping along the road, you begin to feel a bit whimsical and decide 
to try your hand at walking it with your eyes closed. You can feel the 
smoothness of the highway beneath your feet and the slow movement of air 
ruffles your hair. When you open your eyes to take a quick peek, you find that 
you don't know if you are going the same way as before or not, everything looks
uniform on both sides of you and the road itself gives no clue as to which way 
you were going. Shrugging your shoulders you pick a direction, resolving to 
stay focused on the journey from now on. Delver of the Depths, Meruchakri 
Da'Saison, Alente's Trident is here, hidden.

Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. Northwest and east the highway rolls, a thin link to connect a 
continent. While you usually take for granted the luxury of being able to have 
this track to ease your journey, for some reason the thought of the years of 
labor and the dedication of the workers that were needed to erect it settles 
into your mind. You pause in your journey, here amid the grasses, to give a 
silent thanks for those who passed before you and eased your way. That silent 
moment leaves you uplifted for many miles. A fairly large group of prickly 
pears lies discarded here. There are 4 pieces of kelp in 4 groups here. There 
are 6 maidenhair leaves in 6 groups here. Some hyssop stem is discarded here. A

North of Nolmine Heights. (road). (lost) (Western Nolmine Heights.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Northwest and east the
highway rolls, a thin link to connect a continent. While you usually take for 
granted the luxury of being able to have this track to ease your journey, for 
some reason the thought of the years of labor and the dedication of the workers
that were needed to erect it settles into your mind. You pause in your journey,
here amid the grasses, to give a silent thanks for those who passed before you 
and eased your way. That silent moment leaves you uplifted for many miles. A 
fairly large group of prickly pears lies discarded here. There are 4 pieces of 
kelp in 4 groups here. There are 6 maidenhair leaves in 6 groups here. Some 
hyssop stem is discarded here. A ripe quince fruit lies here. Hovering in the 
air and singing a sweet melody is a brilliantly coloured bluebird. Huge eyes 
gleaming luminously an eagle owl perches nearby. Chittering madly, a 
ring-tailed raccoon darts furtively about underfoot. Massive and immovable as 
an iceberg, a tundra bear stands proudly here. Eyes glinting with bloodlust, an
arctic wolf prowls here. Sniffing at the wind curiously, a small white fox 
pauses here. A bald eagle soars about on the thermal currents. Preening her 
wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. Silent and observant, a red 
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Poised 
nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. Wings outstretched
to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Hackles raised, 
an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Nervously pacing, a small brown 
lemming scampers under your feet. Arvanian Kwindan is here, hidden. Sentinel 
Gurn Tellaris, Woodland's Vindication is here, hidden. Delver of the Depths, 
Meruchakri Da'Saison, Alente's Trident is here, hidden.

A narrow road, north of the Nolmine mountains. (road). (Western Nolmine Heights.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. You have heard that 
much of this highway is laid down through grasslands and you realize why they 
say that. Waving and lush, with only occasional breaks for higher hummocks or 
other disruptions in the symmetry, these God-created fields yield their 
territory grudgingly. One area of trampled grasses lies to the north, and you 
think you hear the snort of a horse, and the jingle of harness, and recall that
there are gypsies that sometimes wander these plains with their animals and 
their wagons. Northeast and west the roadway pushes through the plains.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and west.

Dirt road near a swampy lake. (road). (lost) (Western Nolmine Heights.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The grass is thin 
enough here to see the small body of water which serves as a swampy lake. Rich 
in organic matter, the still water sports a rich covering of algae which gives 
it its name. The lake is an interesting sight from the road but the drone of 
insects and the somewhat rank scent coming from it persuades you not to linger 
or attempt to drink from it.
You see exits leading east and southwest.

An ancient, broken road. (road). (lost) (Western Nolmine Heights.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A luxuriant example of
the richness of Imperian and the continent of Aetherius, the grasslands through
which you are passing radiate vitality and strength. Even the inroads made by 
grazing animals carrying riders or being herded along the road have not made 
any significant impact upon the fringes. The grasses grow thickly and one would
be foolish to try to press through them when the highway runs smooth and clear 
instead.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast (hidden), and west.

Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. Tramping along the road, you begin to feel a bit whimsical and decide
to try your hand at walking it with your eyes closed. You can feel the
smoothness of the highway beneath your feet and the slow movement of air
ruffles your hair. When you open your eyes to take a quick peek, you find that
you don't know if you are going the same way as before or not, everything looks
uniform on both sides of you and the road itself gives no clue as to which way
you were going. Shrugging your shoulders you pick a direction, resolving to
stay focused on the journey from now on. Delver of the Depths, Meruchakri

Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. Northwest and east the highway rolls, a thin link to connect a
continent. While you usually take for granted the luxury of being able to have
this track to ease your journey, for some reason the thought of the years of
labor and the dedication of the workers that were needed to erect it settles
into your mind. You pause in your journey, here amid the grasses, to give a
silent thanks for those who passed before you and eased your way. That silent
moment leaves you uplifted for many miles. A fairly large group of prickly
pears lies discarded here. There are 4 pieces of kelp in 4 groups here. There
are 6 maidenhair leaves in 6 groups here. Some hyssop stem is discarded here. A

North of Nolmine Heights. (road). (lost) (Western Nolmine Heights.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Northwest and east the
highway rolls, a thin link to connect a continent. While you usually take for
granted the luxury of being able to have this track to ease your journey, for
some reason the thought of the years of labor and the dedication of the workers
that were needed to erect it settles into your mind. You pause in your journey,
here amid the grasses, to give a silent thanks for those who passed before you
and eased your way. That silent moment leaves you uplifted for many miles. A
fairly large group of prickly pears lies discarded here. There are 4 pieces of
kelp in 4 groups here. There are 6 maidenhair leaves in 6 groups here. Some
hyssop stem is discarded here. A ripe quince fruit lies here. Hovering in the
air and singing a sweet melody is a brilliantly coloured bluebird. Huge eyes
gleaming luminously an eagle owl perches nearby. Chittering madly, a
ring-tailed raccoon darts furtively about underfoot. Massive and immovable as
an iceberg, a tundra bear stands proudly here. Eyes glinting with bloodlust, an
arctic wolf prowls here. Sniffing at the wind curiously, a small white fox
pauses here. A bald eagle soars about on the thermal currents. Preening her
wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. Silent and observant, a red
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Poised
nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. Wings outstretched
to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Hackles raised,
an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Nervously pacing, a small brown
lemming scampers under your feet. Arvanian Kwindan is here, hidden. Sentinel
Gurn Tellaris, Woodland's Vindication is here, hidden. Delver of the Depths,

it with your eyes closed. You can feel the smoothness of the highway beneath

eyes to take a quick peek, you find that you don't know if you are going the
same way as before or not, everything looks uniform on both sides of you and
the road itself gives no clue as to which way you were going. Shrugging your

A narrow road, north of the Nolmine mountains. (road). (Western Nolmine Heights.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. You have heard that
much of this highway is laid down through grasslands and you realize why they
say that. Waving and lush, with only occasional breaks for higher hummocks or
other disruptions in the symmetry, these God-created fields yield their
territory grudgingly. One area of trampled grasses lies to the north, and you
think you hear the snort of a horse, and the jingle of harness, and recall that
there are gypsies that sometimes wander these plains with their animals and
their wagons. Northeast and west the roadway pushes through the plains.
You see exits leading north, northeast, and west.
