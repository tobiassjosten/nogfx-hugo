Depite all of you who do not like it. I am having fun. It&rsquo;s what its for. To have fun. The only reason I am even speaking here is because this old post has half my guild worried, til I pointed out the date. People who do not like you do not worry. I&rsquo;m odd, I step outside the box, but it would be boring not to do otherwise. Heck you might even find her fun if you take the moment to look past your own predjudice and hang out. Broll and I have a thick skin. So have fun saying what you will. I&rsquo;m not changing a damn thing. I&rsquo;m having fun and will continue to do so, even if only to spite all of you.

I won&rsquo;t say everyone&rsquo;s, but a good portion of them? Yes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Blind RP is done, deaf RP, not speaking common, other accents other handicaps and more.
Just because it is done by several others does not automatically make it a good idea or the person doing it intelligent.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It makes the mud interesting.
It makes it tedious and annoying to deal with a person with a shitty RP gimmick.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The rest of you are just uhhappy, bland, unimaginative clones with no balls to do something new and different.
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m a rebellious nonconformist,&rdquo; you might say. Of course, once you decide to be a nonconformist the next step is to find out what the other nonconformists are doing and make sure you&rsquo;re nonconforming correctly.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve adjusted it to make her more comprehensive friendly.
You know how you could make it more &ldquo;comprehensive friendly&rdquo;? Get rid of the shitty RP gimmick.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Less neanderthal but still in keeping with her original RP.
So&mldr; your original RP is having a speech defect? Yeah, that&rsquo;s original. Along with Vierra and Dregaur and Rayalan and everyone else with a shitty RP gimmick.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She was created as a joke and took to life. I was going to go back to my home mud after the joke and never look back.
You&rsquo;re correct, for once. She is a joke. However, I strongly suggest you adhere to the second sentence.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Depite all of you who do not like it. I am having fun. It&rsquo;s what its for. To have fun.
Pretending to have a speech defect is fun? You must have a very sick sense of what &lsquo;fun&rsquo; is, then.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m odd, I step outside the box, but it would be boring not to do otherwise.
The least you could have done while stepping out of the box is avoid the huge pile of shit you set your foot down on.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Heck you might even find her fun if you take the moment to look past your own predjudice and hang out.
It&rsquo;s less &ldquo;predjudice&rdquo; (is that even a word? I think you meant &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo;) and more &ldquo;people with shitty RP gimmicks are not worth roleplaying with&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Broll and I have a thick skin. So have fun saying what you will.
I&rsquo;m afraid that thickness is not skin, it&rsquo;s actually your morbidly jelly-like rolls of fat. You might want to do something about that. Lipo, maybe?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m not changing a damn thing. I&rsquo;m having fun and will continue to do so, even if only to spite all of you. Now I&rsquo;ll let you all back to your fun.
Yes, and we&rsquo;re having fun watching you act like a dipshit and call it &ldquo;roleplay&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s okay, you can keep pretending that you&rsquo;re not an attention whore if you want.</p></blockquote></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10837ba7dca9ea0fca6d0d390ab598ac?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by kuroi_ka_neko@xxx on 23 Jan 2011</p>Speech quirks aren&rsquo;t always bad things.
