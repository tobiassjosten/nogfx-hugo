A steep mountain road. (road). (Western Nolmine Heights.)
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. All rocky 
surfaces along this road are a dull black, marking the beginning or end of the 
ancient hills. The road itself leads one deeper into the mountains, or back out
to wind one's way back to the highway. The upthrust range rising on both sides 
is covered with scrubby grasses and small trees, while further south the green 
grows lusher as the ascending peaks trap the water-laden clouds that are blown 
against them. The passage is narrow, but carved with perfection allowing for 
ease of travelling. A slight breeze ruffles your hair and clothes, but the 
rocks shimmer with heat nonetheless. A sleek black hound stands stone still, 
ears perked and alert.
You see exits leading southeast, west, down, and a tall archway leads north.

A road cut deep into a windy peak. (road). (Western Nolmine Heights.)
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. The road 
comes to a blustery end here, having reached the highest point of this part of 
the Nolmines. Far below is the rapid torrent of water, cutting through the 
folds of rock that separate this portion of the range from the mountains 
further westward. Sprays of water shoot up against the rocks that impede its 
south and eastward flow and in many places the stream is obscured by the rugged
trees clinging along its banks and up both slopes. The gurgle and rushing 
sounds of the stream are strong and clear to your ears and birds dip in and out
of the spray, snagging the flying insects that also seek the water. Signs of 
civilization lie just ahead, a dwarven-forged pass cut into the high peak. A 
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert.
You see exits leading northeast, east, southeast, southwest, and west.

grows lusher as the ascending peaks trap the water-laden clouds that are blown

folds of rock that separate this portion of the range from the mountains
further westward. Sprays of water shoot up against the rocks that impede its
south and eastward flow and in many places the stream is obscured by the rugged
trees clinging along its banks and up both slopes. The gurgle and rushing
sounds of the stream are strong and clear to your ears and birds dip in and out
of the spray, snagging the flying insects that also seek the water. Signs of
