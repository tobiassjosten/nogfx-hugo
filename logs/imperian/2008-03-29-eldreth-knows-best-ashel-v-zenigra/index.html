mortals that constructed this colossal arena. All that is left of the stones

here, filling the surroundings with a miasma of fear. Mutable Shadow, Lord

raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady
black eyes. A tiny cactus wren flutters about the room. Pacing around the room
a brown striped hyena casts a wary eye. Hunched over himself a brooding vulture
snaps at anything in reach. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the room.
Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here
with confidence and aloofness. Zenigra, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the
surroundings with a miasma of fear.
You see a single exit leading down.
You cease the whirling of your weapon over your head.
