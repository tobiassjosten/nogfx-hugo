(Stavenn): You say, "Hail Stavenn."

Sethren wraps his tail gently around you, affectionately pulling you close.

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

You glare angrily at Sethren.

Leilani steps just out of your reach, her tiny fists bunching up as she
grumbles under her breath.

You mutter, "Can I ha.. . mom... of p..ce, without your presen..."

Sethren smirks.

Sethren Argyle says, "No."

Sethren snaps his fingers in front of you.

You begin to follow Sethren.

Sethren swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

You grumble angrily.

You decide to stop following Sethren Argyle.

Leilani stares unhappily at you, before turning away and
walking off with a haughty glare.

-Walking-

The extensive Stavenn Library. (lost) (City of Stavenn.)
Niccolo stands here with his hands clasped behind his back, lost in
philosophical reverie. A dark velvet sofa sits here invitingly. A black leather
footstool sits here enticing the weary traveller to prop their feet upon it.
The slightly worn velvet cushions of a chair suggest long hours of comfortable
relaxation upon them. There are 2 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. There are
3 Diavlous Knights here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith
is on the ground. A thin red book is here on the ground. This is a library.
You see exits leading north, southwest, west, and northwest.


You take a seat on a plush chocolate velvet chair.

Leilani pulls her tome from its pouch at her waist and lies it
gently on her lap, flipping slowly through the pages.

Leilani taps her fingers against the arm of her chair in
agitation, as she scans impatiently through the pages.

You are pulled out of the room by Sethren and his whip! (yank)

A dim study in the Academy. (City of Stavenn.)
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A carved stone bowl rests here,
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. An elegantly crafted
desk of charred redwood rests in a corner. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A partially-burnt letter has been left
here carelessly.

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.

Sethren smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Leilani growls, brushing the dust from her clothing as she
stands.

The extensive Stavenn Library. (City of Stavenn.)

You are pulled out of the room by Sethren and his whip! (yank)
A dim study in the Academy. (City of Stavenn.)

Sethren moves over to block the southeast exit.

You narrow your eyes at Sethren in an unnerving manner.

-takes off running-

A tiny niche at the back of the cave. (Eglondes Gecnawing.)
You see a single exit leading southwest.

Leilani kneels down, wrapping her cloak tightly around her as
she slows her breathing, trying to remain as quiet as possible.

You shiver violently.

A tiny niche at the back of the cave. (Eglondes Gecnawing.)
The rough, uneven walls and floor of the dark cave are slick with condensation.
The smell of damp and mildew emanates from the walls, filling the air with its
somewhat sickening scent. Little light is available, except for a faint glow
from around the curve to the southwest. The ceiling is low, disallowing
standing up straight, and the walls are close. The floor slants upward, further
decreasing the size of the niche. You see a single exit leading southwest.

You quickly eat a primrose stalk.
You now possess the gift of the third eye. (third eye)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 122 players on this plane and 10 players on other planes.

Leilani peers suspiciously about herself, trembling nervously. She stands slowly,
hugging the cloak tight around her body as she takes a few
tentative steps out of the niche.

Sethren ripples into existence before you.

You give a horrified gasp.

The mouth of a cave in the mountainside. (Eglondes Gecnawing.)
You see exits leading northeast and out.

You are pulled out of the room by Sethren and his whip! (yank)

A tiny niche at the back of the cave. (Eglondes Gecnawing.)
You see a single exit leading southwest.

Sethren moves over to block the southwest exit.

Sethren stops you from moving that way.

Sethren smirks.

Sethren Argyle simply looks at you, not making any movements for now. His tail
swishes back and forth, the only thing signifying his irritation.

Leilani backs up against the wall of the cavern, growling at you, "Go away," she
says quietly.

Sethren Argyle grins very slightly. He quickly moves over to you, taking your
wrist and throwing you down to the ground, hard. "Now..what did you think you
were going to do?" he asks, staring down at you.

Leilani winces as she is slammed to the hard cavern floor, the rocks grinding
into her sore back. She growls angrily, pushing back away from you and hissing
out, "I was merely trying to be anywhere you were not. I think that should have
been fairly apparent." As she speaks, her hand falls on a jagged length of rock.
The anger flares in her eyes as she wraps her fingers around it. She lunges
forward, slashing at your legs and trying to rush past you in the same instant.

Sethren Argyle doesn&#39;t seem at all surprised, simply side-stepping the rock in
your hands, then using his body to shove you very hard into the ground, his
weight pinning you down. He slaps you across the face, his hand only a blur as
the blow lands. His eyes cold with fury, he draws his hand back and strikes you
again, all with a force he hasn&#39;t used before.

Leilani screams in frustration as you move away from her attack. Her body
shudders as she&#39;s tossed back to the ground, tears springing to her eyes
instantly as the first hard blow lands. She cries out, rage and pain coloring
her voice as she struggles to push you away, tiny fists pummeling uselessly
against your chest.

Sethren Argyle strikes you quite hard with the back of his hand, his nails
leaving shallow scratches across your face. He uses his other hand to take both
of yours, pinning them to the ground. "So..evidently you haven&#39;t learned well
enough..that you need to be afraid of me." His tail sways slowly behind him as
he stares coldly at you.

Leilani pants heavily as her struggles slowly lessen, your words filtering
through her rage. Her gaze meets your own, and a burning hatred is reflected
there. She lies stiffly beneath you, saying nothing.

Sethren Argyle hisses, obviously frustrated at your stubbornness. He leaps to
his feet, taking hold of your wrist with bruising force and yanking you up with
him. He flings you against the wall of the cave, his hand moving quickly around
your throat and pressing very hard. With no way for you to breathe whatsoever,
he stares at you with rage burning in his eyes. "Do you REALLY want to push me
any further?"

Leilani is strangely quiet as she is flung about the room, her body going limp.
Dark eyes stare up at you, the heat gone from them as they glass over with unshed
tears. She trembles silently beneath you, the fight gone and leaving in its place
nothing more than a frightened child.

Sethren Argyle continues to stare at you, his eyes showing no change whatsoever
in emotion. His hand stays clamped around your throat, small bruises forming
under his fingers. "Mrrh. I should just let you die. Maybe it&#39;s not worth it to
break you." Tail swishing behind him, he simply watches you tremble beneath
him.

Leilani simply stares up at you, the tears now falling swiftly down her face.

Sethren Argyle pulls you down by your throat, then throws you down to the
ground. He crouches down on top of you, his knee pressing into your stomach and
holding you down. "Are you going to try to attack me again, little one? Or
perhaps I should just torture you until you fear attacking me too much to even
think about it?"

Sethren smirks.

Leilani shudders violently, drawing in one raspy breath after
another as you release her throat. She grunts as you shove your knee into her
stomach. Through all this, her gaze never leaves your own, as her tears
continue to stream down her face. At your words, she only shakes her head a
slight bit.

Sethren Argyle narrows his eyes at you, but relents at last, moving to sit next
to you. He picks up the rock you tried to attack him with, toying with it as he
watches you.

Leilani watches you quietly, her eyes darting down to the rock
for a split second before returning to your eyes. They stare at your face,
darting from one feature to another, returning to your eyes frequently. She
continues to silently sob, her tiny body trembling as she lies on the cavern
floor, drawing in deep raspy breaths.

Sethren Argyle smiles wryly, setting the rock aside. He murmurs under his
breath, pondering you for a moment. "Well, I would say you learned your lesson
for now. Wouldn&#39;t you?"

Leilani draws in an especially deep, shuddering breath, wincing as the cool
cavern air stings her sore throat. She shifts gingerly, moving her shoulder
away from a sharp rock. Your words seem to take a moment to filter through to
her mind. After a few quiet moments, she nods once, her eyes still studying
your face.

Sethren Argyle says, "What are you looking for? You aren&#39;t going to find
anything new."

Sethren sits down.

Leilani allows her eyes to fall away from your face, and instead she focuses
on the rock. "I ... am ... trying to understand," she says slowly, in the
barest of whispers, her voice harsh and cracking.

Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, moving a little closer to you. He runs a hand
tenderly through your hair, whispering to you, "That&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to do..is
make you understand. You are mine and it will not change. Struggle is useless.
Should realize I truly do not care if it is willing or not."

Leilani grows confused by your sudden tenderness, she blinks rapidly, her gaze
turning back to your face. She stares hard at you, a morbid fascination echoed
in her eyes now, instead of raging spite. She licks her cracked lips slowly,
"You... " she begins but stops short. Her eyes fall softly closed and she loses
herself in thought.

Sethren Argyle takes your hand, pulling you to a sitting position, and then up
against him. He whispers into your ear, "The sooner you accept it..the less
pain you&#39;ll have to go through. I already know you really won&#39;t, though. So it
will just have to continue like it has.."

Leilani slowly wipes the tears from her face, wincing as she brushes against
the bruised and torn flesh. Drawing herself up, she tucks the cloak tighter
around her body. She stares at your hands, an odd look on her
face. "So.. strange.." she rasps.

Sethren Argyle nods slowly, whispering back, "And only likely to get stranger
for you. I want you to sit in front of me, like I had you do in Ssyra..before
you fell asleep.".

Leilani tilts her head slightly, looking curiously at you, "That.. is when you
turned my mind against me, is it not?" she rasps quietly, no bitterness in her
tone.

Sethren whispers to you, "I told you before, I added nothing that wasn&#39;t
already there."

Leilani frowns slightly, trying to process your words. She absentmindedly
draws a random pattern in the dust before her, "What exactly do you need me
to do?" she rasps.

Sethren Argyle strokes your back lightly, watching you playing with the dust.
"Just sit and relax, you don&#39;t have to worry about anything else for a while.".

Leilani glances up, "Will it hurt?" she asks, before returning to the ever more
intricate pattern in the dirt.

Sethren Argyle eyes the pattern, taking a deep breath for some reason. "No.".

You sit yourself down.

Leilani wipes away her pattern, slowly shifting to sit cross-legged in front
of you. She looks up to meet your gaze, a curiously distant expression on her
face as she waits quietly. She folds her hands neatly in her lap.

Sethren Argyle takes a tarot deck from the pouch at his waist, and a small
string as well. He removes a card with a spiral design on the face, punching a
hole in it with his fingernail. Threading the string through it, he holds it
up, moving it slowly back and forth in front of you. He speak slowly, calmly,
"Focus on the spiral. Let it be the only thing you see."

Leilani stares dispassionately at the card, gently twisting on its string.
Growing very still, she focuses her attention completely on the simple pattern,
and she takes on a dreamy expression.

Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, though not visible to you as your attention is
fully on the tarot card. He continues to move it back and forth, watching it
take effect. "Watch it..do not be distracted. Nothing else but the spiral and
my voice exists to you." He nods very slightly to himself, still speaking in
that same very calm voice. "Anything I say for you to do from this point on is
law..you will feel compelled to do it by no other force than yourself.
Understand?".

Leilani leans forward very slightly as she continues to stare at the card. At
your words she whispers hoarsely, "I understand," nodding absently.

Sethren Argyle stops moving at all, except for the card he swings slowly back
and forth. "When you think of attacking me, something will go off in your mind.
Pain..not physical pain..but mental. A terrible screeching, but instead of
being from some outside source, it will be from -inside- your mind. An
unbearable sound, something..much worse than anything you&#39;ve ever heard.".

Leilani nods slowly at you.

Sethren Argyle keeps swinging the card for a bit longer, speaking his final
instructions to you. "As well..when I speak the word "trance", you will
instantly fall under this state of mind I put you into, without anything else
being necessary. Anything I say after that word and before I snap my fingers,
will be done." He smiles slightly. "Now, after I snap my fingers, you will
remember nothing consciously. You simply fell asleep again."

Sethren snaps his fingers in front of you.

You blink.

Sethren Argyle says, "Stand up, you slept too long."

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren stands up from the ground.

You stand up from the ground.

Sethren beckons you to him.

You begin to follow Sethren.

-walking to Stavenn-

You follow Sethren to the southwest.
Fine Foods of Olde Stavenn.
Cachi Calitri wields his knife with efficiency, another culinary masterpiece in
the making on the cutting board before him. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A runic totem is planted solidly in the
ground. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see
what is for sale.
You see exits leading northeast (open door) and up (open door).

-eating so she dun starve-

You follow Sethren to the up.
Filand&#39;s Upstairs Bar.
A small wooden sign hangs beside the door. A runic totem is planted solidly in
the ground. A vibrant crimson embroidered hammock hangs here, its ruby beads
glimmering slightly with each gentle movement of the wind. A Tanari foreman
stands here, mumbling about something. An old drunk sits behind a table here,
drinking his fill. A display case is here. A tall, high-backed stool sits here.
Filand, the Bartender, is looking around attentively. A sigil in the shape of a
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Pillar candles of varying sizes
cast a sombre glow upon the tavern table here, their flickering light bringing
out the rich indigo and gold of the table runners. Its rich colours catching
the eye of those who enter, a tall stool made from ironwood and cushioned in
indigo and gold is positioned close to the bar here. You see a sign here
instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
A dark stairwell leads down (open door).

Sethren ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."

Comprehension flashes across Sethren&#39;s face.

You follow Sethren to the down.
Fine Foods of Olde Stavenn.

Sethren pours out the contents of an Icy Justice on the ground.

-walking some more, confused as all hell-

Amid the reeds. (lost) (Modin Valley.?)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. You
stand upon the very fringes of the river Ederith where it flows through the
Modin valley. Here tall reeds soften the verdant fringes of the river, growing
almost to head height. The waters flow gently by, almost bursting their banks
at points, while amid the reeds small water-dwelling birds make their way,
leaving a trail of swaying heads behind. You see exits leading east, south,
west, and northwest.

You crease your brow in a frown.

Sethren Argyle crouches down next to the water, dipping the empty glass in and
rinsing out what&#39;s left of the alcohol. Finished, he fills it with water,
handing it over to you. "You need this, I think.".

Sethren gives an Icy Justice to you.

The evening sun begins to cast long shadows across the darkening land.

The deep red moon pulsates as it fades slowly into the clouds.

Leilani takes a very small sip of water, shuddering as she swallows the
liquid. Tears immediately spring to her eyes and she nearly falls to the
ground, her knees suddenly growing weak. She makes a small mewling
noise, as her fingertips travel across her badly bruised neck.

Sethren Argyle wraps his tail around you, holding you closer to him and keeping
you upright.

Sethren whispers to you, "Answers my question as to how you were feeling.."

Leilani shudders, but makes no move to pull away from you, her thoughts
obviously drawn inward as she raises her fingertips to the side of her face,
drawing in a hissing breath as she feels the scratches on her cheek. After a
moment, she realizes her position and takes an unsteady step away from you,
"I am fine," she says in her low, raspy voice.

Sethren Argyle shrugs his shoulders, unwrapping his tail. "Very well," he says,
taking your hand in a very untender way, pulling you with him as he walks off
towards the city.

-walking-

You follow Sethren to the up.

A dark stairwell leads down (open door).

Sethren takes a seat at an elegantly appointed tavern table.

You take a seat on a tall, high-backed stool.

Leilani leans back in her stool, her eyes falling softly closed as she
draws in a shaky breath, rubbing her temples gently.

Leilani takes another small sip of water, a ripple of pain moving visibly
through her as she swallows.

Sethren Argyle says, "You may rest, if you wish. I don&#39;t require anything
further of you at the moment."

Leilani nods absentmindedly, barely registering your words.

Sethren Argyle sets his drink down on the table, making no motion to drink from
it.

Leilani leans heavily against the bar, folding her arms over it and resting her
head over them. She seems to relax, her breathing becoming steadier as she falls
slowly into her dreams.

You close your eyes, curl up in a ball, and fall asleep.

You open your eyes and stretch languidly, feeling deliciously well-rested.

Sethren stands up from an elegantly appointed tavern table.

Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.

Sethren leaves to the down.


You stand up from a tall, high-backed stool.

-walks home-

An enchanting starlit garden. (lost) (Celidon Council.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Lying
flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. A fierce bobcat prowls in the
grasses. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here.
You see exits leading north, east, and west (open door).

You close the door to the west.
You lock the west door.

Twinkling as much as the stars behind it, the moon of change travels close to
Aetherius.

The chirping of crickets surrounds you in a medley of night-time music.

Sethren tells you, "Hm..where are you?"

You tell Sethren Argyle, "In my home..."

Sethren tells you, "You have a home? That I didn&#39;t realize."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "...it belong to my father&#39;s wife. I have a key, and
am welcome to come and go as I please."

Sethren tells you, "How are you feeling? Besides your throat, anyway, I&#39;m sure
that will take quite a while to heal -smirk-."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "I have ... had better days."

Sethren tells you, "Of course you have."

Sethren tells you, "Suppose there&#39;s bruises and such on your back?"

You tell Sethren Argyle, "..A bit. My wrists... hurt."

Sethren tells you, "They&#39;ve received quite the treatment."


She is a tanari human and is small in stature. Her dark almond eyes are set
into a delicately structured face. Long raven hair is braided severely down her
back and held in place with a silver clasp. A large fire opal decorates the
center of the clasp, bright rainbow hues contrasting strikingly against the
backdrop of ebon tresses. Her pale flesh bears many signs of a recent attack.
Around her neck and wrists are dark bruises. Her face is scratched and bruised.
Her voice has a slightly raspy quality to it, and she moves gingerly. She is
wearing a grim bonecaster&#39;s kitbag, a suit of scale mail, a pair of moonlit
thigh-high boots, an elegant white pleated shortskirt, a fleshy grey flower, a
somber cloak lined in cerulean, and a glass bubble. She is holding a living
vodun doll of Dak in her left hand.

Sethren tells you, "These bruises..these marks..they are necessary. They remind
you that you are owned, that you are a possession. I can treat my property as I
wish, those marks signify such."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "I am not your property."

Sethren tells you, "You are mine entirely, it is inescapable. All that&#39;s left
is to make you realize it."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "There is no use arguing this point. We are both quite
certain that the other is wrong in assumption. Do you need something from me or
may I have the sanctity of my mind returned to me?"

Sethren tells you, "Leilani, do something for me."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "What?"

Sethren tells you, "Think of when you went to attack me with the rock. How
angry you were, how much you needed to simply lash out...and you were so
frustrated when you didn&#39;t succeed! But think about what it would be like, if
you attacked me, and it worked. How good it would feel."

Leilani drops suddenly to her knees, her hands flying to her head as she
screeches in pain. She collapses to the floor, writhing in agony and cradling
her head in her hands, tears streaming down her face.

You tell Sethren Argyle, "....make... it stop...please..."

Sethren tells you, "Mrrh. How cute, it hurts her."

Sethren tells you, "Only you can make it stop. Think of something else, start
to train your brain not to think of it."

Leilani slams her fist to the floor in frustration, pure agony written on her
face as she struggles to overcome her torment. She stares hard at the
iron-worked stairs leading to the rooms above, drinking in every detail.
Slowly, the lines on her face smooth and her body relaxes. She lies, panting,
on the floor, her eyes closed as she tries to recover.

Sethren tells you, "Better?"

You tell Sethren Argyle, "....that is one word for it."

-later on, she wanders back to her city to get a drink-

Filand&#39;s Upstairs Bar. (City of Stavenn.)
A small wooden sign hangs beside the door. A runic totem is planted solidly in
the ground. A vibrant crimson embroidered hammock hangs here, its ruby beads
glimmering slightly with each gentle movement of the wind. A Tanari foreman
stands here, mumbling about something. An old drunk sits behind a table here,
drinking his fill. A display case is here. A tall, high-backed stool sits here.
Filand, the Bartender, is looking around attentively. A sigil in the shape of a
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Pillar candles of varying sizes
cast a sombre glow upon the tavern table here, their flickering light bringing
out the rich indigo and gold of the table runners. Its rich colours catching
the eye of those who enter, a tall stool made from ironwood and cushioned in
indigo and gold is positioned close to the bar here. Lady Dagny Tiamat,
Commander of the Black Rose is here. She wields a dwarven battleaxe in each
hand. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what
is for sale.
A dark stairwell leads down (open door).
Filand turns his attention toward you for a moment as you enter.

Leilani takes a seat carefully on the high bar stool, gingerly adjusting the
cloak around her shoulders, wincing a bit as the fabric shifts.

You take a seat on a tall, high-backed stool.

Dagny gives you the once over.

Dagny bows respectfully to you.

She is an armored akrabi and is moving with unnatural fluidity for her
segmented body.  Pale carapace covers her head, its smooth surface disturbed by
the appearance of two exotically tilted eyes and a motionless pair of
mandibles.  Contrasted with the white of her shell, the pink in her aloof gaze
seems almost a blemish.  On closer inspection, the eyes are disproportional,
each one holding three separate orbs that gleam coldly at her surroundings. 
Snowy chitinous plates of armor define her slim figure.  Down her back two
ashen lines give the illusion of a spine while the plates there are so tight
that the only membrane to be seen between segments is that leading to her
menacing tail.  Its five segments curve dangerously up behind her, tipped
finally by a malignant barb that glistens with indiscernible poison.  Even a
novice can see the warning hidden behind her unconcerned demeanor. She is
wearing a shimmering suit of full plate armour, 5 pocketbelts, a canvas
backpack, an iron collar bearing the crest of the Diavlous Knights, a
militaristic black shirt, a pair of black leather breeches, and a pair of
high-polished black boots. She wields a dwarven battleaxe in each hand.

Leilani glances up, smiling softly as she nods her head in greeting.

Dagny gets some gold sovereigns from a canvas backpack.
Dagny buys a steaming mug of spiced wine.
Dagny buys a steaming mug of spiced wine.
Dagny gives a steaming mug of spiced wine to you.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "Wanderer?"

Leilani nods her head slightly, "Aye," she whispers in a raspy voice,
taking a small sip of the spiced wine, a small shudder running through
her as she swallows.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose narrows her eyes slightly, her
barbed tail twitching briefly behind her.

      Sethren - Entering the gates of St    (271) - City of Stavenn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose rests her hands on the tops of
her axes and leans against the bar, frowning slightly, "Everything well with
you Lady Leilani?"

Leilani ponders for a long moment, silent. She glances nervously around, peering
into the shadows at the edge of the bar. "I have not had the greatest luck as of
late," she rasps quietly, "..but I am sure it will improve soon enough." She
quickly takes another sip of her wine, wincing only a slight bit as she swallows.

Dagny takes a seat on a tall bar stool of indigo and gold.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose swirls the wine in her glass
slowly, peering into it with no apparent interest.  Her lips twist slightly in
a forced smile before she murmurs, "It will improve, or we snap.."

Dagny blinks.

You ponder the situation.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose coughs politely and stands up
from her stool, assuming a relaxed stance by the doorway.

Dagny stands up from a tall bar stool of indigo and gold.

Leilani tugs the cloak a bit tighter around her, "Truth.." she rasps quietly.

Sethren tells you, "Find someone to listen to your problems, did you?"

You tell Sethren Argyle, "I do not know what you are talking about."

Sethren tells you, "You mean you aren&#39;t telling, then?"

Sethren tells you, "Not that it would matter.."

You tell Sethren Argyle, "Your name has not passed my lips, nor has my current
unfortunate situation. It would do me no service to tell anyone, especially a
Stavennite."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Sethren - Entering the gates of St    (271) - City of Stavenn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose glances down the stairs with a
measure of readiness in her eyes and then back towards you, "Things will get
better."

Sethren tells you, "Good girl."

Leilani smiles softly, the expression not reaching her eyes as she rasps, "One
can only hope."

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose reaches out and tousles your
hair with a clawed hand.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "Insanity..."

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "Might be just what you
need."

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "Oddly enough."

You smirk.

Leilani nods slowly, "Perhaps I shall look deeper into my Lord&#39;s teachings,
then. You might be correct," she rasps quietly.

Dagny smirks.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "That was not what I
meant."

You tilt your head curiously at Dagny.

Dagny shakes her head.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "It matters not Lady
Leilani."

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose looks thoughtful and says, "It
is a shock to find one so visibly distraught."

Leilani frowns slightly, "I do not feel very distraught. Sore, perhaps. It will
pass." she rasps softly.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose frowns and says, "Very well,
then I shall cease allowing my mouth to run and rest in silence."

You grow still and begin to silently pray for preservation of your soul while
you are out of the land.

Dagny bows respectfully to you.

Farewell for now!'>-Leilani logs in-
(Stavenn): You say, "Hail Stavenn."
Sethren wraps his tail gently around you, affectionately pulling you close.
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
You glare angrily at Sethren.
Leilani steps just out of your reach, her tiny fists bunching up as she
grumbles under her breath.
You mutter, "Can I ha.. . mom... of p..ce, without your presen..."
Sethren smirks.
Sethren Argyle says, "No."
Sethren snaps his fingers in front of you.
You begin to follow Sethren.
Sethren swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
You grumble angrily.
You decide to stop following Sethren Argyle.
Leilani stares unhappily at you, before turning away and
walking off with a haughty glare.
-Walking-
The extensive Stavenn Library. (lost) (City of Stavenn.)
Niccolo stands here with his hands clasped behind his back, lost in
philosophical reverie. A dark velvet sofa sits here invitingly. A black leather
footstool sits here enticing the weary traveller to prop their feet upon it.
The slightly worn velvet cushions of a chair suggest long hours of comfortable
relaxation upon them. There are 2 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. There are
3 Diavlous Knights here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith
is on the ground. A thin red book is here on the ground. This is a library.
You see exits leading north, southwest, west, and northwest.
You take a seat on a plush chocolate velvet chair.
Leilani pulls her tome from its pouch at her waist and lies it
gently on her lap, flipping slowly through the pages.
Leilani taps her fingers against the arm of her chair in
agitation, as she scans impatiently through the pages.
You are pulled out of the room by Sethren and his whip! (yank)
A dim study in the Academy. (City of Stavenn.)
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A carved stone bowl rests here,
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. An elegantly crafted
desk of charred redwood rests in a corner. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A partially-burnt letter has been left
here carelessly.
You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.
Sethren smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Leilani growls, brushing the dust from her clothing as she
stands.
The extensive Stavenn Library. (City of Stavenn.)
You are pulled out of the room by Sethren and his whip! (yank)
A dim study in the Academy. (City of Stavenn.)
Sethren moves over to block the southeast exit.
You narrow your eyes at Sethren in an unnerving manner.
-takes off running-
A tiny niche at the back of the cave. (Eglondes Gecnawing.)
You see a single exit leading southwest.
Leilani kneels down, wrapping her cloak tightly around her as
she slows her breathing, trying to remain as quiet as possible.
You shiver violently.
A tiny niche at the back of the cave. (Eglondes Gecnawing.)
The rough, uneven walls and floor of the dark cave are slick with condensation.
The smell of damp and mildew emanates from the walls, filling the air with its
somewhat sickening scent. Little light is available, except for a faint glow
from around the curve to the southwest. The ceiling is low, disallowing
standing up straight, and the walls are close. The floor slants upward, further
decreasing the size of the niche. You see a single exit leading southwest.
You quickly eat a primrose stalk.
You now possess the gift of the third eye. (third eye)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 122 players on this plane and 10 players on other planes.
Leilani peers suspiciously about herself, trembling nervously. She stands slowly,
hugging the cloak tight around her body as she takes a few
tentative steps out of the niche.
Sethren ripples into existence before you.
You give a horrified gasp.
The mouth of a cave in the mountainside. (Eglondes Gecnawing.)
You see exits leading northeast and out.
You are pulled out of the room by Sethren and his whip! (yank)
A tiny niche at the back of the cave. (Eglondes Gecnawing.)
You see a single exit leading southwest.
Sethren moves over to block the southwest exit.
Sethren stops you from moving that way.
Sethren smirks.
Sethren Argyle simply looks at you, not making any movements for now. His tail
swishes back and forth, the only thing signifying his irritation.
Leilani backs up against the wall of the cavern, growling at you, "Go away," she
says quietly.
Sethren Argyle grins very slightly. He quickly moves over to you, taking your
wrist and throwing you down to the ground, hard. "Now..what did you think you
were going to do?" he asks, staring down at you.
Leilani winces as she is slammed to the hard cavern floor, the rocks grinding
into her sore back. She growls angrily, pushing back away from you and hissing
out, "I was merely trying to be anywhere you were not. I think that should have
been fairly apparent." As she speaks, her hand falls on a jagged length of rock.
The anger flares in her eyes as she wraps her fingers around it. She lunges
forward, slashing at your legs and trying to rush past you in the same instant.
Sethren Argyle doesn't seem at all surprised, simply side-stepping the rock in
your hands, then using his body to shove you very hard into the ground, his
weight pinning you down. He slaps you across the face, his hand only a blur as
the blow lands. His eyes cold with fury, he draws his hand back and strikes you
again, all with a force he hasn't used before.
Leilani screams in frustration as you move away from her attack. Her body
shudders as she's tossed back to the ground, tears springing to her eyes
instantly as the first hard blow lands. She cries out, rage and pain coloring
her voice as she struggles to push you away, tiny fists pummeling uselessly
against your chest.
Sethren Argyle strikes you quite hard with the back of his hand, his nails
leaving shallow scratches across your face. He uses his other hand to take both
of yours, pinning them to the ground. "So..evidently you haven't learned well
enough..that you need to be afraid of me." His tail sways slowly behind him as
he stares coldly at you.
Leilani pants heavily as her struggles slowly lessen, your words filtering
through her rage. Her gaze meets your own, and a burning hatred is reflected
there. She lies stiffly beneath you, saying nothing.
Sethren Argyle hisses, obviously frustrated at your stubbornness. He leaps to
his feet, taking hold of your wrist with bruising force and yanking you up with
him. He flings you against the wall of the cave, his hand moving quickly around
your throat and pressing very hard. With no way for you to breathe whatsoever,
he stares at you with rage burning in his eyes. "Do you REALLY want to push me
any further?"
Leilani is strangely quiet as she is flung about the room, her body going limp.
Dark eyes stare up at you, the heat gone from them as they glass over with unshed
tears. She trembles silently beneath you, the fight gone and leaving in its place
nothing more than a frightened child.
Sethren Argyle continues to stare at you, his eyes showing no change whatsoever
in emotion. His hand stays clamped around your throat, small bruises forming
under his fingers. "Mrrh. I should just let you die. Maybe it's not worth it to
break you." Tail swishing behind him, he simply watches you tremble beneath
him.
Leilani simply stares up at you, the tears now falling swiftly down her face.
Sethren Argyle pulls you down by your throat, then throws you down to the
ground. He crouches down on top of you, his knee pressing into your stomach and
holding you down. "Are you going to try to attack me again, little one? Or
perhaps I should just torture you until you fear attacking me too much to even
think about it?"
Sethren smirks.
Leilani shudders violently, drawing in one raspy breath after
another as you release her throat. She grunts as you shove your knee into her
stomach. Through all this, her gaze never leaves your own, as her tears
continue to stream down her face. At your words, she only shakes her head a
slight bit.
Sethren Argyle narrows his eyes at you, but relents at last, moving to sit next
to you. He picks up the rock you tried to attack him with, toying with it as he
watches you.
Leilani watches you quietly, her eyes darting down to the rock
for a split second before returning to your eyes. They stare at your face,
darting from one feature to another, returning to your eyes frequently. She
continues to silently sob, her tiny body trembling as she lies on the cavern
floor, drawing in deep raspy breaths.
Sethren Argyle smiles wryly, setting the rock aside. He murmurs under his
breath, pondering you for a moment. "Well, I would say you learned your lesson
for now. Wouldn't you?"
Leilani draws in an especially deep, shuddering breath, wincing as the cool
cavern air stings her sore throat. She shifts gingerly, moving her shoulder
away from a sharp rock. Your words seem to take a moment to filter through to
her mind. After a few quiet moments, she nods once, her eyes still studying
your face.
Sethren Argyle says, "What are you looking for? You aren't going to find
anything new."
Sethren sits down.
Leilani allows her eyes to fall away from your face, and instead she focuses
on the rock. "I ... am ... trying to understand," she says slowly, in the
barest of whispers, her voice harsh and cracking.
Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, moving a little closer to you. He runs a hand
tenderly through your hair, whispering to you, "That's all I'm trying to do..is
make you understand. You are mine and it will not change. Struggle is useless.
Should realize I truly do not care if it is willing or not."
Leilani grows confused by your sudden tenderness, she blinks rapidly, her gaze
turning back to your face. She stares hard at you, a morbid fascination echoed
in her eyes now, instead of raging spite. She licks her cracked lips slowly,
"You... " she begins but stops short. Her eyes fall softly closed and she loses
herself in thought.
Sethren Argyle takes your hand, pulling you to a sitting position, and then up
against him. He whispers into your ear, "The sooner you accept it..the less
pain you'll have to go through. I already know you really won't, though. So it
will just have to continue like it has.."
Leilani slowly wipes the tears from her face, wincing as she brushes against
the bruised and torn flesh. Drawing herself up, she tucks the cloak tighter
around her body. She stares at your hands, an odd look on her
face. "So.. strange.." she rasps.
Sethren Argyle nods slowly, whispering back, "And only likely to get stranger
for you. I want you to sit in front of me, like I had you do in Ssyra..before
you fell asleep.".
Leilani tilts her head slightly, looking curiously at you, "That.. is when you
turned my mind against me, is it not?" she rasps quietly, no bitterness in her
tone.
Sethren whispers to you, "I told you before, I added nothing that wasn't
already there."
Leilani frowns slightly, trying to process your words. She absentmindedly
draws a random pattern in the dust before her, "What exactly do you need me
to do?" she rasps.
Sethren Argyle strokes your back lightly, watching you playing with the dust.
"Just sit and relax, you don't have to worry about anything else for a while.".
Leilani glances up, "Will it hurt?" she asks, before returning to the ever more
intricate pattern in the dirt.
Sethren Argyle eyes the pattern, taking a deep breath for some reason. "No.".
You sit yourself down.
Leilani wipes away her pattern, slowly shifting to sit cross-legged in front
of you. She looks up to meet your gaze, a curiously distant expression on her
face as she waits quietly. She folds her hands neatly in her lap.
Sethren Argyle takes a tarot deck from the pouch at his waist, and a small
string as well. He removes a card with a spiral design on the face, punching a
hole in it with his fingernail. Threading the string through it, he holds it
up, moving it slowly back and forth in front of you. He speak slowly, calmly,
"Focus on the spiral. Let it be the only thing you see."
Leilani stares dispassionately at the card, gently twisting on its string.
Growing very still, she focuses her attention completely on the simple pattern,
and she takes on a dreamy expression.
Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, though not visible to you as your attention is
fully on the tarot card. He continues to move it back and forth, watching it
take effect. "Watch it..do not be distracted. Nothing else but the spiral and
my voice exists to you." He nods very slightly to himself, still speaking in
that same very calm voice. "Anything I say for you to do from this point on is
law..you will feel compelled to do it by no other force than yourself.
Understand?".
Leilani leans forward very slightly as she continues to stare at the card. At
your words she whispers hoarsely, "I understand," nodding absently.
Sethren Argyle stops moving at all, except for the card he swings slowly back
and forth. "When you think of attacking me, something will go off in your mind.
Pain..not physical pain..but mental. A terrible screeching, but instead of
being from some outside source, it will be from -inside- your mind. An
unbearable sound, something..much worse than anything you've ever heard.".
Leilani nods slowly at you.
Sethren Argyle keeps swinging the card for a bit longer, speaking his final
instructions to you. "As well..when I speak the word "trance", you will
instantly fall under this state of mind I put you into, without anything else
being necessary. Anything I say after that word and before I snap my fingers,
will be done." He smiles slightly. "Now, after I snap my fingers, you will
remember nothing consciously. You simply fell asleep again."
Sethren snaps his fingers in front of you.
You blink.
Sethren Argyle says, "Stand up, you slept too long."
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Sethren stands up from the ground.
You stand up from the ground.
Sethren beckons you to him.
You begin to follow Sethren.
-walking to Stavenn-
You follow Sethren to the southwest.
Fine Foods of Olde Stavenn.
Cachi Calitri wields his knife with efficiency, another culinary masterpiece in
the making on the cutting board before him. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A runic totem is planted solidly in the
ground. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see
what is for sale.
You see exits leading northeast (open door) and up (open door).
-eating so she dun starve-
You follow Sethren to the up.
Filand's Upstairs Bar.
A small wooden sign hangs beside the door. A runic totem is planted solidly in
the ground. A vibrant crimson embroidered hammock hangs here, its ruby beads
glimmering slightly with each gentle movement of the wind. A Tanari foreman
stands here, mumbling about something. An old drunk sits behind a table here,
drinking his fill. A display case is here. A tall, high-backed stool sits here.
Filand, the Bartender, is looking around attentively. A sigil in the shape of a
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Pillar candles of varying sizes
cast a sombre glow upon the tavern table here, their flickering light bringing
out the rich indigo and gold of the table runners. Its rich colours catching
the eye of those who enter, a tall stool made from ironwood and cushioned in
indigo and gold is positioned close to the bar here. You see a sign here
instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
A dark stairwell leads down (open door).
Sethren ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."
Comprehension flashes across Sethren's face.
You follow Sethren to the down.
Fine Foods of Olde Stavenn.
Sethren pours out the contents of an Icy Justice on the ground.
-walking some more, confused as all hell-
Amid the reeds. (lost) (Modin Valley.?)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. You
stand upon the very fringes of the river Ederith where it flows through the
Modin valley. Here tall reeds soften the verdant fringes of the river, growing
almost to head height. The waters flow gently by, almost bursting their banks
at points, while amid the reeds small water-dwelling birds make their way,
leaving a trail of swaying heads behind. You see exits leading east, south,
west, and northwest.
You crease your brow in a frown.
Sethren Argyle crouches down next to the water, dipping the empty glass in and
rinsing out what's left of the alcohol. Finished, he fills it with water,
handing it over to you. "You need this, I think.".
Sethren gives an Icy Justice to you.
The evening sun begins to cast long shadows across the darkening land.
The deep red moon pulsates as it fades slowly into the clouds.
Leilani takes a very small sip of water, shuddering as she swallows the
liquid. Tears immediately spring to her eyes and she nearly falls to the
ground, her knees suddenly growing weak. She makes a small mewling
noise, as her fingertips travel across her badly bruised neck.
Sethren Argyle wraps his tail around you, holding you closer to him and keeping
you upright.
Sethren whispers to you, "Answers my question as to how you were feeling.."
Leilani shudders, but makes no move to pull away from you, her thoughts
obviously drawn inward as she raises her fingertips to the side of her face,
drawing in a hissing breath as she feels the scratches on her cheek. After a
moment, she realizes her position and takes an unsteady step away from you,
"I am fine," she says in her low, raspy voice.
Sethren Argyle shrugs his shoulders, unwrapping his tail. "Very well," he says,
taking your hand in a very untender way, pulling you with him as he walks off
towards the city.
-walking-
You follow Sethren to the up.

Sethren takes a seat at an elegantly appointed tavern table.
You take a seat on a tall, high-backed stool.
Leilani leans back in her stool, her eyes falling softly closed as she
draws in a shaky breath, rubbing her temples gently.
Leilani takes another small sip of water, a ripple of pain moving visibly
through her as she swallows.
Sethren Argyle says, "You may rest, if you wish. I don't require anything
further of you at the moment."
Leilani nods absentmindedly, barely registering your words.
Sethren Argyle sets his drink down on the table, making no motion to drink from
it.
Leilani leans heavily against the bar, folding her arms over it and resting her
head over them. She seems to relax, her breathing becoming steadier as she falls
slowly into her dreams.
You close your eyes, curl up in a ball, and fall asleep.
You open your eyes and stretch languidly, feeling deliciously well-rested.
Sethren stands up from an elegantly appointed tavern table.
Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.
Sethren leaves to the down.
You stand up from a tall, high-backed stool.
-walks home-
An enchanting starlit garden. (lost) (Celidon Council.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Lying
flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. A fierce bobcat prowls in the
grasses. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here.
You see exits leading north, east, and west (open door).
You close the door to the west.
You lock the west door.
Twinkling as much as the stars behind it, the moon of change travels close to
Aetherius.
The chirping of crickets surrounds you in a medley of night-time music.
Sethren tells you, "Hm..where are you?"
You tell Sethren Argyle, "In my home..."
Sethren tells you, "You have a home? That I didn't realize."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "...it belong to my father's wife. I have a key, and
am welcome to come and go as I please."
Sethren tells you, "How are you feeling? Besides your throat, anyway, I'm sure
that will take quite a while to heal -smirk-."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "I have ... had better days."
Sethren tells you, "Of course you have."
Sethren tells you, "Suppose there's bruises and such on your back?"
You tell Sethren Argyle, "..A bit. My wrists... hurt."
Sethren tells you, "They've received quite the treatment."
She is a tanari human and is small in stature. Her dark almond eyes are set
into a delicately structured face. Long raven hair is braided severely down her
back and held in place with a silver clasp. A large fire opal decorates the
center of the clasp, bright rainbow hues contrasting strikingly against the
backdrop of ebon tresses. Her pale flesh bears many signs of a recent attack.
Around her neck and wrists are dark bruises. Her face is scratched and bruised.
Her voice has a slightly raspy quality to it, and she moves gingerly. She is
wearing a grim bonecaster's kitbag, a suit of scale mail, a pair of moonlit
thigh-high boots, an elegant white pleated shortskirt, a fleshy grey flower, a
somber cloak lined in cerulean, and a glass bubble. She is holding a living
vodun doll of Dak in her left hand.
Sethren tells you, "These bruises..these marks..they are necessary. They remind
you that you are owned, that you are a possession. I can treat my property as I
wish, those marks signify such."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "I am not your property."
Sethren tells you, "You are mine entirely, it is inescapable. All that's left
is to make you realize it."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "There is no use arguing this point. We are both quite
certain that the other is wrong in assumption. Do you need something from me or
may I have the sanctity of my mind returned to me?"
Sethren tells you, "Leilani, do something for me."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "What?"
Sethren tells you, "Think of when you went to attack me with the rock. How
angry you were, how much you needed to simply lash out...and you were so
frustrated when you didn't succeed! But think about what it would be like, if
you attacked me, and it worked. How good it would feel."
Leilani drops suddenly to her knees, her hands flying to her head as she
screeches in pain. She collapses to the floor, writhing in agony and cradling
her head in her hands, tears streaming down her face.
You tell Sethren Argyle, "....make... it stop...please..."
Sethren tells you, "Mrrh. How cute, it hurts her."
Sethren tells you, "Only you can make it stop. Think of something else, start
to train your brain not to think of it."
Leilani slams her fist to the floor in frustration, pure agony written on her
face as she struggles to overcome her torment. She stares hard at the
iron-worked stairs leading to the rooms above, drinking in every detail.
Slowly, the lines on her face smooth and her body relaxes. She lies, panting,
on the floor, her eyes closed as she tries to recover.
Sethren tells you, "Better?"
You tell Sethren Argyle, "....that is one word for it."
-later on, she wanders back to her city to get a drink-
Filand's Upstairs Bar. (City of Stavenn.)
A small wooden sign hangs beside the door. A runic totem is planted solidly in
the ground. A vibrant crimson embroidered hammock hangs here, its ruby beads
glimmering slightly with each gentle movement of the wind. A Tanari foreman
stands here, mumbling about something. An old drunk sits behind a table here,
drinking his fill. A display case is here. A tall, high-backed stool sits here.
Filand, the Bartender, is looking around attentively. A sigil in the shape of a
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Pillar candles of varying sizes
cast a sombre glow upon the tavern table here, their flickering light bringing
out the rich indigo and gold of the table runners. Its rich colours catching
the eye of those who enter, a tall stool made from ironwood and cushioned in
indigo and gold is positioned close to the bar here. Lady Dagny Tiamat,
Commander of the Black Rose is here. She wields a dwarven battleaxe in each
hand. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what
is for sale.
A dark stairwell leads down (open door).
Filand turns his attention toward you for a moment as you enter.
Leilani takes a seat carefully on the high bar stool, gingerly adjusting the
cloak around her shoulders, wincing a bit as the fabric shifts.
You take a seat on a tall, high-backed stool.
Dagny gives you the once over.
Dagny bows respectfully to you.
She is an armored akrabi and is moving with unnatural fluidity for her
segmented body. Pale carapace covers her head, its smooth surface disturbed by
the appearance of two exotically tilted eyes and a motionless pair of
mandibles. Contrasted with the white of her shell, the pink in her aloof gaze
seems almost a blemish. On closer inspection, the eyes are disproportional,
each one holding three separate orbs that gleam coldly at her surroundings.
Snowy chitinous plates of armor define her slim figure. Down her back two
ashen lines give the illusion of a spine while the plates there are so tight
that the only membrane to be seen between segments is that leading to her
menacing tail. Its five segments curve dangerously up behind her, tipped
finally by a malignant barb that glistens with indiscernible poison. Even a
novice can see the warning hidden behind her unconcerned demeanor. She is
wearing a shimmering suit of full plate armour, 5 pocketbelts, a canvas
backpack, an iron collar bearing the crest of the Diavlous Knights, a
militaristic black shirt, a pair of black leather breeches, and a pair of
high-polished black boots. She wields a dwarven battleaxe in each hand.
Leilani glances up, smiling softly as she nods her head in greeting.
Dagny gets some gold sovereigns from a canvas backpack.
Dagny buys a steaming mug of spiced wine.
Dagny buys a steaming mug of spiced wine.
Dagny gives a steaming mug of spiced wine to you.
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "Wanderer?"
Leilani nods her head slightly, "Aye," she whispers in a raspy voice,
taking a small sip of the spiced wine, a small shudder running through
her as she swallows.
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose narrows her eyes slightly, her
barbed tail twitching briefly behind her.

Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose rests her hands on the tops of
her axes and leans against the bar, frowning slightly, "Everything well with
you Lady Leilani?"
Leilani ponders for a long moment, silent. She glances nervously around, peering
into the shadows at the edge of the bar. "I have not had the greatest luck as of
late," she rasps quietly, "..but I am sure it will improve soon enough." She
quickly takes another sip of her wine, wincing only a slight bit as she swallows.
Dagny takes a seat on a tall bar stool of indigo and gold.
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose swirls the wine in her glass
slowly, peering into it with no apparent interest. Her lips twist slightly in
a forced smile before she murmurs, "It will improve, or we snap.."
Dagny blinks.
You ponder the situation.
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose coughs politely and stands up
from her stool, assuming a relaxed stance by the doorway.
Dagny stands up from a tall bar stool of indigo and gold.
Leilani tugs the cloak a bit tighter around her, "Truth.." she rasps quietly.
Sethren tells you, "Find someone to listen to your problems, did you?"
You tell Sethren Argyle, "I do not know what you are talking about."
Sethren tells you, "You mean you aren't telling, then?"
Sethren tells you, "Not that it would matter.."
You tell Sethren Argyle, "Your name has not passed my lips, nor has my current
unfortunate situation. It would do me no service to tell anyone, especially a
Stavennite."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sethren - Entering the gates of St (271) - City of Stavenn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose glances down the stairs with a
measure of readiness in her eyes and then back towards you, "Things will get
better."
Sethren tells you, "Good girl."
Leilani smiles softly, the expression not reaching her eyes as she rasps, "One
can only hope."
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose reaches out and tousles your
hair with a clawed hand.
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "Insanity..."
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "Might be just what you
need."
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "Oddly enough."
You smirk.
Leilani nods slowly, "Perhaps I shall look deeper into my Lord's teachings,
then. You might be correct," she rasps quietly.
Dagny smirks.
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "That was not what I
meant."
You tilt your head curiously at Dagny.
Dagny shakes her head.
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose says, "It matters not Lady
Leilani."
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose looks thoughtful and says, "It
is a shock to find one so visibly distraught."
Leilani frowns slightly, "I do not feel very distraught. Sore, perhaps. It will
pass." she rasps softly.
Lady Dagny Tiamat, Commander of the Black Rose frowns and says, "Very well,
then I shall cease allowing my mouth to run and rest in silence."
You grow still and begin to silently pray for preservation of your soul while
you are out of the land.
Dagny bows respectfully to you.
