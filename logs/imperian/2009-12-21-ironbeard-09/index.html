The rowdy notes of a drinking song, faint at first, then rising to the 
undisputed intensity of a Dwarf On A Mission, herald the arrival of Ironbeard 
the Magnanimous who casts his beam of a smile about himself as he arrives.
Bowing deeply, and a bit unstably, Ironbeard the Magnanimous pronounces his 
blessing, "A gift for Cardi. Oh yes!"
Ironbeard the Magnanimous just gave you a giftbag!

tightly together with intricate whirls and circles that seem to ripple across
