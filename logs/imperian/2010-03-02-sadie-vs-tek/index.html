You carefully watch your footing and swing down from the treetops.
Rubble-filled woodlands.
The forest is very thick here, trees blocking the view of the encircling walls 
of the ruins. A few large pieces of rock, rubble left over from various pillars
that used to stand here, lie on the ground, most of them covered with various 
forms of plant life as the forest slowly recovers. The area is ablaze! A sigil 
in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A large beehive
hangs down from the trees above. A mighty earth golem stands guard here. A 
swarm of bees hovers menacingly nearby. A Kenuba hippopotamus stands here, 
massive jaws agape. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the northwest. Lord
Tek Reopev is here, wreathed about in roots. He wields a sharpened quarterstaff
in his hands.
You see a single exit leading northwest.
