The path circling the walls is cracked and uneven, roots of plantlife having 
grown under the stone itself. Clumps of grass poke up from within the cracks, 
and small white daisies are dotted here and there, and between the gaps in the 
path, you can spot the hard wood of tree roots wreathing in the earth beneath. 
The wall to the east of the path is crumbling slowly, and looks unsafe to touch
as if it might fall at any moment.

Thick, vibrant ivy has over-grown the whole of the arena wall here, slowly 
adding to the crumbling of the stone as its roots work their way across. Almost
as if a green curtain had been thrown over wall itself, the ivy is a testament 
to the ages that have past since this place was constructed. Tendrils wreath 
the floor with thick vines, threatening to entangle your feet, and there

road continues in its circuitous route around the decaying walls. A thick 
marble pillar lies across the road here, broken into jagged pieces of varying 
size. The pillar came from inside the arena, ruining the wall with its 
tumultuous downfall, and lies across the entire road, here.

A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance 
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking 
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of 
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena 
walls to the southwest.

At a small break in the ruined wall. (road). (North Eastern Arena.)
The ruined arena wall stretches around the entire arena, and this road 
encircles the wall. The road is in very poor shape, with huge gaps of it having
been taken over by grass and weeds. The wall is in equally poor shape, with 
huge gaps having fallen down as time takes its toll. A particular gap to the 
south gives one a glimpse of a forest that seems to have established itself 
within the arena grounds themselves. A sleek black hound stands stone still, 
ears perked and alert. Myrmidon Kheoss Nessaja is here, shrouded. He wields a 
curved sabre in each hand. Jimek Qaqyesil, Emir of the Dance is here. He wields

(southeast) 
H:309 M:281 E:1449 W:1624 <eb db> 
Path around the walls. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The path circling the walls is cracked and uneven, roots of plantlife having 
grown under the stone itself. Clumps of grass poke up from within the cracks, 
and small white daisies are dotted here and there, and between the gaps in the 
path, you can spot the hard wood of tree roots wreathing in the earth beneath. 
The wall to the east of the path is crumbling slowly, and looks unsafe to touch
as if it might fall at any moment.
You see exits leading south and northwest.
H:309 M:283 E:1448 W:1623 <eb db> (south) 
Next to an ivy-covered wall. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
Thick, vibrant ivy has over-grown the whole of the arena wall here, slowly 
adding to the crumbling of the stone as its roots work their way across. Almost
as if a green curtain had been thrown over wall itself, the ivy is a testament 
to the ages that have past since this place was constructed. Tendrils wreath 
the floor with thick vines, threatening to entangle your feet, and there 
appears to be a nest of some sort within the flora, left over from nesting 
years past.
You see exits leading north and south.
H:309 M:283 E:1448 W:1623 <eb db> (south) 
Near a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The ruined archway of this once-great arena lies just to the west, while the 
road continues in its circuitous route around the decaying walls. A thick 
marble pillar lies across the road here, broken into jagged pieces of varying 
size. The pillar came from inside the arena, ruining the wall with its 
tumultuous downfall, and lies across the entire road, here.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and west.
H:309 M:283 E:1448 W:1623 <eb db> (west) 
A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance 
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking 
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of 
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena 
walls to the southwest. Jimek Qaqyesil, Emir of the Dance is here. He wields a 
truesilver shield in his left hand and a strong broadsword in his right.
You see exits leading east, south, southwest, and northwest.

To the north, the great arches that once represented the triumphant gates of a 
mighty arena lie in near ruins. The road that winds around the walls of the

the road are visible more because of the various grasses and flowers that grow 
out of them than the black lines that would usually accompany such cracks.

(southeast)
H:309 M:281 E:1449 W:1624 &lt;eb db>
Path around the walls. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The path circling the walls is cracked and uneven, roots of plantlife having
grown under the stone itself. Clumps of grass poke up from within the cracks,
and small white daisies are dotted here and there, and between the gaps in the
path, you can spot the hard wood of tree roots wreathing in the earth beneath.
The wall to the east of the path is crumbling slowly, and looks unsafe to touch
as if it might fall at any moment.
You see exits leading south and northwest.
H:309 M:283 E:1448 W:1623 &lt;eb db> (south)
Next to an ivy-covered wall. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
Thick, vibrant ivy has over-grown the whole of the arena wall here, slowly
adding to the crumbling of the stone as its roots work their way across. Almost
as if a green curtain had been thrown over wall itself, the ivy is a testament
to the ages that have past since this place was constructed. Tendrils wreath
the floor with thick vines, threatening to entangle your feet, and there
appears to be a nest of some sort within the flora, left over from nesting
years past.
You see exits leading north and south.
H:309 M:283 E:1448 W:1623 &lt;eb db> (south)
Near a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The ruined archway of this once-great arena lies just to the west, while the
road continues in its circuitous route around the decaying walls. A thick
marble pillar lies across the road here, broken into jagged pieces of varying
size. The pillar came from inside the arena, ruining the wall with its
tumultuous downfall, and lies across the entire road, here.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and west.
H:309 M:283 E:1448 W:1623 &lt;eb db> (west)
A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena
walls to the southwest. Jimek Qaqyesil, Emir of the Dance is here. He wields a
truesilver shield in his left hand and a strong broadsword in his right.
You see exits leading east, south, southwest, and northwest.

South of a broken archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
To the north, the great arches that once represented the triumphant gates of a
mighty arena lie in near ruins. The road that winds around the walls of the
arena is in fairly decent state here, as most of it is whole. A few cracks in
the road are visible more because of the various grasses and flowers that grow
out of them than the black lines that would usually accompany such cracks.
