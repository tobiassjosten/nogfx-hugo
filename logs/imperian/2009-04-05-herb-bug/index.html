Aneirin cuts off his emanation of a word of power.

overwhelmed with joy at the sound. Your ears begin to grow numb, and the 
numbness spreads over your face, down your neck, growing throughout your entire

sight of your own marble body, a fine skein of thin flame wreathing over your 
chest and imprinting a short passage on your statue.

Aneirin cuts off his emanation of a word of power.
A single pure note rings in your ears, growing louder and louder as you are
overwhelmed with joy at the sound. Your ears begin to grow numb, and the
numbness spreads over your face, down your neck, growing throughout your entire
body. Your soul slips free from its mortal coils, and you are treated to a
sight of your own marble body, a fine skein of thin flame wreathing over your
chest and imprinting a short passage on your statue.
You have been slain by Aneirin.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
