Within a mighty pine tree. (Ithaquan Council.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A wide band of black encircling her neck,
a large ginger-furred silril pads here. A small, snow-white fox slinks about
the room. The extraordinary wingspan of an enormous black crow casts a grey
shadow upon everything around it, rendering the surroundings in a foreboding
black and white. A snowy white owl is perched here, his wise eyes gleaming with
inner fire. There are 3 pike with the head of Kyrock on its here. Mounted on an
Ithaquan arctic wolf, an Idrasi wolfrider scans the area with a cold stare.
A spiral staircase leads to the up, and a tall archway leads out (gate open).
