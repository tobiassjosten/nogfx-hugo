The forest is very thick here, trees blocking the view of the encircling walls 
of the ruins. A few large pieces of rock, rubble left over from various pillars
that used to stand here, lie on the ground, most of them covered with various 
forms of plant life as the forest slowly recovers. A rune like a lightning bolt
has been sketched into the ground here. Hovering in the air is a delicate 
songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. There are 3 throwing axes 
here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Azyel, Aspect of Aryana. 
He is holding a set of polished panpipes in his left hand.
You see a single exit leading northwest.

Rubble-filled path around the arena. (road). (Northwest Arena.)
The walls of the arena have nearly completely collapsed here, spilling rubble 
across the path that winds around the arena. Patches of weeds poke up through 
cracked sections of the hard rock of the path, while trees seem to be 
encroaching closer to the boundaries of the path as hard tree roots push their 
implacable bulk under the ground. The path continues to the south but it seems 
to the drop off suddenly in the distance.

A gaping hole is all that is left of the path, which seems to have suddenly 
collapsed here. It&#39;s quite clear that some sort of major natural event caused

The walls of the arena have nearly completely collapsed here, spilling rubble 
across the path that winds around the arena. Patches of weeds poke up through 
cracked sections of the hard rock of the path, while trees seem to be 
encroaching closer to the boundaries of the path as hard tree roots push their 
implacable bulk under the ground. The path continues to the south but it seems 
to the drop off suddenly in the distance. A peaceful aura fills the area,

The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an 
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken 
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is 
littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a 
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another 
path in the southeast of this chamber. A rune like a lightning bolt has been 
sketched into the ground here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from 
Azyel, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a small silver flute in his left hand and a 
small sketchbook in his right.
You see exits leading east, southeast, and up.

Tunnel paved with cobblestones. (lost) (Southwestern Arena.)
What was once the cobblestoned path of the arena has dropped, nearly intact, 
into the natural cave that was created by the natural disaster that formed this
underground system. A constant dripping noise in this tunnel indicates the 
presence of some water source traveling through the cracks in the solid rock 
that makes up the ceiling of this cave. Fresher air seems to be coming from the
west. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Azyel, Aspect of Aryana. 
He wields a small silver flute in his left hand and a small sketchbook in his

Abrupt end at a chasm. (road). (lost) (Northwest Arena.)
A gaping hole is all that is left of the path, which seems to have suddenly 
collapsed here. It&#39;s quite clear that some sort of major natural event caused 
the collapse of an entire section of the arena. A faint path can be picked out 
amongst the rubble leading under the ground. Little plant life grows here; the 
rock and gravel prevents much from taking root. A peaceful aura fills the area,
emanating from Azyel, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a small silver flute in his

Rubble-filled path around the arena. (road). (Northwest Arena.)
The walls of the arena have nearly completely collapsed here, spilling rubble
across the path that winds around the arena. Patches of weeds poke up through
cracked sections of the hard rock of the path, while trees seem to be
encroaching closer to the boundaries of the path as hard tree roots push their
implacable bulk under the ground. The path continues to the south but it seems
to the drop off suddenly in the distance.

Rock covered cave. (lost) (Southwestern Arena.)
The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is
littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another
path in the southeast of this chamber. A rune like a lightning bolt has been
sketched into the ground here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from
Azyel, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a small silver flute in his left hand and a
small sketchbook in his right.
You see exits leading east, southeast, and up.

Abrupt end at a chasm. (road). (lost) (Northwest Arena.)
A gaping hole is all that is left of the path, which seems to have suddenly
collapsed here. It's quite clear that some sort of major natural event caused
the collapse of an entire section of the arena. A faint path can be picked out
amongst the rubble leading under the ground. Little plant life grows here; the
rock and gravel prevents much from taking root. A peaceful aura fills the area,
emanating from Azyel, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a small silver flute in his
