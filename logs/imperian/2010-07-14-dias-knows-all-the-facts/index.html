my soul. However, the point lies in her speech. She insulted me speaking of how
"She would gain entrance to this city because she has connections" and that she
would gain a majority vote because she had assured it. I do not like this talk
because it gardners that she is acting like a Stavennite still.

Too many times have we allowed some one who would "Be able to spill blood for
Antioch" into our city only to have them leave a year or two later and havoc us
with their raids once more. I refuse to see this again. I implore you all to
vote not to have her citizened once again. She was removed from Stavenn from
disrespect and that is directly what I was told by a citizen. She did not quit.
