A hidden mine shaft. (Vorrak Mines.)
A piece of stone sticks out from the wall, its jagged point smoothed from use. 
The skeletal remains of a rogue bandit lie here, twin blades rusting nearby. An
ogre watchman stands here ready and armed for battle. Plodding along on his 
assigned task, an orc miner stops to catch a quick breath.
You see exits leading up (closed door), and a wooden ladder leads down.
