Dregaur has been harassing me on a continual basis, acting in a manner above 
and beyond what his role as a megalomaniac while in character. He has killed me
multiple times, and given me repeated CDF's whenever he's bored, even when I am
not even an active player, I return to the game to find messages from the 
system stating that he has disfavoured me, although by that time, I don't even 
know what reason he's given that time. I have lost city ranks due to him, with 
having done nothing since our political head to head some decades ago. I do not
speak to him, I do not have any contact with him, and as a matter of principle,
I completely avoid him. After he's done things to me, such as his most recent 
random CDF, I get messages and tells from others consoling me or apologizing to
me for the way he acts, but whenever I speak to an Ephor or minister or the 
Imperator, the very elected officials of the city, they each say that they can 
do nothing at all to help me. With no IC means of correction available to me, 
and speaking with Dregaur being unproductive, I turn now to the administration 
for intervenance. An example of his frivilous acts is his most recent:
