Aryana's Spring. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant clouds. A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. A small sign points into a market stall. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A partially-burnt letter has been left here carelessly. A pike with the decapitated head of Sam has been erected. An ornately-carved ivory pipe has been left behind. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. The crushed translucent body of a bloodworm lies here in a pool of blood. Brother Fen Elarien is here. Pareze is here. She is holding a tower shield in her left hand. Ander is here, hidden. He wields a lunar shield in his left hand and Insidian's Bane in his right. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. 
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway leads down.
