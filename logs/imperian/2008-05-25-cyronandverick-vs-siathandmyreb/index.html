A stone path leading through the hills. (road).
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. Waving
ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles listlessly 
in the dry wind. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on 
the ground.

Southern side of Gorge. (road).
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. There 
are 2 monolith sigils here. A long slab of stone sitting upon two small 
boulders offers rest for the weary. A wooden torch has been stuck into the 
ground, ready to be lit at nightfall. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, 
a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. The 
ever-shifting visage of Siath, Aspect of Moradeim, is here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, southwest, and west.

Driven by the scent of fresh blood, the leech leaps and attaches itself to 
Siath.
A mess of green slime envelops Siath quickly.
<482/402h 286/238m 1794e 787w 91x <ebpp> <bd>>

mammoth named Saynt.

Verick touches a tattoo and suddenly the ground splits open as a nightmarish 
tentacle shoots skywards, dragging Siath back to earth.
Siath falls from above, landing with a sickening crunch.

An enormous, white woolly mammoth named Saynt comes falling down from above to

are 2 monolith sigils here. A long slab of stone sitting upon two small 
boulders offers rest for the weary. A wooden torch has been stuck into the 
ground, ready to be lit at nightfall. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, 
flexing its long wiry antennae. A crackling demon orb floats and bobs here. A 
hand-sized tick quivers on the ground. The shimmering form of a soulmaster 
floats in the air. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly 
mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. The ever-shifting visage of 
Siath, Aspect of Moradeim, is here. Initiate of the Sanguine, Verick Iscariot 
is here. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a tower shield in his 
right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, southwest, and west.
<482/402h 281/238m 1794e 787w 91x <--pp> <bd>>

Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. There 
are 2 monolith sigils here. A long slab of stone sitting upon two small 
boulders offers rest for the weary. A wooden torch has been stuck into the 
ground, ready to be lit at nightfall. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, 
a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. A mutated 
humanoid rat sniffs about, reeking of filth. Initiate of the Sanguine, Verick 
Iscariot is here. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a tower shield 
in his right.

flexing its long wiry antennae. A crackling demon orb floats and bobs here. A
hand-sized tick quivers on the ground. The shimmering form of a soulmaster
floats in the air. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly
mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. The ever-shifting visage of
Siath, Aspect of Moradeim, is here. Initiate of the Sanguine, Verick Iscariot
