Crossing a shaky causeway. (road). (North Eastern Arena.)
The causeway shakes with the wind as time and erosion has slowly worn down the 
posts keeping it fastened to the two pillars. The causeway descends towards the
northeast as it approaches the shorter pillar while the taller pillar to the 
west provides a birds eye view of the entire arena. A large wall of stone 
stands here, blocking passage to the west. Lord Ozreas al-Hamasa is riding on a
massive warhorse. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a weathered 
silver shield in his right.

This narrow pillar is the highest point for miles around, and a vision of the

depression caused by the minor earthquake that collapsed that portion of the 
arena. Underneath you, and slightly to the southeast, the arena has been 
reclaimed by the forest, while further to the southeast the ruined arches of 
the great arena proclaim the entrance to the arena grounds. Lord Ozreas 
al-Hamasa is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields a curved sabre in his left
hand and a weathered silver shield in his right.

Crossing a shaky causeway. (road).
The causeway shakes with the wind as time and erosion has slowly worn down the 
posts keeping it fastened to the two pillars. The causeway descends towards the
northeast as it approaches the shorter pillar while the taller pillar to the 
west provides a birds eye view of the entire arena. A rune circle has been 
sketched into the ground here. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive 
warhorse stands here imperially. Ozreas, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling 
the surroundings with a miasma of fear. He wields a curved sabre in his left 
hand and a weathered silver shield in his right.

passage to the west. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse

passage to the west. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse
stands here imperially. Ozreas, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the

On a crumbling pillar. (road).
This narrow pillar is the highest point for miles around, and a vision of the
entire ruined arena is laid out before you. To the southwest, you see the deep
depression caused by the minor earthquake that collapsed that portion of the
arena. Underneath you, and slightly to the southeast, the arena has been
reclaimed by the forest, while further to the southeast the ruined arches of
the great arena proclaim the entrance to the arena grounds. Lord Ozreas
al-Hamasa is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields a curved sabre in his left
hand and a weathered silver shield in his right.
You see exits leading east and down.

You launch yourself into the air at Ozreas.
Crossing a shaky causeway. (road).
The causeway shakes with the wind as time and erosion has slowly worn down the
posts keeping it fastened to the two pillars. The causeway descends towards the
northeast as it approaches the shorter pillar while the taller pillar to the
west provides a birds eye view of the entire arena. A rune circle has been
sketched into the ground here. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive
warhorse stands here imperially. Ozreas, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling
the surroundings with a miasma of fear. He wields a curved sabre in his left
hand and a weathered silver shield in his right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.
A numbing energy runs up your limbs as your attack rebounds off of Ozreas's
shield.
