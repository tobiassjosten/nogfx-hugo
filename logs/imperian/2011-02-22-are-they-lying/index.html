If NoGFX is going to become clean and safe to match the forums then that&rsquo;s a decision beyond my reach to contest, but it&rsquo;ll certainly be an extremely disappointing day and a reversal of what we&rsquo;ve been assured of.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92467a33c20ef4c2d82bb7101089334b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dgroz093@xxx on 28 Feb 2011</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know where in my post I gave the impression that I approve of everything that&rsquo;s ever been posted on here and think none of the logs up should have been deleted.

I can&rsquo;t even begin to tell you how much that wearies me. I&rsquo;m not a moralfag and I think you know me to be pretty liberal when it comes to personally attacking other people in an effort to generate lulz. However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s embarking on a moral crusade to say there is a difference between an Imperian log in which some moron says &ldquo;HOW COULD YOU PK ME, MY BUDDY JUST BLED OUT IN MY ARMS WHILE WE WERE HUNTING OSAMA?!?!?!&rdquo; and what amounted to a diatribe by someone claiming to be a person who once played Imperian.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1926e216bda1b3a8c63459c63464bf85?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by ashel@xxx on 28 Feb 2011</p><p>There was no tentative connection to the game at all, you might not have known the players involved but many of us did. It&rsquo;s no less relevant than my spat with Dias, quite honestly. Less funny? Maybe. But that&rsquo;s insanely subjective. Hell, we&rsquo;ve had Intisar&rsquo;s forum rant sitting here for ages, as well as that one mudsex forum post (which you gave an A+ in the comments).</p><p>Also, yes, I tend to bristle at things like &lsquo;hur dur this isn&rsquo;t /b/&rsquo; and a Guardas-esque commentary about how drama pleases only horrible people. It does irritate me to hear you of all people saying that.</p><p>All told, the deletion was absolutely a modification to what we previously knew to be &lsquo;acceptable&rsquo;, which is that&rsquo;s exactly why I made my comments in the first place.
