Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Brothers..."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "You may have noticed that many walk within our corridors."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Learn all they can of our skills."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "And leave."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "You may notice that there is little 
fervour in the eyes of the young."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "And that there is often the echoes of 
ancient conflict reflected in the words of the old."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We have come far, it is true, in pursuing our grasp at divinity."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "However, I think that not much has truly progressed."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We have a strong tradition - and indeed, throwing it away would be a grave mistake."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "However, ceasing to build upon it is just as foolish."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Just this month."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I saw two of our brethren caught in a 
misunderstanding."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Over eager to shed blood and wound pride."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "And I wonder to myself, why? I call you 
all brother, do I not? I call you all sister?"

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Is is true, we preach self-reliance."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We work our bodies, hone our minds, and 
train our spirits to soar so that we may reach heights unknown to mortals."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "But all this, I believe, is for naught if we do not recognize that our greatest strength is as community united in this pursuit."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We are not Monks of Manoa because of our skills."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We are not Monks of Manoa because of where we are."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "It is not even our fight that makes us 
such."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I think we know."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I&#39;ve said it - and I&#39;ll say it again - we are a /singular/ community in pursuit of Enlightenment through Divine 
guidance."

Gelf takes a drink from a sun-etched isan vial.

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "There /are/ no other monks."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Sure, a Dunestrider may call himself 
monk."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "A Justicar."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "A Rogue."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "But that does make them monks."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Does not, rather."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Brethren."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We&#39;re the only monks there are. We&#39;re the only Manoans, the only ones who truly follow the Way."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "It is up to /us/ to uphold this, to shed the fallacies of the past and continue our search...a community /united/."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I have several ideas I would like to put in place, in order foster just that."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "And I hope we find, together, the strength we strive for."

Diaktoros clears his throat in an attempt to gain your attention.

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "The floor is now open."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Let me know if you wish to speak, in 
tells."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Sister Gelf has the floor."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "It has come over the years that certain people have gain entrance into our guild and that some have been not quite happy about such a decision."

Diaktoros nods his head.

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "One thing I would like to propose happen, is that a referendum be held for inguilding members."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "By all means this does not mean everyone."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "But there are questionable people who perhaps 
should not be granted for certain reasons and I believe we all have a right to voice our concerns on this."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "There has been disruptions in the guild over this and inclinations of people leaving with reasons including this."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "If we are who you say we are, we all deserve a 
voice and a choice in such matters pertaining to the guild."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "The second thing I&#39;d like to bring up."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Is people&#39;s tolerance of magickers."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Is has been a long standing issue that arises 
everywhere."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "But I have noticed first hand that such things 
occur."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Both Manoans and magickers, even demoners 
conversing."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity crosses her arms slowly as she 
listens.

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "And not just the typical debates one would expect."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "But being snuggly and friendly."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "I myself have been a magicker, yes. I know all too 
well the taint they hold and what harm these people can bring to us."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Thusly, I&#39;d like to see a crack down on 
fraternizing with magickers and demoners."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says to Diaktoros, "And the floor is back to you."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "It is now Sister Scarlette&#39;s."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Both in regards to what 
Sister Gelf has mentioned."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "It is in my opinion that if we were to do a referendum for certain people, those who could cause trouble within the guild, that we would be seen as too selective. This can be either good or bad depending on how strongly it was enforced.. to this I only offer that it be a modified. if too many people seem to disagree to a persons joining.."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Then feel free for a 
referendum of the situation. But Probationary period is also used for these 
things, keep them a bit under a close eye for a year or two."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "As for the other. if we 
crack down too hard on our interaction with Magickers and Demoners, then how 
will we ever ease into their heads and urge them to convert?"

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "The first step in converting someone, is to be their friend, not always so cuddly snugly, nay, That I agree should still be forbidden and strictly watched."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "But I know had I not had I not still been friends with Laethus when I was a Demoner, I would not be here now, for I would have felt no urge to come here because I felt done would want me. I have had a terrible past and many do not trust me. I accept that."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Diplomacy leads to an open mind and better sight into how others think and act. if we can show we are not so bad and be slightly friendly, then perhaps we have a better chance at converting someone, showing them the way."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says to Diaktoros, "Suppose that is all I have to share. Opinion wise."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "The floor is Brother Jarrhn&#39;s."

You say, "Thank you."

You say, "First thing I have to say, we may have a probationary period as 
Sister Scarlette says, it also stands to say, that during such period it is 
entirely possible to fake being acceptable. That while we are not around to 
keep an eye on them, they can stray from our rules and beliefs to do their own thing. We have a few members who have had questionable pasts, they may have proven themselves loyal, but we&#39;re lost at times, twice as many of our loyal brothers or sisters. This is why Sister Gelf suggested the referendum system."

You say, "And for one, I would agree to holding a referendum for people me may not be able to trust fully."

You say, "The second point, while we may try to convert people to our way of 
life. It&#39;s not always necessary to consort with these types on a social level. We shouldn&#39;t need to trick them into it with promises of friendships or power. They should listen to our views and take them into consideration and hope that they will correct their own opinions of the path they travel. It is better to have people join our ranks to follow our views than to have them join because their friend is here."

You say, "And lastly, while I can accept and agree with the synergy and 
strengthening we&#39;re hoping to achieve. I&#39;m not entirely sure that throwing away our past traditions, titles and old way of life was a drastic but necessary action. However before I can become adamant of this view, I would like to continue observing these changes, and see where it will lead us. We may not follow the Scorpion and Dragon conflict anymore, we cannot deny that this is our history. We shouldn&#39;t go in ignorance of our past, otherwise our future could never get stronger. We will not learn from our mistakes if we choose to ignore them."

You say, "And that is all I have to say. Thank you."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I will take the floor, in order to address the points made."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Firstly, regarding questionable members. Certain potential members should undergo the scrutiny of Manoa, and a referendum is adequate implementation. However, first, we require definition. What constitutes a potential troublemaker, beyond history? Were we to go by history alone, then every one of us here, excepting the two of us who have been Antiochan all our life, would be under scrutiny. You, Sister Gelf, were once listed as a permanent enemy - and the same holds true for you, Brother Jarrhn. Brother Galvin was a magicker, and we know Sister Scarlette&#39;s past."

You nod your head.

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "So if not history, what then, do we 
qualify &#39;questionable candidates&#39; by?"

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "As of this moment, I am currently unsure as to how to define this. That said, there are some with whom this blatantly apparent,."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Such as Brother Dias, and so, I propose 
that we start by posting a referendum for him. For now, I believe he serves as adequate marker."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Until such a time as we come up with a 
definitive description of such candidates, I will leave it to the discretion of the Council."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Secondly, fraternization with magickers."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "True fraternization will be punished 
severely, however, the problem with this, as in most similiar crimes, is 
evidence."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "True fraternization, I believe, consists, first and foremost, of seeing the tainted as, essentially, untainted."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Thus, it&#39;s something that begins in our 
minds. Besides that, I propose that we introduce a vehicle for identifying 
fraternizers."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Specifically, that any Brethren who 
suspect another of the crime should, discretely and privately, inform the 
Council of their suspicions. When this is done, the Council should conduct a 
thorough clandestine investigation to determine the perpetrator&#39;s innocence or guilt."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "The floor is Sister Gelf&#39;s."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Whilst I believe your ideas of true fraternization are correct, I don&#39;t believe that every other kind should be overlooked. If someone if befriending one of those two circles, sharing a personal relationship, chatting like old friends, snuggling, cuddling and whatever, I do believe they should still be held accountable for such whether they see them as being a demoner or magicker or not."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "If someone is rather."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Truth be told I was one, yes. All the more reason I
know the taint they have on people."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "As for referendums. Yes I was enemied to the guild.
I was enemied for holding the class outside of the guild."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "That was not my choice to leave."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "It was the decision of one of the oh so beloved 
Grand Masters before you Diaktoros, who didn&#39;t think I could move with guild."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "I don&#39;t see how my situation is questionable 
compared to those from either demonic or magicker circles."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "They don&#39;t even need be from those circles to be 
quesionable."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Yes, Dias is one that caused huge problems."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "But we need to consider guild and profession 
hoppers also."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Yes, well enough that they may be from Antioch and should hold the same beliefs somewhat, but that doesn&#39;t mean they should be given a chance if their intentions are not set right."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "How we distinguish that? Well, that I cannot tell you. We may not be elite like some, but we can still choose who we wish to join our ranks for whatever reason we wish."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "As Diaktoros brought up earlier, people come and 
learn our skills then they&#39;re gone."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "We cannot foresee who these people will be, that we all know."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "But we all know there are also reputations that 
lead to gaining the knowledge required for the more mature members."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "And that&#39;s all I can think of at this time."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Unless any others wish to speak."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We come to the Vote."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Sister Scarlette."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Thank you."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "This on a slightly different topic. We, as a guild, I believe, should be able to do activities together other than hunting or small contests here and there, to bring us all together. I propose a celebration of sorts to be held here in the Monastery. Food, activities to be done, mini contests with prizes.. have abit of fun, learn about each other, tell stories.."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Everything within said 
celebration can be decided by all, by having people send in ideas for 
activities. Get donations to support the prizes and all."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says to Diaktoros, "Yeah.. all i 
wanted to suggest."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says to Scarlette, "A Manoan Retreat was planned,
but there was no interest. Hopefully, that&#39;s changed."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "And now, the Vote."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Issue #1: Member Eligibility."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "All those in favour of referendums, say 
Aye."

You say, "Aye."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Aye."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Aye."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Aye."

"Aye," Galvin mutters aloud.

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Passed. All those in favour of a 
referendum for Brother Dias, say aye."

Sister Scarlette Dra&#39;Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Aye."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Aye."

You say, "Aye."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Passed."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Issue #2. Fraternization Issues. All those in favour of my proposal, say Aye. If there are any other ideas, let me know."

You say, "Aye."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Aye."

"Aye," Galvin mutters aloud.

"Aye," Scarlette mutters aloud.

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Passed."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I think that is it, unless there was 
anything I missed?"

You say, "Not as this time. Nay."

Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Not that I can think of."

Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "In that case, the Synod is closed. Thank you all for attending - I will be posting a summary some time in the next month."'>Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I will initiate this Synod, unless there are any objections."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Brothers..."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "You may have noticed that many walk within our corridors."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Learn all they can of our skills."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "And leave."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "You may notice that there is little
fervour in the eyes of the young."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "And that there is often the echoes of
ancient conflict reflected in the words of the old."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We have come far, it is true, in pursuing our grasp at divinity."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "However, I think that not much has truly progressed."

Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "The first step in converting someone, is to be their friend, not always so cuddly snugly, nay, That I agree should still be forbidden and strictly watched."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "But I know had I not had I not still been friends with Laethus when I was a Demoner, I would not be here now, for I would have felt no urge to come here because I felt done would want me. I have had a terrible past and many do not trust me. I accept that."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Diplomacy leads to an open mind and better sight into how others think and act. if we can show we are not so bad and be slightly friendly, then perhaps we have a better chance at converting someone, showing them the way."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says to Diaktoros, "Suppose that is all I have to share. Opinion wise."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "The floor is Brother Jarrhn's."
You say, "Thank you."
You say, "First thing I have to say, we may have a probationary period as
Sister Scarlette says, it also stands to say, that during such period it is
entirely possible to fake being acceptable. That while we are not around to
keep an eye on them, they can stray from our rules and beliefs to do their own thing. We have a few members who have had questionable pasts, they may have proven themselves loyal, but we're lost at times, twice as many of our loyal brothers or sisters. This is why Sister Gelf suggested the referendum system."
You say, "And for one, I would agree to holding a referendum for people me may not be able to trust fully."
You say, "The second point, while we may try to convert people to our way of
life. It's not always necessary to consort with these types on a social level. We shouldn't need to trick them into it with promises of friendships or power. They should listen to our views and take them into consideration and hope that they will correct their own opinions of the path they travel. It is better to have people join our ranks to follow our views than to have them join because their friend is here."
You say, "And lastly, while I can accept and agree with the synergy and
strengthening we're hoping to achieve. I'm not entirely sure that throwing away our past traditions, titles and old way of life was a drastic but necessary action. However before I can become adamant of this view, I would like to continue observing these changes, and see where it will lead us. We may not follow the Scorpion and Dragon conflict anymore, we cannot deny that this is our history. We shouldn't go in ignorance of our past, otherwise our future could never get stronger. We will not learn from our mistakes if we choose to ignore them."
You say, "And that is all I have to say. Thank you."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I will take the floor, in order to address the points made."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Firstly, regarding questionable members. Certain potential members should undergo the scrutiny of Manoa, and a referendum is adequate implementation. However, first, we require definition. What constitutes a potential troublemaker, beyond history? Were we to go by history alone, then every one of us here, excepting the two of us who have been Antiochan all our life, would be under scrutiny. You, Sister Gelf, were once listed as a permanent enemy - and the same holds true for you, Brother Jarrhn. Brother Galvin was a magicker, and we know Sister Scarlette's past."
You nod your head.
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "So if not history, what then, do we
qualify 'questionable candidates' by?"
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "As of this moment, I am currently unsure as to how to define this. That said, there are some with whom this blatantly apparent,."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Such as Brother Dias, and so, I propose
that we start by posting a referendum for him. For now, I believe he serves as adequate marker."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Until such a time as we come up with a
definitive description of such candidates, I will leave it to the discretion of the Council."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Secondly, fraternization with magickers."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "True fraternization will be punished
severely, however, the problem with this, as in most similiar crimes, is
evidence."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "True fraternization, I believe, consists, first and foremost, of seeing the tainted as, essentially, untainted."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Thus, it's something that begins in our
minds. Besides that, I propose that we introduce a vehicle for identifying
fraternizers."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Specifically, that any Brethren who
suspect another of the crime should, discretely and privately, inform the
Council of their suspicions. When this is done, the Council should conduct a
thorough clandestine investigation to determine the perpetrator's innocence or guilt."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "The floor is Sister Gelf's."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Whilst I believe your ideas of true fraternization are correct, I don't believe that every other kind should be overlooked. If someone if befriending one of those two circles, sharing a personal relationship, chatting like old friends, snuggling, cuddling and whatever, I do believe they should still be held accountable for such whether they see them as being a demoner or magicker or not."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "If someone is rather."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Truth be told I was one, yes. All the more reason I
know the taint they have on people."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "As for referendums. Yes I was enemied to the guild.
I was enemied for holding the class outside of the guild."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "That was not my choice to leave."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "It was the decision of one of the oh so beloved
Grand Masters before you Diaktoros, who didn't think I could move with guild."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "I don't see how my situation is questionable
compared to those from either demonic or magicker circles."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "They don't even need be from those circles to be
quesionable."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Yes, Dias is one that caused huge problems."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "But we need to consider guild and profession
hoppers also."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Yes, well enough that they may be from Antioch and should hold the same beliefs somewhat, but that doesn't mean they should be given a chance if their intentions are not set right."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "How we distinguish that? Well, that I cannot tell you. We may not be elite like some, but we can still choose who we wish to join our ranks for whatever reason we wish."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "As Diaktoros brought up earlier, people come and
learn our skills then they're gone."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "We cannot foresee who these people will be, that we all know."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "But we all know there are also reputations that
lead to gaining the knowledge required for the more mature members."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "And that's all I can think of at this time."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Unless any others wish to speak."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "We come to the Vote."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Sister Scarlette."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Thank you."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "This on a slightly different topic. We, as a guild, I believe, should be able to do activities together other than hunting or small contests here and there, to bring us all together. I propose a celebration of sorts to be held here in the Monastery. Food, activities to be done, mini contests with prizes.. have abit of fun, learn about each other, tell stories.."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Everything within said
celebration can be decided by all, by having people send in ideas for
activities. Get donations to support the prizes and all."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says to Diaktoros, "Yeah.. all i
wanted to suggest."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says to Scarlette, "A Manoan Retreat was planned,
but there was no interest. Hopefully, that's changed."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "And now, the Vote."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Issue #1: Member Eligibility."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "All those in favour of referendums, say
Aye."
You say, "Aye."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Aye."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Aye."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Aye."
"Aye," Galvin mutters aloud.
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Passed. All those in favour of a
referendum for Brother Dias, say aye."
Sister Scarlette Dra'Nyk, Avowed of Charity says, "Aye."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Aye."
You say, "Aye."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Passed."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Issue #2. Fraternization Issues. All those in favour of my proposal, say Aye. If there are any other ideas, let me know."
You say, "Aye."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Aye."
"Aye," Galvin mutters aloud.
"Aye," Scarlette mutters aloud.
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "Passed."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "I think that is it, unless there was
anything I missed?"
You say, "Not as this time. Nay."
Sister Gelf Tellaris says, "Not that I can think of."
Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas says, "In that case, the Synod is closed. Thank you all for attending - I will be posting a summary some time in the next month."</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+1 points with 1 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcd10b15095f431c24ced7dcfd20ee1b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by metrowolf12@xxx on 12Â Mar 2010</p>tl;dr</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66ffdc41d709c0193f54d7ebad4b4822?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by jarrhn@xxx (author) on 12Â Mar 2010</p>Well I did put a warning in the comment section. :/</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9709d27e0c92499c995b65a9553028e0?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by tonykunz@xxx on 12Â Mar 2010</p>Pretty good, see how the Taekyon will turn out</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx on 13Â Mar 2010</p>Meh, the Taekyon are a shadow of their former selves and I highly doubt Diaktoros is going to be able to change that.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3fd57273d1cd45f320a85ecd7ad20bec?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by falcon32252003@xxx on 13Â Mar 2010</p>Can&rsquo;t help but try.
