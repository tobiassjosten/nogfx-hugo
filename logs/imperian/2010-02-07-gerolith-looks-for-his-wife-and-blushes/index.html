The Mounted Cephyreid.
The focal point of this tavern is the huge iron pot that has been suspended 
from the ceiling by four blackened chains, beneath this pot the wooded 
floorboards have been pulled back and dark stone has been set into the floor in
their place. The tavern itself is circular in shape, with a long, curved bar 
set against the one wall. Above the dark oak bar, there are shelves containing 
a multitude of dusty bottles, on the floor behind it there are wide wine racks 
and massive barrels. Hanging from the ceiling above the bar is a mounted 
cephyreid, its limbs dangling limply from the oaken plaque. The cephyreid has 
been impaled through its fleshy skin with a pair of ivory sitaras, as well as a
hafted glaive. The blades of these weapons are stained with the dead creature&#39;s
blood, which is slowly decomposing. Arranged around the room there are several 
circular tables with seating, all crafted from the same luxurious dark oak. In 
front of the hanging fire, there is a large bearskin rug, the hair thick and 
comfortable to the touch, thrown here for Nils to rest upon. The walls of this 
tavern are bare and practical,lined with only a few small shelves set with a 
variety of candles that cast light across the large space. This has been marked
as holy ground. Lined with spartan stools, a wide bar runs the length of the 
rear wall. A weary old wolf lies in the corner upon a ratty rug, half-asleep. 
Sitting at the end of the bar is an impressive wolf&#39;s head which has been 
mounted on an ironwood base. Magaelan is here, holding aloft a rather large 
mug. A backless swivel stool sits here. The extraordinary wingspan of an 
enormous black crow casts a grey shadow upon everything around it, rendering 
the surroundings in a foreboding black and white. A large, gold flecked hawk 
hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the light. A fur 
trimmed tapestry of hide, the Wendigo of Ithaqua depicted ominously in its 
center, hangs from the wall here. Balanced easily on its oversized hind paws, a
Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with its huge, blue eyes. 
There are 3 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. A dead rat has been left here. 
Gerolith, self proclaimed God of Might stands here, his tankard held ready. 
There are 12 wooden mug of Warden&#39;s Milks here. A peaceful aura fills the area,
emanating from Surakai, Aspect of Aryana. Iolana Askare, Falcon&#39;s Cry is here, 
camouflaged. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to 
see what is for sale.

He is an astute Tanari. He is just a few inches shy of six foot in height. 
Tousled dark brown hair falls in waves to his shoulders, with three tight 
braids, each one a little longer than the other, extending from slightly above 
his right temple to below his jawline.  Into the first two braids, small bones 
are woven in a manner that minimizes any sound they may make. The third braid 
holds two small ivory rings that were carved from one bone so that they are 
intertwined and yet complete individual rings. Broad shoulders top his medium 
build and lend gravity to a dark muscular frame that moves with a rugged grace.
His facial features are non-descript for members of his race, except for 
exceptionally pronounced canine teeth that speak of a carnivorous predatory 
nature.  He has dark green eyes with flecks of soft grey. Not unlike snow 
falling in the dark pines, his eyes exude a cold mournful solitude. He is 
wearing a gnawed ring of bone, a leather armband, a handsome silver etched 
ring, a worn arctic falconry glove, rugged black leather boots, rugged black 
leather trousers, a sturdy black leather pack, a worn vagabond cloak of black 
fur, a banded shield, a warm and rugged black shirt, a leather-strapped knife 
belt, a black forearm sheath, a pair of matte shark-skin gloves, 2 sleek black 
leather wrist sheaths, a suit of leather armour, an Ithaquan sheath, a pair of 
leather greaves, a leather helm, a pair of leather vambraces, and a pair of 
blackened iron spurs. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand and a tower 
shield in his right.

The Mounted Cephyreid.
The focal point of this tavern is the huge iron pot that has been suspended 
from the ceiling by four blackened chains, beneath this pot the wooded 
floorboards have been pulled back and dark stone has been set into the floor in
their place. The tavern itself is circular in shape, with a long, curved bar 
set against the one wall. Above the dark oak bar, there are shelves containing 
a multitude of dusty bottles, on the floor behind it there are wide wine racks 
and massive barrels. Hanging from the ceiling above the bar is a mounted 
cephyreid, its limbs dangling limply from the oaken plaque. The cephyreid has 
been impaled through its fleshy skin with a pair of ivory sitaras, as well as a
hafted glaive. The blades of these weapons are stained with the dead creature&#39;s
blood, which is slowly decomposing. Arranged around the room there are several 
circular tables with seating, all crafted from the same luxurious dark oak. In 
front of the hanging fire, there is a large bearskin rug, the hair thick and 
comfortable to the touch, thrown here for Nils to rest upon. The walls of this 
tavern are bare and practical,lined with only a few small shelves set with a 
variety of candles that cast light across the large space. This has been marked
as holy ground. Lined with spartan stools, a wide bar runs the length of the 
rear wall. A weary old wolf lies in the corner upon a ratty rug, half-asleep. 
Sitting at the end of the bar is an impressive wolf&#39;s head which has been 
mounted on an ironwood base. Magaelan is here, holding aloft a rather large 
mug. A backless swivel stool sits here. The extraordinary wingspan of an 
enormous black crow casts a grey shadow upon everything around it, rendering 
the surroundings in a foreboding black and white. A large, gold flecked hawk 
hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the light. A fur 
trimmed tapestry of hide, the Wendigo of Ithaqua depicted ominously in its 
center, hangs from the wall here. Balanced easily on its oversized hind paws, a
Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with its huge, blue eyes. 
There are 3 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. A dead rat has been left here. 
Gerolith, self proclaimed God of Might stands here, his tankard held ready. 
There are 12 wooden mug of Warden&#39;s Milks here. A peaceful aura fills the area,
emanating from Surakai, Aspect of Aryana. Iolana Askare, Falcon&#39;s Cry is here,

The Mounted Cephyreid.
The focal point of this tavern is the huge iron pot that has been suspended
from the ceiling by four blackened chains, beneath this pot the wooded
floorboards have been pulled back and dark stone has been set into the floor in
their place. The tavern itself is circular in shape, with a long, curved bar
set against the one wall. Above the dark oak bar, there are shelves containing
a multitude of dusty bottles, on the floor behind it there are wide wine racks
and massive barrels. Hanging from the ceiling above the bar is a mounted
cephyreid, its limbs dangling limply from the oaken plaque. The cephyreid has
been impaled through its fleshy skin with a pair of ivory sitaras, as well as a
hafted glaive. The blades of these weapons are stained with the dead creature's
blood, which is slowly decomposing. Arranged around the room there are several
circular tables with seating, all crafted from the same luxurious dark oak. In
front of the hanging fire, there is a large bearskin rug, the hair thick and
comfortable to the touch, thrown here for Nils to rest upon. The walls of this
tavern are bare and practical,lined with only a few small shelves set with a
variety of candles that cast light across the large space. This has been marked
as holy ground. Lined with spartan stools, a wide bar runs the length of the
rear wall. A weary old wolf lies in the corner upon a ratty rug, half-asleep.
Sitting at the end of the bar is an impressive wolf's head which has been
mounted on an ironwood base. Magaelan is here, holding aloft a rather large
mug. A backless swivel stool sits here. The extraordinary wingspan of an
enormous black crow casts a grey shadow upon everything around it, rendering
the surroundings in a foreboding black and white. A large, gold flecked hawk
hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the light. A fur
trimmed tapestry of hide, the Wendigo of Ithaqua depicted ominously in its
center, hangs from the wall here. Balanced easily on its oversized hind paws, a
Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with its huge, blue eyes.
There are 3 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. A dead rat has been left here.
Gerolith, self proclaimed God of Might stands here, his tankard held ready.
There are 12 wooden mug of Warden's Milks here. A peaceful aura fills the area,
emanating from Surakai, Aspect of Aryana. Iolana Askare, Falcon's Cry is here,
camouflaged. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to
see what is for sale.
You see a single exit leading out (open door).

He is an astute Tanari. He is just a few inches shy of six foot in height.
Tousled dark brown hair falls in waves to his shoulders, with three tight
braids, each one a little longer than the other, extending from slightly above
his right temple to below his jawline. Into the first two braids, small bones
are woven in a manner that minimizes any sound they may make. The third braid
holds two small ivory rings that were carved from one bone so that they are
intertwined and yet complete individual rings. Broad shoulders top his medium
build and lend gravity to a dark muscular frame that moves with a rugged grace.
His facial features are non-descript for members of his race, except for
exceptionally pronounced canine teeth that speak of a carnivorous predatory
nature. He has dark green eyes with flecks of soft grey. Not unlike snow
falling in the dark pines, his eyes exude a cold mournful solitude. He is
wearing a gnawed ring of bone, a leather armband, a handsome silver etched
ring, a worn arctic falconry glove, rugged black leather boots, rugged black
leather trousers, a sturdy black leather pack, a worn vagabond cloak of black
fur, a banded shield, a warm and rugged black shirt, a leather-strapped knife
belt, a black forearm sheath, a pair of matte shark-skin gloves, 2 sleek black
leather wrist sheaths, a suit of leather armour, an Ithaquan sheath, a pair of
leather greaves, a leather helm, a pair of leather vambraces, and a pair of
blackened iron spurs. He wields an ivory sitara in his left hand and a tower
shield in his right.

The Mounted Cephyreid.
The focal point of this tavern is the huge iron pot that has been suspended
from the ceiling by four blackened chains, beneath this pot the wooded
floorboards have been pulled back and dark stone has been set into the floor in
their place. The tavern itself is circular in shape, with a long, curved bar
set against the one wall. Above the dark oak bar, there are shelves containing
a multitude of dusty bottles, on the floor behind it there are wide wine racks
and massive barrels. Hanging from the ceiling above the bar is a mounted
cephyreid, its limbs dangling limply from the oaken plaque. The cephyreid has
been impaled through its fleshy skin with a pair of ivory sitaras, as well as a
hafted glaive. The blades of these weapons are stained with the dead creature's
blood, which is slowly decomposing. Arranged around the room there are several
circular tables with seating, all crafted from the same luxurious dark oak. In
front of the hanging fire, there is a large bearskin rug, the hair thick and
comfortable to the touch, thrown here for Nils to rest upon. The walls of this
tavern are bare and practical,lined with only a few small shelves set with a
variety of candles that cast light across the large space. This has been marked
as holy ground. Lined with spartan stools, a wide bar runs the length of the
rear wall. A weary old wolf lies in the corner upon a ratty rug, half-asleep.
Sitting at the end of the bar is an impressive wolf's head which has been
mounted on an ironwood base. Magaelan is here, holding aloft a rather large
mug. A backless swivel stool sits here. The extraordinary wingspan of an
enormous black crow casts a grey shadow upon everything around it, rendering
the surroundings in a foreboding black and white. A large, gold flecked hawk
hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the light. A fur
trimmed tapestry of hide, the Wendigo of Ithaqua depicted ominously in its
center, hangs from the wall here. Balanced easily on its oversized hind paws, a
Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with its huge, blue eyes.
There are 3 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. A dead rat has been left here.
Gerolith, self proclaimed God of Might stands here, his tankard held ready.
There are 11 wooden mug of Warden's Milks here. Iolana Askare, Falcon's Cry is
here, camouflaged. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Surakai,
Aspect of Aryana. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command
to see what is for sale.
You see a single exit leading out (open door).

Sommnus says, "If a gift you feel you must give, give something practical and
worthy of a God of Might. A fine fur cloak of beasts felled by your own mighty
hands. Not some weed plucked along the roadside."
&lt;340/340h 363/363m 1600e 1717w 0x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "So. If Ithaqua sees a beautiful woman who
looks like she needs to find a God in her life... Ithaqua knows what to do. And
Gerolith will keep looking and forget the silly bards and their advice!"

Gerolith, God of Might says, "And now, Gerolith, God of Might, will drink and

them nonetheless."
