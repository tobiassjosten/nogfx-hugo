You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Hello."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Can I help you?"
Poogad tells you, "Would you please give me a hand job?"
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Erm...excuse me?"
Poogad tells you, "Just inquiring."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Why?"
Poogad tells you, "I need one."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "And you ask me because ... ??"
Poogad tells you, "You are a girl."
Poogad tells you, "And considering you are married, I figured you were experienced."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "..."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "But you&#39;re a girl ... not a boy."
Poogad tells you, "And?"
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Annnnnd what makes you think I&#39;d betray my husband like this, and what makes you think I do that ... ?"
Poogad tells you, "Never hurts asking. You never know, somebody would do it."
Poogad tells you, "But the way you said betray my husband like this, implies you have already thought about it and in your mind the idea seemed pleasing."
Poogad tells you, "But that is just my psycho-evaluation."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Excuse me, who the dis gave you THAT idea!"
Poogad tells you, "Like this rather than like that is what you said. Like this implies that you have already committed adultery in your mind. Like that would imply that you have yet to do it and it is only a hypothetical situation that you find displeasing."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Am not a cheater, nor a whore, nor anything you think I am."
Poogad tells you, "Of course you aren&#39;t. I never said or implied that you are. Having a sexual encounter with another person doesn&#39;t make you any of those."
Poogad tells you, "I am sure you husband probably wouldn&#39;t even mind if he were involved as well."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "And you would assume that of my husband ... how?"  
Poogad tells you, "He is a man, he has a penis, need I explain further?"
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "My husband don&#39;t do that."
Poogad tells you, "Lol you had to ask him."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "How do you even know my husband?" 
Poogad tells you, "I don&#39;t. Just judging on how low it took you to repsond, I am assuming you went and asked if he would be interested."
Poogad tells you, "How long rather."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "My husband isn&#39;t even awake!"
Poogad tells you, "Doesn&#39;t mean you two can&#39;t communication."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "And you would know that ... how?"
Poogad tells you, "Common sense, most people that are married in the realms communicate in their sleep."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "And...if i haven&#39;t ..."
Poogad tells you, "Then I am wrong. But I assume I am probably right considering how you seem to have nervously spaced your letters there."
Poogad tells you, "Pretty smart huh." 
Poogad tells you, "You are probably asking him how he knows me and secretly suspecting he set this up, and he is swearing up and down he has no idea who the hell I am."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Really, now?"
Poogad tells you, "Indeed."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Only way you would know that, as if you knew him personally."
Poogad tells you, "Lol I was right."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Do you?"
Poogad tells you, "You ARE suspecting something."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Do i have reason to be?"
Poogad tells you, "No, I am just a freaky person that some people think is psychic, but I am not, I can just tell what people are thinking and what they are going to do next based on their behavior."
Poogad tells you, "I was just looking for someone to have some play fun with."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "*eye*."
Poogad tells you, "In which the offer is still on the table if you are interested, and I am sure your husband wouldn&#39;t mind. He is just scared to admit his true desires for a 3-way."
Poogad tells you, "That is what he wants you think. I am sure he feels like you would be upset if he admitted he likes the idea. It probably has to do with the way you ask him the question. Men can actually usually tell when a woman asked a question how she wants him to answer."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "You know it sounds like you are making my husband into a liar, a cheater, and some disgusting pervert, and which case, i KNOW he&#39;s not. My husband doesn&#39;t like share."
Poogad tells you, "Lol ... okay.. whatever you want to believe."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "How do you know him, or me in the matter?"
Poogad tells you, "If you aren&#39;t interested just say so."
Poogad tells you, "Like I said, I don&#39;t know either of you, just looking for some fun."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Somehow i know you are lying."
Poogad tells you, "You hope I am lying."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Actually I think you are *evilgrin*."
Poogad tells you, "Don&#39;t confuse thinking with hoping now." 
Poogad tells you, "."
Poogad tells you, "You see, you want to believe it, but you know deep down I am telling the truth."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Really..."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "How on dis would you assume that?"
Poogad tells you, "Does the sun rise every day?"
Poogad tells you, "It is true because we know it to be true, and it stands to reason."
Poogad tells you, "The methods of intuition and tenacity."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "I don&#39;t cheat on my husband, whether he was awake or sleeping. I love my husband and you just disgusted me in your way of thinking. and you are a liar, hands down."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "And you know that I am not, because you obviously think you know me."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "AND my husband."
Poogad tells you, "Like I said, the heart wants to believe but the mind knows the truth. I don&#39;t know you personally, I just know people and the nature of them. With those two concepts alone, one can find out anything they need to know about a person without that person telling them anything."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "*laugh* alrighty then ... if you know me so well, describe in 10 words or less."
Poogad tells you, "Go back and pay careful attention what I said."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Nah, i stopped paying attention after, "I need a hand job"."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "So take your best shot, child."
Poogad tells you, "I don&#39;t have to know you on a personal level to know what you may or may not be thinking, doing, or going to think or do."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "That&#39;s creepy, and completely out of whack, and yes you do ..."
Poogad tells you, "Keep saying that. The security the belief gives you is only as secure as the foundations of the belief."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "And my belief is that my husband is not dirt or scum, or a pervert like you think he is."
Poogad tells you, "*sigh*."
Poogad tells you, "As I said, having a sexual encounter with someone outside of a specified relationship doesn&#39;t make you any of those things."
Poogad tells you, "Only if you believe you are, or he is, etc."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "A) im not, b) he&#39;s not, c) you are delusional in thinking this."  
Poogad tells you, "Those things are only concepts, not laws of nature, or physical manifestations in themselves."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Why so philisophical on me? and why so curious on my life?"
Poogad tells you, "You aren&#39;t any particular target."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "I don&#39;t believe you."
Poogad tells you, "Just the first girl on qw."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "That&#39;s complete bullshit."
Poogad tells you, "*shrug* There is no point in me arguing further, you have made up your mind. And we all know how women refuse to change their minds, even in the fact of scientific fact."
Poogad tells you, "Face of scientific fact."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "I don&#39;t know what makes you think im this type of girl...YOU ARE A GIRL! shit, that aint me!"
Poogad tells you, "Yes I am a girl, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to deny my true nature."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "To be a guy?"
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "And take a married woman?"
Poogad tells you, "..."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "You are sick."
Poogad tells you, "Why would I want to be a guy?"
Poogad tells you, "I&#39;m not trying to take anything from anyone, but maybe give to everyone."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Ew."
Poogad tells you, "I am a woman, a woman who embraces her sexuality and refuses to be poisoned by the illogical rationale of human emotions."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "You really need a new hobby."
Poogad tells you, "Jealous."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Of what?"
Poogad tells you, "Everything I am and everything you are not."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "And that would be?"
Poogad tells you, "My big penis."
Poogad tells you, "That is attached to your husband."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "WTF!?"
Poogad tells you, "*hums innocently*."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "....."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Okay, you are scaring me, and starting to piss me off..."
Poogad tells you, "The truth is out there."
Poogad tells you, "You just have to find it."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "You don&#39;t know me, nor my husband ... ((you obviously know me ooc))"
Poogad tells you, "Tralalalala."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Okay who are you."
Poogad tells you, "Santa."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Erm no."
Poogad tells you, "Now why would I expose myself?"
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Cuz obviously you want me to guess."
Poogad tells you, "Keep guessing, I will tell you when you are right."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Someone who wants me, but can&#39;t have me, cuz I have no desire to be with a pervert or a liar."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "You obviously know me now or in a past life." 
Poogad tells you, "*beep beep* wrong!"
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Yeah okay."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Seriously, who are you?"
Poogad tells you, "I will never tell."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Doubt that, you have an alt."
Poogad tells you, "Nope."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Liar."
Poogad tells you, "Nope."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Yes."
Poogad tells you, "My one and only here."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Nope."
Poogad tells you, "Yep."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "You are a terrible liar."
Poogad tells you, "You are right, because I never lie."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Yes you do."
Poogad tells you, "There is no use arguing."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "((im like 30 seconds close in issuing you, if you don&#39;t tell me who you are))"
Poogad tells you, "Your father."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Erm ... no."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "What do you want?"
Poogad tells you, "Now I will kill myself and you will never know."
Poogad tells you, "A handjob."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "You&#39;re a girl, not a boy."
Poogad tells you, "Girls can get handjobs..."
Poogad tells you, "Omg... you have never even masturbated! YOu are a virgin!!" 
Poogad tells you, "You aren&#39;t aware women can get pleasure from hands."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "You can do that yourself :P."
Poogad tells you, "Its not the same."'>Poogad tells you, "Hi."
You tell Poogad, Child of the Divine, "Hello."

No, you&rsquo;re too cool to follow the law. You&rsquo;re one of those trendy hipster dipshits who pretends the rules don&rsquo;t apply to him. Yeah, keep thinking that.
