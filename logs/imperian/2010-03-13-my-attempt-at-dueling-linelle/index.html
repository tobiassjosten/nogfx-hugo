If you want to be fancy you can track the last salve you applied and use that to determine what isn&rsquo;t working. Alternatively, you can simply trigger it to #SAY or #ECHO &ldquo;Diagnose now, noob!&rdquo; onto your screen.</p><p>As others have pointed out, your combat strategy wasn&rsquo;t too bad and it was always going to be an uphill battle for you against someone with beastbane. With that said, better implementation of Revelation tracking and Yoth would have given you a slightly better chance at building some offensive momentum and slowing down Linelle&rsquo;s offense.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcd10b15095f431c24ced7dcfd20ee1b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by metrowolf12@xxx on 14Â Mar 2010</p><blockquote><p>amazon
