The butterfly monarch proudly flies in from the east.

The butterfly monarch wraps its giant wings around Kailynn, as though creating around her a dress.

"Ooohhhhhhhhhh," you say.

You giggle happily.

This butterfly is massive, its body easily the size of an adult Sidhe male. The blackish-green body looks like a series of armour plates laid one over the other, marked only by a long, curling  proboscis and two eyes that seem like polished amethysts and topped by two quivering antennae. Six armored-looking legs are held in tightly to the butterfly&#39;s sides. The large body is supported by immense wings, the movement of which stirs the air in great gusts. The wings are covered in a strange pattern of swirls and whorls in a variety of oranges and blues and greens, the patterns outlined in black and strangely mesmerizing.
The butterfly monarch is quite powerful.
It weighs about 20 pounds.
You see nothing in it.

You give the butterfly monarch a compassionate hug.

You say to the butterfly monarch, "Perfect!"

The butterfly monarch flutters, as though unused to such things as hugs.

You say to the butterfly monarch, "You know... I was the Butterfly Princess for a long time... I am rather fond of your kind."

The butterfly monarch flutters up and down, staring at Kailynn.

You poke at a pink, butterfly adorned mace.

You poke at a golden butterfly armlet.

You poke at a delicate pink butterfly necklace.

You say to the butterfly monarch, "And I still love wearing them on me."

The butterfly monarch flicks his probiscus out at Kailynn, slipping it into the center of her bun as though into the center of a flower.

You giggle happily at the butterfly monarch.

The butterfly monarch looks frustrated when no nectar flows from Kailynn&#39;s hair!

You say to the butterfly monarch, "Silly butterfly, I may be sweet, and just as pretty as a flower  But, I am sadly not one."

The butterfly monarch slowly opens and closes his wings.

You say to the butterfly monarch, "But you can be my best friend!"

You feel your mind stunned by the patterns on the wings, as though you cannot think.  You are slightly dizzy, entranced, enchanted, by the movement of -this- butterfly.

You say to the butterfly monarch, "One powerful butterfly...."

You say to the butterfly monarch, "Just my kind of friend."

The butterfly monarch flutters its wings quickly, skirting around Kailynn and up into the air.

You feel the trance broken, suddenly, but you have a brush upon your mind that feels almost a  warning that this is not just your regular butterfly.

Wait!" you cry out at the butterfly monarch desperately.

You say to the butterfly monarch, "Don&#39;t go!"

You sniffle softly.

You say to the butterfly monarch, "No one is going to believe when I tell them that ...this amazing butterfly...made himself into a dress for me!"

The butterfly monarch the butterfly pauses, fluttering its wings, creating a gentle breeze, and then departs.

The butterfly monarch glides elegantly to the southwest.
