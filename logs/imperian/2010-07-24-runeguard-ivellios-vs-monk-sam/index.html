A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The once grand market 
square of ancient Caanae surrounds this centralized point, where the ground has been shaken and torn
apart by a catastrophic event. Three meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic scripts lie 
collapsed upon the ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean askew to one side of the stone 
pile, blocking the view from outside of all the wonders housed within this temple. Barely standing 
under the weight of a pillar is a marble altar, which has been etched with scars and scratches from 
the passage of time and elements. The structure of the pillars silently displays how it was once a 
small but impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar indicate it to have been built in honor
of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the cracks in the centre is a passage of pure water, perhaps the 
purest known in the realm of Aetherius. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins 
in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon 
the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, 
depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A painted metal sculpture resembling a 
man with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. A small sign points into a market stall. A 
shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light 
grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A 
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the 
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells
moving in the wind. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its
white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and striking monument. An intricately carved 
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning 
statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. Hovering in the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected 
in its wings. A regal white songbird with indigo tipped feathers sits on his perch, head tilted 
proudly. Reison is lying on the ground. Journeyman Praetoris is here. He wields a set of polished 
panpipes in his left hand and a small oaken drum in his right. Dax, Student of the Arts is here. 
Lady Ariette, the Arcane Melody is here. She is holding a small oaken drum in her left hand. 
Songstress Valiea Iyavere, the Amethyst Rhapsody is here. She wields a beechwood mandolin in her 
left hand and a tower shield in her right. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Sam, 
Aspect of Aryana. He wields a Deathwind sitara in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.<371/371h 436/467m 1685e 2236w 37x <ebpp> <b>>

A jera rune has worn off your body.

A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The once grand market
square of ancient Caanae surrounds this centralized point, where the ground has been shaken and torn
apart by a catastrophic event. Three meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic scripts lie
collapsed upon the ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean askew to one side of the stone
pile, blocking the view from outside of all the wonders housed within this temple. Barely standing
under the weight of a pillar is a marble altar, which has been etched with scars and scratches from
the passage of time and elements. The structure of the pillars silently displays how it was once a
small but impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar indicate it to have been built in honor
of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the cracks in the centre is a passage of pure water, perhaps the
purest known in the realm of Aetherius. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins
in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon
the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here,
depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A painted metal sculpture resembling a
man with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. A small sign points into a market stall. A
shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light
grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells
moving in the wind. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its
white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and striking monument. An intricately carved
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning
statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his
gaze cast over the Springs. Hovering in the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected
in its wings. A regal white songbird with indigo tipped feathers sits on his perch, head tilted
proudly. Reison is lying on the ground. Journeyman Praetoris is here. He wields a set of polished
panpipes in his left hand and a small oaken drum in his right. Dax, Student of the Arts is here.
Lady Ariette, the Arcane Melody is here. She is holding a small oaken drum in her left hand.
Songstress Valiea Iyavere, the Amethyst Rhapsody is here. She wields a beechwood mandolin in her
left hand and a tower shield in her right. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Sam,

You tumble out of the room.
The empty southern square.A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. This corner of the
abandoned market is covered with a dim shadow from the overhanging boulders that create a cliff
formation from the pillars on which they are stacked. An old arrowhead peeks out from underneath the
bottom of the pile, though the remains of the owner of that weapon are no where in sight. If one
stands in this dismal section of the square long enough, a cold breeze can be felt dancing over your
flesh. A brawny man is here, hefting large pieces of leather over his shoulder and scolding his
mule.
You see exits leading north, northeast, southeast, and northwest.
You drop back and ease the engagement.
You are separated from Dax and can no longer defend him.
