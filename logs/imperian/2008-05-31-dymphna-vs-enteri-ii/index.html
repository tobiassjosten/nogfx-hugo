Over-grown, tangled garden. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. What once may have 
been a lovingly tended garden has been laid waste by the ravages of time. A 
small fountain in the center no longer flows, instead overgrown with weeds and 
vines which thickly coat everything. Oddly though, there is a wild kind of

perhaps a little of the love and care remains, enabling these flowers to

brooding vulture snaps at anything in reach. A thorny lizard is here, hissing

Over-grown, tangled garden. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. What once may have
been a lovingly tended garden has been laid waste by the ravages of time. A
small fountain in the center no longer flows, instead overgrown with weeds and
vines which thickly coat everything. Oddly though, there is a wild kind of
beauty here, as many of the vines put forth deeply coloured blooms and fill the
air with their soft scent. Whilst the hand that tended this place is long gone,
perhaps a little of the love and care remains, enabling these flowers to
flourish even now. You have entered the campground of Enteri. A dervish,
whirling about faster than the eye can see, is here. There are 3 charcoal
cinders in 3 groups here. Floating above you is a strange cloud in which can be
seen the swirling images of tortured faces and flailing claws. The shining
figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Hunched over himself a
brooding vulture snaps at anything in reach. A thorny lizard is here, hissing
menacingly and moving slowly around the room. Fluttering on delicate wings, a
huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A sharp-clawed caracal prowls
about here. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously
with beady black eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for
enemies. There are 4 maidenhair leaves in 4 groups here. A cloud of smoke fills
the area, coming from a campfire in the center of a campground. Seraphic Pride,
Ebonas yn'Chionnal is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand. Anthe
Ashtear-Vuh'uni, Grain in the Wind is here, hidden.

Over-grown, tangled garden. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. What once may have
been a lovingly tended garden has been laid waste by the ravages of time. A
small fountain in the center no longer flows, instead overgrown with weeds and
vines which thickly coat everything. Oddly though, there is a wild kind of
beauty here, as many of the vines put forth deeply coloured blooms and fill the
air with their soft scent. Whilst the hand that tended this place is long gone,
perhaps a little of the love and care remains, enabling these flowers to
flourish even now. You have entered the campground of Enteri. A dervish,
whirling about faster than the eye can see, is here. There are 3 charcoal
cinders in 3 groups here. Floating above you is a strange cloud in which can be
seen the swirling images of tortured faces and flailing claws. The shining
figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Hunched over himself a
brooding vulture snaps at anything in reach. A thorny lizard is here, hissing
menacingly and moving slowly around the room. Fluttering on delicate wings, a
huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A sharp-clawed caracal prowls
about here. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously
with beady black eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for
enemies. There are 4 maidenhair leaves in 4 groups here. A cloud of smoke fills
the area, coming from a campfire in the center of a campground. Anthe
Ashtear-Vuh'uni, Grain in the Wind is here, hidden. Seraphic Pride, Ebonas
yn'Chionnal is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand.
You see exits leading northeast, west, and down.
