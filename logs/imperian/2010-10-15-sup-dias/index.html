Damp sewer tunnels. (Ancient Sewer Ruins.?)
Damp moss grows upon the ancient walls, the floor surprisingly dry for a sewer.
Rubble from partially fallen walls litter the ground, making it sometimes
difficult to traverse the tunnels. An overbearing smell lingers in the air,
making it difficult to breath. Menacing sounds echo eerily through the stale
and stench-filled air, sending goosebumps prickling along the flesh of your
arms. Archmagus of Fire, Sir Dias Tethe'alla, Envoy of Terror is here,
surrounded by a aura of black flames. He wields a Souledge Sabre in his left
hand and a tower shield in his right.
