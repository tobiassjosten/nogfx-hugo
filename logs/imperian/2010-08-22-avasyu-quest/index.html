to face the statue.

Darfinn Mintash, Avasyuvian Scholar slowly lowers himself, with the use of his 
gnarled walking staff, to the ground just before the statue.

He begins to intone low sounds, perhaps the name Avasyu, but you cannot be 
certain.

You say, "Gracious Lord, He who brings the rains that feed the crops. Grateful are we for the bounty of the lands You granted us."

You say, "Know that we honor all that is given, and taste the fruits our 
careful tending has gifted."

You say, "From the graceful boughs, heavily laden each year."

You put a small green apple into the right hand of a statue.

You say, "From the tilled field, worked by our strong backs."

You put a sheaf of grain into the left hand of a statue.

You say, "That dancing waters that give life to our gentle valley."

You put a tiny glass phial into a stone basin.

You say, "For even from ruin grows new life."
 
You put a narrow orange capped mushroom into a stone basin.

You say, "And in the darkest depths, we find the glory of You."

You put a crab shell into a stone basin.

Darfinn Mintash, Avasyuvian Scholar places both hands flat against the base of the statue and begins to utter a low chant in an unfamiliar tongue.
 
The strange words seem to swell up around you, drawing in a chill breeze that sends shivers down your spine as the items on the shrine begins to fade into near transparency.

As they disappear, the statue seems to glow with an inner vibrancy. An 
impression of realism is superimposed over the cold stone; flesh, hair, 
clothing, and eyes standing out in surprisingly clear detail.

The eyes of the statue seem to direct their gaze towards you. In the instant 
they connect, a flash of blinding light fills the room and you find yourself 
falling to your knees.

When your senses return, the statue appears perfectly normal once more. Darfinn rises slowly to his feet, his clear eyes shining with wonder as he glances down and takes hold of an amulet in his hand, holding it reverently for a moment.

Darfinn Mintash, Avasyuvian Scholar says, "Here, take this token. If my 
research is correct, it will grant you the boon of Lord Avasyu for a time."

Darfinn smiles broadly as he tosses you a heavy pouch of gold and says, "Now, shoo before I forget any of this! Thank you kindly for all your help. I hope to see you again soon.
A sense of accomplishment washes over you.

With that he lowers himself once more to the cool stone floor and begins to 
furiously write in a small notebook that seems to materialize in his hands.
