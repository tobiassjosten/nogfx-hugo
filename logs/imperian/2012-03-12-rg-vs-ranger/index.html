Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The spring of crystalline 
water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and 
brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil 
lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of 
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A plain 
metal chest rests upon the ground here. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat 
looms over the surrounding area. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A small sign points into a market stall. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here 
depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A plain metal candlestick rests 
upon the ground here. A massive, sparkling wheel hovers here, a bejeweled arrow pointing straight up
from the middle of the wheel. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched 
atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. This elegantly 
carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its white marble and sapphire form 
creating an impressive and striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite 
sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands 
here, marble foam about its mouth. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his surroundings.
A massive bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands of foam hanging from its muzzle. Tomast 
the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. A cimmerian kestrel paces restlessly here. A
brown and white dog romps around playfully, wagging his tail and searching for bones. Ser Orotu 
Bathory is riding on an august burnished stallion. He wields a mithril sabre in his left hand and a 
cavalry shield in his right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway leads down.

A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The spring of crystalline
water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and
brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil
lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A plain
metal chest rests upon the ground here. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat
looms over the surrounding area. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin
here. A small sign points into a market stall. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here
depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A plain metal candlestick rests
upon the ground here. A massive, sparkling wheel hovers here, a bejeweled arrow pointing straight up
from the middle of the wheel. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched
atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. This elegantly
carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its white marble and sapphire form
creating an impressive and striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite
sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands
here, marble foam about its mouth. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his surroundings.
A massive bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands of foam hanging from its muzzle. Tomast
the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. A cimmerian kestrel paces restlessly here. A
brown and white dog romps around playfully, wagging his tail and searching for bones. Ser Orotu

cavalry shield in his right.
