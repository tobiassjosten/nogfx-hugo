Your current clan will now be the \&#39;Council of Kinsarmar\&#39; clan.
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Why do you need this medium?\"
(Kc): You say, \"Who and why?\"
Kc): Arakis says, \"She\&#39;s not on the CTP yet and I\&#39;d prefer it not presented to the entire city because we don\&#39;t need every last person throwing in their two bits just let.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Yet*.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"And it\&#39;s Risu.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Oh, is this about the spirits?\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"I believe so aye.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"They\&#39;re keeping Paili from me.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Who is?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"The spirits.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Ah.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Katarsh, Alvetta, any objection?\"
(Coalition): Alvetta says, \"No.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"She believes that as we move further into the gate, we increase the attacks.\"
(Kc): You say, \"Who is Paili, and what spirits are we talking about?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"And if we awaken the stronghold, we\&#39;ll unleash evil.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"The spirits who created the gate.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Risu you are only to be here temporarily but I\&#39;d like you to present your theory to the Council.\"
You tell Lady Caelya Kaeul, Arcane Administrator, \"What gate?\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Ah, alright, of course.\"
Caelya tells you, \"The one in Demon\&#39;s Pass.\"
You tell Lady Caelya Kaeul, Arcane Administrator, \"Ah.\"
You tell Lady Caelya Kaeul, Arcane Administrator, \"I wasn\&#39;t aware anything had progressed with the demons thing... guess that\&#39;s what I get for being absent.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"As I was tell Caelya and Arakis earlier, I think the further we get into the fortress, the further we open the rift. As we keep getting further into the fortress, the attacks on the townes have gotten progressively worse and worse. Kinsarmarians and the people we\&#39;re sworn to protect are dying left and right to demons. They\&#39;re getting more fierce, coming in stronger numbers, and much more swiftly than before. The spirits at the fortress are warning us for a reason. And we are only attacking the fortress, as far as I\&#39;m aware, on the whim of an undead girl and the thought that if we claim it that the rift will close, which has been the opposite effect so far.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"As I was telling, rather.\"
(Coalition): Caelya says, \"Or the spirits are the seven demons trying to keep Paili from me.\"
(Coalition): Caelya says, \"This was a miss.\"
(Coalition): Caelya says, \"Brought to you by Caelya.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Or the spirits are the seven demons trying to keep Paili from me.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Caelya, listen to yourself. Paili is an undead. She is neither magick or living at this point. We need to ensure that WE are safe, that our townes are safe, that the city is safe.\"
(Kc): You say, \"Caelya is pointing out an alternate theory. No need for attacking.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"I\&#39;m sorry, I didn\&#39;t mean to be hostile.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"She\&#39;s promised me an army. What better way to defend ourselves than with an army?\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"And how do we know she\&#39;s not decieving you?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"My daughter would never do such a thing. She loves me.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"But what kind of army will the rift that is currently spewing forth demons that kill our citizens, attack our villages and slaughter their inhabitants?\"
You tell Sir Arakis Chytovil-Dra\&#39;Nyk, Iron Wolf, \"((OOC) And off-topic. What is Caelya talking about with her daughter? \&#39;cuz I\&#39;m creeped out now, just sayin\&#39;)\"
Arakis tells you, \"//the spirit calls her mother.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Any army that the rift will bring forth will kill whomever stands in its way. It won\&#39;t be an army of magick. It\&#39;d be an army of demons.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Caelya.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"How is this actually your child? Deceit can use any names and titles, what do you actually have proving she\&#39;s true?\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Your spirit called Melina mother too as I recall.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"I wanted it badly enough and it happened, and you can\&#39;t take it away from me.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"That\&#39;s rather irrational Caelya.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Caelya, we need to think of this on the side of the city, of the magick community.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Saying it\&#39;s your child doesn\&#39;t make it so, and you\&#39;ve removed your status as unbiased.\"
(Kc): You say, \"Children do not simply appear out of thin air. I do believe we\&#39;re all adult enough to recognize this.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"What does Alvetta and Mercer and Penelope think?\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Regardless if she truly is her child, Paili is undead. She cannot be trusted in that form. That\&#39;s accepting logic from a creature spawned from outside of magick and delving into necromancy itself. If Paili is still there.. I do not know. But I don\&#39;t know if we should trust an undead\&#39;s promise of an army.\"
(Kc): You say, \"I do not know enough about these spirits or this fortress to speak anything further. But this talk of a child concerns me.\"
-----------------------------------  (Here I entered NEWS to write a post, and relied on CLTELLS to catch me up by two statements)
You recall that (2012/09/26 05:28) Arakis said:
\"Rishi was involved in all of this as I recall.\"
H:[447/424] M:[241/241] E:2136 W:1105 <eb db> XP: 49.89% 
You recall that (2012/09/26 05:28) Risu said:
\"Caelya, I have faith that you care about Kinsarmar, please don\&#39;t misunderstand. I\&#39;ve seen you work to help Her people and Her cause.\"
----------------------------------- 
(Kc): Caelya says, \"She told me to open the gate, Rishi told me to desire it and it would be. And so it was.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"If it was a mistake, then it was my mistake.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"If this widening rift is bringing death upon us all, then it is death caused by me.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"Cealya? What is it is a mistake.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"If.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Words of an undead, and the keeper of a demonic fortress.\"
(Kc): Mercer says, \"My role in this has been rather brutish, I\&#39;ve been asked to hit things and I have. The whole demons and rift and stronghold and all of this...I don\&#39;t honestly understand a whole lot of it. I\&#39;ll just hit whatever undead, demon, or horde I\&#39;ll hit them. But from what we\&#39;ve encountered in the desert temple with the undead...I\&#39;d rather stay away from as much as possible.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"It\&#39;s very possible that they have their own agenda.\"
Doshar tells you, \"Enthralled in this demonic discussion which I am apparently not privvy to?\"
You tell Lord Doshar Elith, \"Yar. I was supposed to be resting by now. Great fun. ((OOC) I\&#39;m going to be so exhaused in the morning)\"
You tell Lord Doshar Elith, \"((OOC) Second daughter was born yesterday. Wasn\&#39;t supposed to be working today, but I was. Got called in for the rest of the week. And I still have a 9-page research paper unfinished that was due yesterday. And I live and sleep in my car, heh.)\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Other than the promise of an army we may not be able to control, that may be demonic in nature, the troops that may be attacking our townes and the Duchy itself.. what have we to gain from assaulting the fortress further than risk opening the rift even further than it is?\"
(Kc): You say, \"What is in this fortress, might I ask?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Demons. Seven. We kill them, we awaken the fortress.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Demons, as far as I\&#39;m aware. Guardians of the fortress itself, it seems.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"But why Caelya?\"
(Kc): You say, \"A house divided against itself cannot stand. Logically, it makes little sense for the rift to be positively affected by the killing of demons.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"But look at the attacks on the townes. They\&#39;ve grown much more severe, much more common, since we\&#39;ve killed the demons in the fortress.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"You\&#39;re certain that isn\&#39;t the demonic armies putting more pressure on us now that we\&#39;re drawing closer to our goal?\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"The problem is we cannot be certain either way.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"If widening the rift worked in their favour, and we are doing it for them - why attack our townes?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"One would think the attacks would decrease, to allow us to do their bidding.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"That is a good point.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Demons do not neccessarily ally themselve with undead.\"
(Kc): You say, \"Not necessarily. The demons already want to destroy us.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"The child is undead how do we know the army promised isn\&#39;t one of the undead? we could not ally ourselves with such.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"As I\&#39;ve said, they can very well have their own agenda. They don\&#39;t side with anybody. They could have goals beyond our comprehension.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Also take note that the Horde attacks have also been increasing upon Celidon. What rift have -they- opened?\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"My point exactly, Arakis.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Magick is a singular faction wether we like each other or no, what happens to one will affect the other.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"As I was told, her body is undead, but it is her spirit that speaks to me.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"How can we be assured of that, Caelya?\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"And as was stated before how do youo know the spirit is not corrupted?\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"You insist the child is yours Caelya, yet you did not bear her, how can we be sure the soul wasn\&#39;t foul? You fiercely protect this child yet we know nothing concrete of her other than she promises you an army?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"She is a gift.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"From?\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"You have to admit, it sounds incredibly shady. We can\&#39;t fathom what this army could be. Demons, undead, monstrosities..\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"A gift from who.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Someone who feels I deserve her.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"That\&#39;s no answer Caelya, and it does not sound like you.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Caelya you\&#39;re worrying me.\"
(Kc): You say, \"And me as well.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"Me too.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"But from who, Caelya? We need reason. Blind faith alone cannot let us make choices for the city.\"
(Kc): Mercer says, \"I\&#39;ll jump on that bandwagon too..\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"An undead child is not a child, it is an undead.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"She is trapped.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"And we all know how we deal with the undead.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Trapped? But how? We don\&#39;t know anything about her, other than she promises you an army for opening a rift that could potentially end all life in Aetherius. Caelya, she cannot be trusted.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"My suggestion is this. We should ignore the fortress and bar entry from it. See what happens within a few months of it standing idle, prevent others from going in and trying to slay the guardians that stand watch. Help aide our sister council Celidon with defense against the Horde and see if the demons begin to lose numbers and stop attacking the townes so frequently. A few months worth of this should show a pattern of some degree.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Either way, the Horde is held at bay and we can see if these attacks on the fortress are truly bringing more demons into the realms.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"How do you propose we bar entry and who would gage the Horde activity?\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"The coalition could be brought to such matters, I do believe.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"We could coordinate defenses through the clan, and leaders can help bring to attention when attacks are happening. As for the fortress, I\&#39;m unaware who is leading the assaults. Whoever it is, though, needs to be told to stop immediately for sake of safety. We cannot blindly rush in there on a whim of an undead.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"We need to ensure the safety of Kinsarmar and Celidon and the townes of each. That should be our top priority, regardless of the actions we take against the fortress.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"I must say I\&#39;m inclined to support Risu\&#39;s idea, but I\&#39;d like all of your thoughts.\"
(Kc): Mercer says, \"Whatever is best for Kinsarmar and Magick, that\&#39;s my take.\"
(Kc): You say, \"I do not like leaving a demonick fortress unchallenged. But I also do not like rushing into something not knowing whose cause we are fighting for.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"I think Risu\&#39;s idea is a fair one.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"I do believe I can call others to aide that as well. Although, I do want to know more about this Horde business. Since when have they been bugging Celidon?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"As long as the demons have been bothering us.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Undead have been after Stavenn.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"And Antioch.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Then I think we should definitely help Celidon with their efforts to push the Horde back. In return, they could help us push the demons back as we watch their numbers and the frequency of attacks.\"'>(Kc): Arakis says, \"I\'d like to temporarily add someone here to present a theory.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Any objection?\"
Your current clan will now be the \'Council of Kinsarmar\' clan.
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Why do you need this medium?\"
(Kc): You say, \"Who and why?\"
Kc): Arakis says, \"She\'s not on the CTP yet and I\'d prefer it not presented to the entire city because we don\'t need every last person throwing in their two bits just let.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Yet*.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"And it\'s Risu.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Oh, is this about the spirits?\"

(Kc): Arakis says, \"The child is undead how do we know the army promised isn\'t one of the undead? we could not ally ourselves with such.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"As I\'ve said, they can very well have their own agenda. They don\'t side with anybody. They could have goals beyond our comprehension.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Also take note that the Horde attacks have also been increasing upon Celidon. What rift have -they- opened?\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"My point exactly, Arakis.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Magick is a singular faction wether we like each other or no, what happens to one will affect the other.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"As I was told, her body is undead, but it is her spirit that speaks to me.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"How can we be assured of that, Caelya?\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"And as was stated before how do youo know the spirit is not corrupted?\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"You insist the child is yours Caelya, yet you did not bear her, how can we be sure the soul wasn\'t foul? You fiercely protect this child yet we know nothing concrete of her other than she promises you an army?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"She is a gift.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"From?\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"You have to admit, it sounds incredibly shady. We can\'t fathom what this army could be. Demons, undead, monstrosities..\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"A gift from who.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Someone who feels I deserve her.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"That\'s no answer Caelya, and it does not sound like you.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"Caelya you\'re worrying me.\"
(Kc): You say, \"And me as well.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"Me too.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"But from who, Caelya? We need reason. Blind faith alone cannot let us make choices for the city.\"
(Kc): Mercer says, \"I\'ll jump on that bandwagon too..\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"An undead child is not a child, it is an undead.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"She is trapped.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"And we all know how we deal with the undead.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Trapped? But how? We don\'t know anything about her, other than she promises you an army for opening a rift that could potentially end all life in Aetherius. Caelya, she cannot be trusted.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"My suggestion is this. We should ignore the fortress and bar entry from it. See what happens within a few months of it standing idle, prevent others from going in and trying to slay the guardians that stand watch. Help aide our sister council Celidon with defense against the Horde and see if the demons begin to lose numbers and stop attacking the townes so frequently. A few months worth of this should show a pattern of some degree.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Either way, the Horde is held at bay and we can see if these attacks on the fortress are truly bringing more demons into the realms.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"How do you propose we bar entry and who would gage the Horde activity?\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"The coalition could be brought to such matters, I do believe.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"We could coordinate defenses through the clan, and leaders can help bring to attention when attacks are happening. As for the fortress, I\'m unaware who is leading the assaults. Whoever it is, though, needs to be told to stop immediately for sake of safety. We cannot blindly rush in there on a whim of an undead.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"We need to ensure the safety of Kinsarmar and Celidon and the townes of each. That should be our top priority, regardless of the actions we take against the fortress.\"
(Kc): Arakis says, \"I must say I\'m inclined to support Risu\'s idea, but I\'d like all of your thoughts.\"
(Kc): Mercer says, \"Whatever is best for Kinsarmar and Magick, that\'s my take.\"
(Kc): You say, \"I do not like leaving a demonick fortress unchallenged. But I also do not like rushing into something not knowing whose cause we are fighting for.\"
(Kc): Alvetta says, \"I think Risu\'s idea is a fair one.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"I do believe I can call others to aide that as well. Although, I do want to know more about this Horde business. Since when have they been bugging Celidon?\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"As long as the demons have been bothering us.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"Undead have been after Stavenn.\"
(Kc): Caelya says, \"And Antioch.\"
(Kc): Risu says, \"Then I think we should definitely help Celidon with their efforts to push the Horde back. In return, they could help us push the demons back as we watch their numbers and the frequency of attacks.\"</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
