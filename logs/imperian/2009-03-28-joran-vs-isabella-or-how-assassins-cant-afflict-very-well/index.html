Above statement: You don&rsquo;t do stupid dstabs combos when your opponent is eating orphine and applying epidermal or using focus ON your illusions. Then you USE that situation to stack up with something else.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8cfb2ccd2c6065532287994d05a8d7b2?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dragontheme_tim@xxx on 01 Apr 2009</p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s just her being bad.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a886160f6368d600ed79cfef78c1cb9d?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by pimpim_85@xxx on 01 Apr 2009</p>Which was my point to begin with, and therefor is the &ldquo;fact&rdquo;:that they can&rsquo;t afflict very good, not really justified.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8cfb2ccd2c6065532287994d05a8d7b2?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dragontheme_tim@xxx on 03 Apr 2009</p><blockquote><p>.> It read like you said &lsquo;Even though they can&rsquo;t afflict that good, she doesn&rsquo;t abuse <insert overpowered winbutton>&rsquo;. And if you&rsquo;re going for a lock on someone with fitness you&rsquo;re being pretty pretty bad. Better to just try and stack as much affs as possible, flay mass etc, pull it through 25 formaldehyde darts and sic a cobra on it, and try to keep xeroderma on your target for 30 seconds. Granted, you&rsquo;ll need a lot of luck but it&rsquo;s more realistic than trying to lock.</p></blockquote></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
