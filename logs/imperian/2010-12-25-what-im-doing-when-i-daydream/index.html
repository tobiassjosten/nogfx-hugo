I lived on a Marine Base and knew some of the nastiest, foulest military men on earth to at least be able to treat women with some modicum of respect. You call yourself by all kinds of military titles and I call &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; because from everything I have ever seen of you you neither keep to any kind of military kind of trainking regarding the respect of others, you lack self-control, and you spend way too much time playing online for someone who is active duty.

I was ashamed for quite some time, because it IS embarrassing to not have control over my body; but it&rsquo;s an illness, like the flu, like cancer. Yes, like cancer. My case is progressive. I&rsquo;d rather not talk about that here. So make fun of it, I can&rsquo;t really stop you, just like I can&rsquo;t wish myself better. You can accuse me of making it up all you like and I wish to Gods it was all pretend so that I could wake up one day and be better. I won&rsquo;t respond to any more of your barbs, comments or jibes. You can say what you like here and elsewhere, but I&rsquo;m done. I don&rsquo;t have the time or energy for some little kid like you. When I first met you I offered you the same thing I offer anyone - a bit of kindness, an open mind; and you took it and offered hurt and cruelty; much like the characters we play in our game. Except I&rsquo;m not immortal here, and I really am sick, and just don&rsquo;t feel like dealing with whatever darkness you let grow inside of you. I just don&rsquo;t have it in me.
