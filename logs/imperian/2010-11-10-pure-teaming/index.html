Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. A large grouping of orange trees surround you, their branches extending
out in all directions. The overall form of the trees is very circular, with the
narrow branches and light coloured leaves appearing to be elegantly trimmed. 
Fresh oranges have begun to grow on the branches of the tree, their forms 
appearing to be plump and juicy. Two extra large oranges lay on the ground 
below the tree, having grown too heavy for the tender branches. Gore is 
splattered about, a display of Dias's cruel handiwork. Small oranges hang down 
from the branches of this fragile looking sapling. A noble kestrel is perched 
nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you. General Dias Tethe'alla, Archmagus of Fire 
is here, surrounded by a aura of black flames. He wields a stone totem in his 
hands.

You have slain Dias.">Near a cluster of orange trees. (Urr Grove.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. A large grouping of orange trees surround you, their branches extending
out in all directions. The overall form of the trees is very circular, with the
narrow branches and light coloured leaves appearing to be elegantly trimmed.
Fresh oranges have begun to grow on the branches of the tree, their forms
appearing to be plump and juicy. Two extra large oranges lay on the ground
below the tree, having grown too heavy for the tender branches. Gore is
splattered about, a display of Dias's cruel handiwork. Small oranges hang down
from the branches of this fragile looking sapling. A noble kestrel is perched
nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you. General Dias Tethe'alla, Archmagus of Fire
is here, surrounded by a aura of black flames. He wields a stone totem in his
hands.
