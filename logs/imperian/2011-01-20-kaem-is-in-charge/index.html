Spending ages probing for an opening in a ridiculous defense while having to keep up a litany of rote tasks to avoid getting clipped by 49% absolves is tiresome, and 90% of the time the cleric just runs if you manage to create an opening where &lsquo;spam prone shield 2 win&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t work. Similarly, your class was only half the excuse - the other half was the overbearing artifact advantage on an already nigh-invincible class. If you expect 1v1 with that from people with less investment, you&rsquo;re sadly mistaken on so very many levels.</p><p>Also, as previously mentioned, Antiochans crying about teaming is the most delicious irony ever.
