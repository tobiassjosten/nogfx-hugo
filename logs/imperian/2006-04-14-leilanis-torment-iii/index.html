Imperial Parade nearing the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Bearing
the Imperial seal of Stavenn, a black marble bench is here. A sigil in the
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A kohdon scout stands
here eyeing his surroundings with an impassionated stare. A menacing mahogany
chair sprouts from the floor here like a leafless barren tree. A short-legged
and chunky hound sniffs at the air here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a cannon
here. He has forty cannon balls.
You see exits leading east, west (open door), and northwest.

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

You glare angrily at Sethren.

Sethren whispers to you, "Good girl."

Sethren smiles pleasantly at you, his tail swinging slowly behind him.

You whisper to Sethren, "I did not feel like being slapped around again, it
does not mean I am seeking your company for my own pleasure."

You growl menacingly.

Sethren beckons you to him.

You begin to follow Sethren.

Sethren Argyle says, "I&#39;m sure."

Sethren smirks.

You follow Sethren to the northwest.

-wandering-

A dim study in the Academy. (City of Stavenn.)
The back room of the Academy is shaped like a half-circle. The ceiling is flat,
and where the wall meets has marbleized molding of battles. Six columns
protrude from the wall, each crafted in the shape of an ominous, hooded figure.
Silver braziers take up the spaces between all of the columns, illuminating the
dark chamber with their golden light. The floor underfoot is the same crimson
marble with golden and white veins as decorates the entrance, and is also as
well-polished. A small bookcase rests against the flat wall near the door. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A carved stone bowl rests here,
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. An elegantly crafted
desk of charred redwood rests in a corner. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A partially-burnt letter has been left
here carelessly.
You see exits leading southeast and southwest.

Sethren takes a seat on an elegant desk.

Sethren Argyle says, "Somewhat surprised that you did come, though."

Leilani leans against the bookcase, her hands folded neatly in
front of her back, glaring miserably at you.

Sethren Argyle says, "You&#39;ve been so stubborn up to this point."

Sethren creases his brow in a frown.

You say, "I am stubborn, but I am not stupid. You can find me, do not think I
have accepted your supposed ownership of me. I simply have no wish to be
injured. Eventually I will find the way to remove your disturbing presence from
my life."

"Mhmm," Sethren murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

Sethren Argyle says, "Sure you will."

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "So..you won&#39;t give up yet, hm? I won&#39;t even bother
asking."

Sethren Argyle says, "I will change that soon enough."

Leilani grumbles under her breath, her fingertips brushing the
newly bared skin at her neck without thinking as she stares hard at the
ceiling.

Sethren Argyle stands up slowly, moving closer and taking hold of the pendant
around your neck. "Hm..from the Wytchen, isn&#39;t it?"

Leilani presses back hard against the bookcase, shrinking away
from your touch, "...yes, why?" she whispers in a suspicious tone.

Sethren Argyle swishes his tail slowly back and forth, "Are you still a
Wytch?"

You ponder the situation.

Sethren Argyle says, "I simply wish to know more about you, nothing to worry
about."

You say, "I am still a wytch, I am no longer a member of the pathetic guild who
claims that name."

Sethren nods his head.

Sethren Argyle says, "I&#39;ve heard quite a few speak of the guild in that way."

You frown and say, "With good reason, I am sure."

Sethren Argyle says, "But..hm..something I was going to do either way."

Sethren Argyle says, "Take off the pendant."

You say, "...no."

You say, "Why?"

You peer at Sethren unscrupulously.

Sethren Argyle says, "Give it to me."

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "Or I&#39;ll just take it."

You say, "I do not wish to. It is a symbol of who I am. Why do you need it?"

You growl menacingly.

Sethren Argyle says, "Because you have no need of such symbols."

Sethren Argyle says, "You are mine. That is all you are."

You narrow your eyes to thin slits.

You say, "I will not give it to you, it belongs to me."

Sethren Argyle grins slightly, "I was hoping you would say that.." Without
warning he takes hold of the pendant again, yanking it from your neck and
breaking the chain.

Leilani gasps, clutching desperately where the pendant hangs,
too late to save it from your grasping fingers. She blinks rapidly, holding
back her tears stubbornly. She glares up at you, reaching up a hand to slap you
hard across the face.

You exclaim, "You are nothing but a bully. I do not belong to you, stop
treating me this way!"

Sethren Argyle blinks as the slap catches him off guard and makes contact. He
smirks, responding by shoving you against the wall hard, his weight keeping you
pressed up against it. "I love getting those sort of reactions out of
you..though I&#39;m surprised you thought to do that."

Leilani shakes with rage, a satisfied glint reaching her eyes
as her hand makes contact against your face. She winces as she feels the
bookshelf slamming against her already sore body, causing her to draw in a
sharp breath. She growls angrily at your words, her entire form trembling
visibly as she tries to push out from beneath you.

Sethren Argyle only presses you harder into the bookcase at your reaction,
tilting his head curiously at you. "And what do you think you&#39;d accomplish if
you got away from me?" His tail wraps slowly around you, further keeping you
still.

Leilani growls angrily, "I&#39;d at least get your filthy hands
off me. Give back the pendant, it belongs to me."

Sethren whispers to you, "Sorry, little one. But it&#39;s mine now. And if you say
something like that to me again..well, you&#39;ll regret it. Trust me."

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

You grumble angrily.

Sethren Argyle lets go of you, drawing back a bit and returning to his position
on the desk.

Sethren takes a seat on an elegant desk.

Sethren Argyle says, "I really don&#39;t think you need that pendant anyway."

Leilani slumps down a bit, a look of sheer frustration on her
face as she rubs her sore back. Your words cause her to look up in alarm,
peering suspiciously at you, "Why wouldn&#39;t I?" she asks.

Sethren Argyle says, "Because it exists simply as a reminder of your old life.
It might bring you thoughts of..escape. And those are likely bad things for
you."

Sethren Argyle says, "Perhaps when I have finally made you realize that you are
mine and that will not change, I&#39;ll give you back the pendant and collar
as..keepsakes."

You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.

You say, "I think I would prefer your... company to that of my old guild."

Sethren smirks.

You angrily say, "But that does not mean I do not wish the pendant back."

Sethren Argyle says, "So it didn&#39;t really mean that much to you?"

You say, "It belongs to me."

You say, "You do not have the right to take what is mine."

Sethren Argyle says, "And you belong to me. So it follows that..it belongs to
me as well."

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say, "I do not belong to you. I simply have not found my method of escape
yet."

You grumble angrily.

Sethren Argyle says, "I&#39;m waiting for this escape attempt of yours. Somewhat
looking forward to making you bleed a bit."

Sethren licks a needle-pointed dirk.

Leilani pales visibly, and she tries to mask it with a wry
grin. "That would require you catching me first. I told you the attempt will be
made when I am sure of its success."

Sethren Argyle stretches languidly, seeming entirely unconcerned. "Oh..I&#39;m
sure."

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "I&#39;ll be ever so hard pressed to take you back.."

Sethren smirks.

You blush furiously.

Leilani slides down the wall, collapsing to the floor. She
pulls her knees up to her chest, wrapping her arms around them and resting her
head on top of her arms, an ugly scowl on her face as she glares at the books
next to her.

Sethren Argyle slips off the desk, sitting down next to you. He moves his hand
to gently stroke your hair again, watching you intently. "Now, should continue
what we were talking about before..tell me more about yourself. Why did you
join the Wytchen to begin with?".

Sethren sits down.

You stare implacably about yourself.

Leilani leans heavily back against the wall, choosing her
words carefully.

You say, "Freedom and the ideal of Coterie, which they failed to uphold.
Freedom..of spirit is important to me."

You glare angrily at Sethren.

You say, "Coterie is equally important."

Sethren Argyle says, "But there&#39;s no reason to think of something like that as
important, right?"

Sethren Argyle says, "The guild that it is now.."

Sethren shudders violently.

You say, "Family and duty are the vital balances to freedom, without duty to
something greater than yourself, freedom can turn you into nothing more than a
spoiled child, as has happened to the guild."

Sethren nods his head.

You say, "The Coterie still exists, there are those who are still wytchen in
their heart, who still uphold the values that the guild once abided by."

Sethren Argyle says, "I see..that&#39;s why it&#39;s because it&#39;s what it is now."

You frown and say, "The guild is -not- the Coterie. Nor will it ever be again,
I fear."

Sethren Argyle says, "Not enough to remind them they have something higher
they&#39;re supposed to be devoted to."

You slump down dejectedly.

You frown and say, "I tried, I tried...so hard.. through my words. Through my
writing. They didn&#39;t listen. I am not .. charismatic, or manipulative, enough
to force them to pay attention."

Sethren Argyle says, "I&#39;m sure you did try, though."

You say, "I did..."

Sethren Argyle says, "And what did you do before that?"

Leilani pulls her tome from her pouch, running her hands over
its familiar cover absentmindedly as a thoughtful look crosses herface.

Leilani snaps her head up, her momentary daydreaming broken by
your words.

You say, "Before...what?"

Sethren Argyle says, "Well..before you joined the Wytchen."

Sethren ponders the situation.

You say, "I wandered."

You shrug helplessly.

Sethren Argyle says, "Just wandered? You didn&#39;t have anyone?"

You say, "...I have never had anyone. I think I must have had parents, but I
can&#39;t remember them..."

Sethren whispers to you, "I&#39;ll be back in just a moment."

Sethren leaves to the southeast.

Leilani wraps her arms around herself, shivering lightly as
she leans back against the wall, her eyes falling closed.

Sethren arrives from the southwest.

Sethren sits down.

Leilani sighs heavily, her eyes fluttering open as she hears
you enter the room.

Sethren Argyle says, "Good..you stayed."

Sethren&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "So.."

Sethren Argyle says, "If you have never really had anymore before..why are you
so set against what I want?"

Leilani opens her mouth to respond, then sharply closes it,
frowning to herself as she ponders her words.

Sethren gazes intently at you, his forked tongue flickering inquisitively.

You angrily say, "Because you chased me down... threw me to the ground, because
you have hurt me and stolen from me. Because you seek to own me, and not to
know me for who I am. You wish to possess me and that is just not how such
things work."

Sethren Argyle says, "Perhaps I want both."

Sethren Argyle says, "I will own you, but I do think I will..get to know who
you are, in the process."

You blush furiously.

You say, "...you think you will own me."

Sethren Argyle says, "No."

Sethren Argyle says, "I know I will own you."

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "It is simply a matter of time."

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.

Leilani growls, her eyes flashing with anger as you pat her.
She scoots herself away from you.

Sethren Argyle takes your wrist and forcefully pulls you back against him,
smirking slightly. "Just..stay there, pet.".

Leilani blinks hard, shivering as you pull her closer to you,
unaccustomed to such close contact with another. Despite her obvious
discomfort, she remains, grumbling softly under her breath.

Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, though a little surprised at you shivering.
"Hm..interesting reaction there. Let&#39;s see.." He wraps his arms around your
waist, pulling you into his lap. "You should get used to such closeness with
me..well, you&#39;re going to have to, anyway."

Leilani blushes brightly, squirming as if she wants to climb
away from you, yet she remains. Her breath coming fast, a look of pure hatred
crosses her face. Her petite hands are clenched into tight fists, her long
nails cutting little half moons into her palms. drawing the smallest traces of
blood forth from the injured flesh.

Sethren Argyle murmurs under his breath, noticing your clenched fists. He
whispers against your ear, "You shouldn&#39;t hurt yourself..you know I&#39;ll do
plenty of that for you if you continue like this."

Leilani glances down at her clenched fists with surprise,
gasping as she realizes what she was doing. Slowly she relaxes her hands,
flexing her fingers slowly as she peers curiously at her hands.

You whisper to Sethren, "...thank you."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Sethren Argyle runs his hand rather tenderly down your back, his tail wrapping
lightly around your waist. "Is this really so bad?"

Leilani closes her eyes for a moment, drawing in a deep
breath. "This is not what it seems to be. No happy couple spending quality
time. This is prey and predator. Your false affection does not fool me."

Sethren Argyle says, "Predator..I rather like that term."

Sethren smirks.

You growl menacingly.

You say, "It suits you."

Sethren Argyle says, "And you may think it false..it really doesn&#39;t matter."

Sethren Argyle says, "So..what have you been absorbed in since you left the
Wytchen? Your books?"

You say, "I ... have wandered mostly without purpose. I devoted myself entirely
to the Coterie. Now we are spread few and far between. I do not know... what...
no, nevermind."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Sethren Argyle says, "You don&#39;t know what to do next?"

Sethren pats you in a friendly manner.

You say, "That will do."

Sethren Argyle says, "You don&#39;t have to worry, you know."

Sethren Argyle says, "About things most do.."

You raise an eyebrow questioningly.

You say, "What things would that be?"

Sethren Argyle says, "You always have something..well, someone. To be devoted
to."

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

You narrow your eyes to thin slits.

You say, "Devotion should be freely given, it cannot be stolen."

Sethren Argyle says, "Yes, it can be."

You say, "...we shall see, won&#39;t we."

Sethren Argyle says, "So."

Sethren Argyle says, "When do you think you will actually have a chance to
succeed?"

Your eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say, "Mind sitting still while I make a nice doll of you?"

Sethren smirks.

Sethren Argyle says, "And you&#39;d still be able to do little with it."

You say, "Hmm, is that a yes, then?"

Sethren Argyle says, "No."

You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.

Sethren Argyle ponders you for a moment, his hand caressing your shoulder
lightly. He slightly unlaces the back of your corset, hand slipping underneath
to run his nails over your back, still gentle. "Hm..I wonder how you would
react if I took it off entirely."

Leilani grasps at her corset, springing from your lap in an
instant, and flees out of the library.

-run, little bird, run-
Within a spacious room. (Ssyra.)
Woven grass mats cover the wooden floors of this large, brightly lit home. The
single spacious room has been divided into sections by several simple folding
screens made from nearly transluscent papyrus. The surface of the screens has
been brightly painted with vivid depictions of totem animals, with serpents and
leopards and alligators predominating in the designs. The fire stone - a large
rock hollowed out to hold a small flame - sits in its traditional place at the
center of the room, and the clay jugs and pottery have been carefully tucked
away into niches within the walls of the house. The low hanging ceiling boasts
a number of brightly painted branches, the blue, green and red streaks of
colour intertwining for a pleasant and cheery appearance. You see a single exit
leading east (open door).

You close the door to the east.

You shiver violently.

The door to the east is opened from the other side.

Sethren moves over to block the east exit.

Sethren smirks.

Sethren Argyle says, "Cute.."

Leilani whimpers, backing up into a far corner.

Sethren closes the door to the east.

Sethren Argyle smiles coldly, moving closer to you. He reaches down and takes
hold of your hair, pulling you up with your back against him. He takes both of
your arms, pulling them behind you and securing you tightly. Leaning closer, he
whispers into your ear, "That was a terribly stupid thing to do. But..I&#39;m glad.
There&#39;s things to try..."

Leilani growly angrily, "Leave me be!" she screams as she
tries to squirm her way out of your grip. She kicks your foot hard, trying to
escape by any means.

Sethren Argyle lets go, pushing you up against the wall of the room, his hand
around your neck. He presses down hard, cutting off your air supply. He doesn&#39;t
offer you a way out this time, though, simply staring emotionlessly at you.

Leilani gasps in surprise as she&#39;s tossed against the wall.
She struggles in vain to draw a breath as your hand wraps around her neck,
trembling with fear as her pale eyes plead with you for release. She manages to
rasp out, "Please... don&#39;t..."

Sethren Argyle whips his tail back and forth behind him, anger evident in his
eyes now. "You promised me that you wouldn&#39;t attempt to escape. But..mm..you
did. Of course you did. WHY should I let you go?" He presses down a little
harder, staring intently at you.

Leilani draws in what little air she can, gasping for breath
as her face grows very pale. She manages to whimper out, "Please... I will
behave... please...just stop."

Sethren Argyle suddenly lets go of your neck and steps back a bit, leaving you
entirely unsupported.

Leilani collapses to the floor, her hands flying to her throat
as she gulps in air, shaking violently as tears stream down her face.

Sethren Argyle watches you intently, not a trace of pity in his eyes. "Stand
up, now."

Leilani struggles to rise to her feet, fearfully cowering
before you on shaky legs. She stares hard at the ground, her arms wrapped
tightly around her midsection.

Sethren&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "Mhm..you should be cowering.."

Leilani sniffles quietly, drawing in a shaky breath as she
whispers in a raspy voice, "Please.. you had your fun now go away."

Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, "And, now..I want you to remove your corset.
But..keep this in mind. Do you -really- want to say "no" to me.." and at this
point he grins, a strange ferocity in his eyes, "..now?"

Leilani sobs at your words, falling to her knees. "Please...
please don&#39;t make me do that," she whimpers in a raspy voice.

Sethren Argyle shakes his head, "You don&#39;t have a choice. Now, or it will be
much worse for you."

Sethren Argyle says, "But..do stay kneeling. I don&#39;t want you trying to run off
again."

Leilani shudders, crying softly as she begins to unhook each
of the silver clasps at the front of the corset with shaky fingers. She fumbles
several times, grumbling under her breath at each turn. Finally, she lets it
drop to the floor at her feet, glaring defiantly up at you as she shivers at
the cold breeze against her exposed flesh.

Sethren Argyle nods, moving behind you and crouching down. He pulls a length of
rope from his pouch, pulling your arms behind your back and tying your wrists
tightly, and quite uncomfortably. "There..that&#39;s better. No getting away for
you now."

Leilani shifts uncomfortably, trying to adjust her wrists to
ease the pain, to no avail. She winces as the rough rope rubs against her
already sore flesh. Sighing softly, she resigns herself to the bindings, and
turns her attention to you, her eyes follow your every move as she trembles,
the fiery passion in her eyes laced with the cold edge of fear.

Sethren Argyle examines you closely, slowly slipping his dirk out of his pouch.
He runs the cold metal very lightly down your back, the point against your
skin, but not digging in at all. "Mm..this is only going to be the first part,
though. If I only use physical means as..punishment, well, it&#39;ll be hard to
break you. But you will see the other method in time."

Leilani trembles in fear, her body arching out of the way of
the sharp metal. A low whimper escapes her lips and she tries to scoot away,
not making very much progress on bended knee with her arms bound.
"...please...just leave me be," she rasps.

Sethren Argyle ignores your pleas, suddenly pressing the dirk into your back.
He slashes downwards, cutting fairly deeply into your skin. The cut causes
blood to stream down your back, and he stops for a moment, seeming almost
transfixed by it. He finishes the cut, removing the dirk and slowly licking the
blood from it.

Leilani arches her back forward away from the cruel dirk,
crying out as the blade digs into her flesh. Her entire body trembling
violently, "Please, no, Gods please stop," she whimpers. She nearly collapses
to the floor as you remove the dirk, panting heavily. She grows pale as she
feels the warm trickle of blood running down her back, and tears spill over her
lashes.

Sethren Argyle narrows his eyes slightly at your words. "Be silent. Or do I
need to gag you?"

Sethren smirks.

Leilani whimpers softly, biting down on her lower lip as she
shrinks down, fearfully listening to your every move.

Sethren Argyle nods to himself, slashing into your back in one smooth motion,
deeper this time. He grins slightly, watching the blood drip down onto the
floor. His fingers run slowly down your back and over the cuts, coming off with
blood that he promptly licks off. "Mm..as fun as I thought it would be. Glad
you tried to escape.."

Leilani cries silently to herself, her face etched with pain
as she struggles to hold back screams. Beads of sweat form on her flesh and she
begins to grow lightheaded, swaying lightly as the room begins to spin. Her
entire body trembles violently in fear, as she cowers before you.

Sethren Argyle drags his dirk slowly down your back again, cutting a gash to
accompany the other two. Your back bleeding rather profusely now, he sets the
dirk aside for now. Hands rubbing over your back, he presses his nails into the
cuts, causing even more pain.

Leilani lets out an agonized scream, unable to hold it in any
longer. She seems to find a moment of relief as she hears the dirk being set
aside, but it is soon replaced by another pain-filled screech as your nails dig
into her injure flesh. She reacts without thinking, trying desperately to pull
herself away from the source of the pain, succeeding only in tightening the
bonds around her wrists as she nearly blacks out.

Sethren Argyle presses his nails deeper, and holds them there. He whispers
against your ear, "You were only expecting to be slapped around, weren&#39;t you?
You didn&#39;t think it would actually hurt? But, well. I&#39;m sure you want this to
stop.  Will you try to escape again?"

Leilani whimpers pitifully, unable to reign in her desperate
sobbing as she shakes her head violently, "Please...stop...I will behave. I
will do as you ask, just.. please...stop," she rasps quietly.

Sethren Argyle withdraws his nails from your back calmly, watching you as he
carefully licks his fingers clean.

Leilani pants softly, unable to stop shivering as she sobs
quietly to herself, her head hung dejectedly down. Occasionally whimpering in
pain as a slight muscle shift causes her wounds to stretch.

Sethren Argyle unties the rope around your wrists, freeing them. "Such pretty
blood..rather enjoyable, that. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve learned, but..I&#39;m going to
be sure. No, not with cutting you some more..something more subtle."

Sethren&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Leilani twitches slightly at your words, panic filling her
eyes as she stares up at you, shivering uncontrollably.

Leilani rubs her wrists slightly, wincing as she catches sight
of the bruised flesh.

Sethren Argyle says, "Now..turn around and face me..sit down, make yourself as
comfortable as you can right now."

Leilani leans forward, placing her weight gingerly on all
fours as she slowly spins around. Carefully sit sits down, cross-legged. Each
movement is bought with sharp pain, and she moans softly with each new burst.
The wounds, which had begun to close themselves, send fresh rivulets of blood
down her flesh. Shuddering, she finally sits up straight, wrapping her arms
around her midsection as she stares up at you, a blank look on her face as she
awaits the next torment.

Sethren Argyle sits down carefully opposite you, cross legged as well, watching
your face carefully.

Sethren sits down.

Sethren Argyle says, "Relax, little one..I&#39;m not going to hurt you."

Sethren Argyle says, "Not right now, anyway."

You whimper like a wounded puppy.

Leilani peers at you nervously, still shivering lightly, but
otherwise she remains very still and silent.

Sethren Argyle stares into your eyes, speaking in a quite calm, soothing tone.
"Close your eyes..relax."

Leilani gazes at you, a look of confusion crossing her face at
the sound of your voice. Her lashes begin to flutter and she seems to fight it
for a moment, but they finally fall closed, and her face smooths as she begins
to slowly relax.

Sethren Argyle continues speaking in the same tone, not making any sudden moves
and keeping entirely still. "Focus on the faintness you&#39;re feeling..block out
everything else but it and the sound of my voice. Breathe deeply..slowly."

Sethren Argyle continues in the rather monotone voice, "Block out everything
else but the sound of my voice. Nothing else concerns you..you are entirely
relaxed..comfortable. You don&#39;t feel any pain."

Argyle keeps perfectly still, not wanting to make any noises to break
the trance. "Now..you are sinking further. You will not remember what I tell
you from here on out. When I snap my fingers..you will come out of the trance.
Nod once if you understand."

Leilani nods once, slowly.

Sethren Argyle speaks more slowly, wanting to make sure his words have the full
impact they are meant to. "Now..when I say a certain phrase, you will come to
me. No matter what obstacles you need to overcome to get me..you will come.
Even if you have to cross Aetherius to reach me. Do you understand?".

Leilani nods slowly, a dreamy look crossing her face as she
slurrs, "I will come to you at all costs," in a raspy voice.

Sethren Argyle allows a hint of of being pleased to enter his voice now, the
suggestion almost implanted. "The phrase is simply.."Come to me." No other
combination of words will make it happen. And if anyone but me says the word,
it will not work. Do you understand this?".

Leilani nods slowly, whispering the words to herself, as if to
strengthen the suggestion in her own mind.

Sethren Argyle smiles, speaking again in the same calm voice. "Now, when I snap
my fingers you will remember nothing of this. However, you will still come to
me when I speak that phrase. Nod again if you understand."

You nod your acknowledgement of Sethren.

Sethren Argyle snaps his fingers in front of you, remaining absolutely still
otherwise, and watching you closely.

Leilani flutters her eyes open, staring about a bit dazed as
she slowly recovers from her groggy state. She starts as she remembers where
she is, glaring at you suspiciously, as she scratches unknowingly at her thighs
in her nervousness.

Sethren&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Sethren Argyle says, "You slept well, I hope."

You frown at Sethren.

Sethren Argyle says, "Don&#39;t you feel somewhat..refreshed?"

Leilani frowns, a look of confusing crossing her face for a
moment. She peers suspiciously at you, "...I do," she rasps.

Sethren Argyle says, "I think the corset will be a bit..painful at the moment.
But I don&#39;t want you to be cold."

Sethren gives a somber cloak lined in cerulean to you.

Sethren Argyle says, "Wear this for now."

Leilani carefully wraps herself up in the cloak, wincing as
the fabric brushes against her wounded flesh.

Sethren Argyle says, "I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t take very long to heal."

You glare angrily at Sethren.

Sethren strokes you tenderly.

Sethren Argyle says, "Watch where you glare."

Sethren&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Leilani whimpers, shivering nervously at your touch.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hrm..I am sure you can use something to drink."

Sethren Argyle picks up his dirk from the floor, then stands up. He takes your
hand in his, pulling you upright rather gently.

Sethren Argyle says, "Follow me."

Leilani leans into you, by necessity, as her legs start to go out from under her.
She pants softly, struggling to maintain her balance.

You begin to follow Sethren.

Sethren Argyle helps you to stay upright, holding you carefully against him.
"There..little more stable now?".

Leilani nods slowly, side stepping away from you as soon as
she is able to stay upright.

Sethren Argyle takes your hand, half for a bit of a support, but also to keep
you with him.

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "I&#39;ll walk a little slower."

Sethren&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Sethren opens the door to the east.
You follow Sethren to the east.'>Your ally, Sethren Argyle, has entered Imperian.
-wanders off to find him-
Imperial Parade nearing the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Bearing
the Imperial seal of Stavenn, a black marble bench is here. A sigil in the
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A kohdon scout stands
here eyeing his surroundings with an impassionated stare. A menacing mahogany
chair sprouts from the floor here like a leafless barren tree. A short-legged
and chunky hound sniffs at the air here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a cannon
here. He has forty cannon balls.
You see exits leading east, west (open door), and northwest.
You give a pained sigh.
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
You glare angrily at Sethren.
Sethren whispers to you, "Good girl."
Sethren smiles pleasantly at you, his tail swinging slowly behind him.
You whisper to Sethren, "I did not feel like being slapped around again, it
does not mean I am seeking your company for my own pleasure."
You growl menacingly.
Sethren beckons you to him.
You begin to follow Sethren.
Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure."
Sethren smirks.
You follow Sethren to the northwest.
-wandering-
A dim study in the Academy. (City of Stavenn.)
The back room of the Academy is shaped like a half-circle. The ceiling is flat,
and where the wall meets has marbleized molding of battles. Six columns
protrude from the wall, each crafted in the shape of an ominous, hooded figure.
Silver braziers take up the spaces between all of the columns, illuminating the
dark chamber with their golden light. The floor underfoot is the same crimson
marble with golden and white veins as decorates the entrance, and is also as
well-polished. A small bookcase rests against the flat wall near the door. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A carved stone bowl rests here,
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. An elegantly crafted
desk of charred redwood rests in a corner. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A partially-burnt letter has been left
here carelessly.
You see exits leading southeast and southwest.
Sethren takes a seat on an elegant desk.
Sethren Argyle says, "Somewhat surprised that you did come, though."
Leilani leans against the bookcase, her hands folded neatly in
front of her back, glaring miserably at you.
Sethren Argyle says, "You've been so stubborn up to this point."
Sethren creases his brow in a frown.
You say, "I am stubborn, but I am not stupid. You can find me, do not think I
have accepted your supposed ownership of me. I simply have no wish to be
injured. Eventually I will find the way to remove your disturbing presence from
my life."
"Mhmm," Sethren murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.
Sethren Argyle says, "Sure you will."
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Sethren Argyle says, "So..you won't give up yet, hm? I won't even bother
asking."
Sethren Argyle says, "I will change that soon enough."
Leilani grumbles under her breath, her fingertips brushing the
newly bared skin at her neck without thinking as she stares hard at the
ceiling.
Sethren Argyle stands up slowly, moving closer and taking hold of the pendant
around your neck. "Hm..from the Wytchen, isn't it?"
Leilani presses back hard against the bookcase, shrinking away
from your touch, "...yes, why?" she whispers in a suspicious tone.
Sethren Argyle swishes his tail slowly back and forth, "Are you still a
Wytch?"
You ponder the situation.
Sethren Argyle says, "I simply wish to know more about you, nothing to worry
about."
You say, "I am still a wytch, I am no longer a member of the pathetic guild who
claims that name."
Sethren nods his head.
Sethren Argyle says, "I've heard quite a few speak of the guild in that way."
You frown and say, "With good reason, I am sure."
Sethren Argyle says, "But..hm..something I was going to do either way."
Sethren Argyle says, "Take off the pendant."
You say, "...no."
You say, "Why?"
You peer at Sethren unscrupulously.
Sethren Argyle says, "Give it to me."
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Sethren Argyle says, "Or I'll just take it."
You say, "I do not wish to. It is a symbol of who I am. Why do you need it?"
You growl menacingly.
Sethren Argyle says, "Because you have no need of such symbols."
Sethren Argyle says, "You are mine. That is all you are."
You narrow your eyes to thin slits.
You say, "I will not give it to you, it belongs to me."
Sethren Argyle grins slightly, "I was hoping you would say that.." Without
warning he takes hold of the pendant again, yanking it from your neck and
breaking the chain.
Leilani gasps, clutching desperately where the pendant hangs,
too late to save it from your grasping fingers. She blinks rapidly, holding
back her tears stubbornly. She glares up at you, reaching up a hand to slap you
hard across the face.
You exclaim, "You are nothing but a bully. I do not belong to you, stop
treating me this way!"
Sethren Argyle blinks as the slap catches him off guard and makes contact. He
smirks, responding by shoving you against the wall hard, his weight keeping you
pressed up against it. "I love getting those sort of reactions out of
you..though I'm surprised you thought to do that."
Leilani shakes with rage, a satisfied glint reaching her eyes
as her hand makes contact against your face. She winces as she feels the
bookshelf slamming against her already sore body, causing her to draw in a
sharp breath. She growls angrily at your words, her entire form trembling
visibly as she tries to push out from beneath you.
Sethren Argyle only presses you harder into the bookcase at your reaction,
tilting his head curiously at you. "And what do you think you'd accomplish if
you got away from me?" His tail wraps slowly around you, further keeping you
still.
Leilani growls angrily, "I'd at least get your filthy hands
off me. Give back the pendant, it belongs to me."
Sethren whispers to you, "Sorry, little one. But it's mine now. And if you say
something like that to me again..well, you'll regret it. Trust me."
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
You grumble angrily.
Sethren Argyle lets go of you, drawing back a bit and returning to his position
on the desk.
Sethren takes a seat on an elegant desk.
Sethren Argyle says, "I really don't think you need that pendant anyway."
Leilani slumps down a bit, a look of sheer frustration on her
face as she rubs her sore back. Your words cause her to look up in alarm,
peering suspiciously at you, "Why wouldn't I?" she asks.
Sethren Argyle says, "Because it exists simply as a reminder of your old life.
It might bring you thoughts of..escape. And those are likely bad things for
you."
Sethren Argyle says, "Perhaps when I have finally made you realize that you are
mine and that will not change, I'll give you back the pendant and collar
as..keepsakes."
You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.
You say, "I think I would prefer your... company to that of my old guild."
Sethren smirks.
You angrily say, "But that does not mean I do not wish the pendant back."
Sethren Argyle says, "So it didn't really mean that much to you?"
You say, "It belongs to me."
You say, "You do not have the right to take what is mine."
Sethren Argyle says, "And you belong to me. So it follows that..it belongs to
me as well."
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
You say, "I do not belong to you. I simply have not found my method of escape
yet."
You grumble angrily.
Sethren Argyle says, "I'm waiting for this escape attempt of yours. Somewhat
looking forward to making you bleed a bit."
Sethren licks a needle-pointed dirk.
Leilani pales visibly, and she tries to mask it with a wry
grin. "That would require you catching me first. I told you the attempt will be
made when I am sure of its success."
Sethren Argyle stretches languidly, seeming entirely unconcerned. "Oh..I'm
sure."
You give a pained sigh.
Sethren Argyle says, "I'll be ever so hard pressed to take you back.."
Sethren smirks.
You blush furiously.
Leilani slides down the wall, collapsing to the floor. She
pulls her knees up to her chest, wrapping her arms around them and resting her
head on top of her arms, an ugly scowl on her face as she glares at the books
next to her.
Sethren Argyle slips off the desk, sitting down next to you. He moves his hand
to gently stroke your hair again, watching you intently. "Now, should continue
what we were talking about before..tell me more about yourself. Why did you
join the Wytchen to begin with?".
Sethren sits down.
You stare implacably about yourself.
Leilani leans heavily back against the wall, choosing her
words carefully.
You say, "Freedom and the ideal of Coterie, which they failed to uphold.
Freedom..of spirit is important to me."
You glare angrily at Sethren.
You say, "Coterie is equally important."
Sethren Argyle says, "But there's no reason to think of something like that as
important, right?"
Sethren Argyle says, "The guild that it is now.."
Sethren shudders violently.
You say, "Family and duty are the vital balances to freedom, without duty to
something greater than yourself, freedom can turn you into nothing more than a
spoiled child, as has happened to the guild."
Sethren nods his head.
You say, "The Coterie still exists, there are those who are still wytchen in
their heart, who still uphold the values that the guild once abided by."
Sethren Argyle says, "I see..that's why it's because it's what it is now."
You frown and say, "The guild is -not- the Coterie. Nor will it ever be again,
I fear."
Sethren Argyle says, "Not enough to remind them they have something higher
they're supposed to be devoted to."
You slump down dejectedly.
You frown and say, "I tried, I tried...so hard.. through my words. Through my
writing. They didn't listen. I am not .. charismatic, or manipulative, enough
to force them to pay attention."
Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure you did try, though."
You say, "I did..."
Sethren Argyle says, "And what did you do before that?"
Leilani pulls her tome from her pouch, running her hands over
its familiar cover absentmindedly as a thoughtful look crosses herface.
Leilani snaps her head up, her momentary daydreaming broken by
your words.
You say, "Before...what?"
Sethren Argyle says, "Well..before you joined the Wytchen."
Sethren ponders the situation.
You say, "I wandered."
You shrug helplessly.
Sethren Argyle says, "Just wandered? You didn't have anyone?"
You say, "...I have never had anyone. I think I must have had parents, but I
can't remember them..."
Sethren whispers to you, "I'll be back in just a moment."
Sethren leaves to the southeast.
Leilani wraps her arms around herself, shivering lightly as
she leans back against the wall, her eyes falling closed.
Sethren arrives from the southwest.
Sethren sits down.
Leilani sighs heavily, her eyes fluttering open as she hears
you enter the room.
Sethren Argyle says, "Good..you stayed."
Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
You give a pained sigh.
Sethren Argyle says, "So.."
Sethren Argyle says, "If you have never really had anymore before..why are you
so set against what I want?"
Leilani opens her mouth to respond, then sharply closes it,
frowning to herself as she ponders her words.
Sethren gazes intently at you, his forked tongue flickering inquisitively.
You angrily say, "Because you chased me down... threw me to the ground, because
you have hurt me and stolen from me. Because you seek to own me, and not to
know me for who I am. You wish to possess me and that is just not how such
things work."
Sethren Argyle says, "Perhaps I want both."
Sethren Argyle says, "I will own you, but I do think I will..get to know who
you are, in the process."
You blush furiously.
You say, "...you think you will own me."
Sethren Argyle says, "No."
Sethren Argyle says, "I know I will own you."
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Sethren Argyle says, "It is simply a matter of time."
You give a pained sigh.
Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.
Leilani growls, her eyes flashing with anger as you pat her.
She scoots herself away from you.
Sethren Argyle takes your wrist and forcefully pulls you back against him,
smirking slightly. "Just..stay there, pet.".
Leilani blinks hard, shivering as you pull her closer to you,
unaccustomed to such close contact with another. Despite her obvious
discomfort, she remains, grumbling softly under her breath.
Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, though a little surprised at you shivering.
"Hm..interesting reaction there. Let's see.." He wraps his arms around your
waist, pulling you into his lap. "You should get used to such closeness with
me..well, you're going to have to, anyway."
Leilani blushes brightly, squirming as if she wants to climb
away from you, yet she remains. Her breath coming fast, a look of pure hatred
crosses her face. Her petite hands are clenched into tight fists, her long
nails cutting little half moons into her palms. drawing the smallest traces of
blood forth from the injured flesh.
Sethren Argyle murmurs under his breath, noticing your clenched fists. He
whispers against your ear, "You shouldn't hurt yourself..you know I'll do
plenty of that for you if you continue like this."
Leilani glances down at her clenched fists with surprise,
gasping as she realizes what she was doing. Slowly she relaxes her hands,
flexing her fingers slowly as she peers curiously at her hands.
You whisper to Sethren, "...thank you."
You crease your brow in a frown.
Sethren Argyle runs his hand rather tenderly down your back, his tail wrapping
lightly around your waist. "Is this really so bad?"
Leilani closes her eyes for a moment, drawing in a deep
breath. "This is not what it seems to be. No happy couple spending quality
time. This is prey and predator. Your false affection does not fool me."
Sethren Argyle says, "Predator..I rather like that term."
Sethren smirks.
You growl menacingly.
You say, "It suits you."
Sethren Argyle says, "And you may think it false..it really doesn't matter."
Sethren Argyle says, "So..what have you been absorbed in since you left the
Wytchen? Your books?"
You say, "I ... have wandered mostly without purpose. I devoted myself entirely
to the Coterie. Now we are spread few and far between. I do not know... what...
no, nevermind."
You crease your brow in a frown.
Sethren Argyle says, "You don't know what to do next?"
Sethren pats you in a friendly manner.
You say, "That will do."
Sethren Argyle says, "You don't have to worry, you know."
Sethren Argyle says, "About things most do.."
You raise an eyebrow questioningly.
You say, "What things would that be?"
Sethren Argyle says, "You always have something..well, someone. To be devoted
to."
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
You narrow your eyes to thin slits.
You say, "Devotion should be freely given, it cannot be stolen."
Sethren Argyle says, "Yes, it can be."
You say, "...we shall see, won't we."
Sethren Argyle says, "So."
Sethren Argyle says, "When do you think you will actually have a chance to
succeed?"
Your eyes sparkle with amusement.
You say, "Mind sitting still while I make a nice doll of you?"
Sethren smirks.
Sethren Argyle says, "And you'd still be able to do little with it."
You say, "Hmm, is that a yes, then?"
Sethren Argyle says, "No."
You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.
Sethren Argyle ponders you for a moment, his hand caressing your shoulder
lightly. He slightly unlaces the back of your corset, hand slipping underneath
to run his nails over your back, still gentle. "Hm..I wonder how you would
react if I took it off entirely."
Leilani grasps at her corset, springing from your lap in an
instant, and flees out of the library.
-run, little bird, run-
Within a spacious room. (Ssyra.)
Woven grass mats cover the wooden floors of this large, brightly lit home. The
single spacious room has been divided into sections by several simple folding
screens made from nearly transluscent papyrus. The surface of the screens has
been brightly painted with vivid depictions of totem animals, with serpents and
leopards and alligators predominating in the designs. The fire stone - a large
rock hollowed out to hold a small flame - sits in its traditional place at the
center of the room, and the clay jugs and pottery have been carefully tucked
away into niches within the walls of the house. The low hanging ceiling boasts
a number of brightly painted branches, the blue, green and red streaks of
colour intertwining for a pleasant and cheery appearance. You see a single exit
leading east (open door).
You close the door to the east.
You shiver violently.
The door to the east is opened from the other side.
Sethren moves over to block the east exit.
Sethren smirks.
Sethren Argyle says, "Cute.."
Leilani whimpers, backing up into a far corner.
Sethren closes the door to the east.
Sethren Argyle smiles coldly, moving closer to you. He reaches down and takes
hold of your hair, pulling you up with your back against him. He takes both of
your arms, pulling them behind you and securing you tightly. Leaning closer, he
whispers into your ear, "That was a terribly stupid thing to do. But..I'm glad.
There's things to try..."
Leilani growly angrily, "Leave me be!" she screams as she
tries to squirm her way out of your grip. She kicks your foot hard, trying to
escape by any means.
Sethren Argyle lets go, pushing you up against the wall of the room, his hand
around your neck. He presses down hard, cutting off your air supply. He doesn't
offer you a way out this time, though, simply staring emotionlessly at you.
Leilani gasps in surprise as she's tossed against the wall.
She struggles in vain to draw a breath as your hand wraps around her neck,
trembling with fear as her pale eyes plead with you for release. She manages to
rasp out, "Please... don't..."
Sethren Argyle whips his tail back and forth behind him, anger evident in his
eyes now. "You promised me that you wouldn't attempt to escape. But..mm..you
did. Of course you did. WHY should I let you go?" He presses down a little
harder, staring intently at you.
Leilani draws in what little air she can, gasping for breath
as her face grows very pale. She manages to whimper out, "Please... I will
behave... please...just stop."
Sethren Argyle suddenly lets go of your neck and steps back a bit, leaving you
entirely unsupported.
Leilani collapses to the floor, her hands flying to her throat
as she gulps in air, shaking violently as tears stream down her face.
Sethren Argyle watches you intently, not a trace of pity in his eyes. "Stand
up, now."
Leilani struggles to rise to her feet, fearfully cowering
before you on shaky legs. She stares hard at the ground, her arms wrapped
tightly around her midsection.
Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Sethren Argyle says, "Mhm..you should be cowering.."
Leilani sniffles quietly, drawing in a shaky breath as she
whispers in a raspy voice, "Please.. you had your fun now go away."
Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, "And, now..I want you to remove your corset.
But..keep this in mind. Do you -really- want to say "no" to me.." and at this
point he grins, a strange ferocity in his eyes, "..now?"
Leilani sobs at your words, falling to her knees. "Please...
please don't make me do that," she whimpers in a raspy voice.
Sethren Argyle shakes his head, "You don't have a choice. Now, or it will be
much worse for you."
Sethren Argyle says, "But..do stay kneeling. I don't want you trying to run off
again."
Leilani shudders, crying softly as she begins to unhook each
of the silver clasps at the front of the corset with shaky fingers. She fumbles
several times, grumbling under her breath at each turn. Finally, she lets it
drop to the floor at her feet, glaring defiantly up at you as she shivers at
the cold breeze against her exposed flesh.
Sethren Argyle nods, moving behind you and crouching down. He pulls a length of
rope from his pouch, pulling your arms behind your back and tying your wrists
tightly, and quite uncomfortably. "There..that's better. No getting away for
you now."
Leilani shifts uncomfortably, trying to adjust her wrists to
ease the pain, to no avail. She winces as the rough rope rubs against her
already sore flesh. Sighing softly, she resigns herself to the bindings, and
turns her attention to you, her eyes follow your every move as she trembles,
the fiery passion in her eyes laced with the cold edge of fear.
Sethren Argyle examines you closely, slowly slipping his dirk out of his pouch.
He runs the cold metal very lightly down your back, the point against your
skin, but not digging in at all. "Mm..this is only going to be the first part,
though. If I only use physical means as..punishment, well, it'll be hard to
break you. But you will see the other method in time."
Leilani trembles in fear, her body arching out of the way of
the sharp metal. A low whimper escapes her lips and she tries to scoot away,
not making very much progress on bended knee with her arms bound.
"...please...just leave me be," she rasps.
Sethren Argyle ignores your pleas, suddenly pressing the dirk into your back.
He slashes downwards, cutting fairly deeply into your skin. The cut causes
blood to stream down your back, and he stops for a moment, seeming almost
transfixed by it. He finishes the cut, removing the dirk and slowly licking the
blood from it.
Leilani arches her back forward away from the cruel dirk,
crying out as the blade digs into her flesh. Her entire body trembling
violently, "Please, no, Gods please stop," she whimpers. She nearly collapses
to the floor as you remove the dirk, panting heavily. She grows pale as she
feels the warm trickle of blood running down her back, and tears spill over her
lashes.
Sethren Argyle narrows his eyes slightly at your words. "Be silent. Or do I
need to gag you?"
Sethren smirks.
Leilani whimpers softly, biting down on her lower lip as she
shrinks down, fearfully listening to your every move.
Sethren Argyle nods to himself, slashing into your back in one smooth motion,
deeper this time. He grins slightly, watching the blood drip down onto the
floor. His fingers run slowly down your back and over the cuts, coming off with
blood that he promptly licks off. "Mm..as fun as I thought it would be. Glad
you tried to escape.."
Leilani cries silently to herself, her face etched with pain
as she struggles to hold back screams. Beads of sweat form on her flesh and she
begins to grow lightheaded, swaying lightly as the room begins to spin. Her
entire body trembles violently in fear, as she cowers before you.
Sethren Argyle drags his dirk slowly down your back again, cutting a gash to
accompany the other two. Your back bleeding rather profusely now, he sets the
dirk aside for now. Hands rubbing over your back, he presses his nails into the
cuts, causing even more pain.
Leilani lets out an agonized scream, unable to hold it in any
longer. She seems to find a moment of relief as she hears the dirk being set
aside, but it is soon replaced by another pain-filled screech as your nails dig
into her injure flesh. She reacts without thinking, trying desperately to pull
herself away from the source of the pain, succeeding only in tightening the
bonds around her wrists as she nearly blacks out.
Sethren Argyle presses his nails deeper, and holds them there. He whispers
against your ear, "You were only expecting to be slapped around, weren't you?
You didn't think it would actually hurt? But, well. I'm sure you want this to
stop. Will you try to escape again?"
Leilani whimpers pitifully, unable to reign in her desperate
sobbing as she shakes her head violently, "Please...stop...I will behave. I
will do as you ask, just.. please...stop," she rasps quietly.
Sethren Argyle withdraws his nails from your back calmly, watching you as he
carefully licks his fingers clean.
Leilani pants softly, unable to stop shivering as she sobs
quietly to herself, her head hung dejectedly down. Occasionally whimpering in
pain as a slight muscle shift causes her wounds to stretch.
Sethren Argyle unties the rope around your wrists, freeing them. "Such pretty
blood..rather enjoyable, that. And I'm sure you've learned, but..I'm going to
be sure. No, not with cutting you some more..something more subtle."
Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
Leilani twitches slightly at your words, panic filling her
eyes as she stares up at you, shivering uncontrollably.
Leilani rubs her wrists slightly, wincing as she catches sight
of the bruised flesh.
Sethren Argyle says, "Now..turn around and face me..sit down, make yourself as
comfortable as you can right now."
Leilani leans forward, placing her weight gingerly on all
fours as she slowly spins around. Carefully sit sits down, cross-legged. Each
movement is bought with sharp pain, and she moans softly with each new burst.
The wounds, which had begun to close themselves, send fresh rivulets of blood
down her flesh. Shuddering, she finally sits up straight, wrapping her arms
around her midsection as she stares up at you, a blank look on her face as she
awaits the next torment.
Sethren Argyle sits down carefully opposite you, cross legged as well, watching
your face carefully.
Sethren sits down.
Sethren Argyle says, "Relax, little one..I'm not going to hurt you."
Sethren Argyle says, "Not right now, anyway."
You whimper like a wounded puppy.
Leilani peers at you nervously, still shivering lightly, but
otherwise she remains very still and silent.
Sethren Argyle stares into your eyes, speaking in a quite calm, soothing tone.
"Close your eyes..relax."
Leilani gazes at you, a look of confusion crossing her face at
the sound of your voice. Her lashes begin to flutter and she seems to fight it
for a moment, but they finally fall closed, and her face smooths as she begins
to slowly relax.
Sethren Argyle continues speaking in the same tone, not making any sudden moves
and keeping entirely still. "Focus on the faintness you're feeling..block out
everything else but it and the sound of my voice. Breathe deeply..slowly."
Sethren Argyle continues in the rather monotone voice, "Block out everything
else but the sound of my voice. Nothing else concerns you..you are entirely
relaxed..comfortable. You don't feel any pain."
Argyle keeps perfectly still, not wanting to make any noises to break
the trance. "Now..you are sinking further. You will not remember what I tell
you from here on out. When I snap my fingers..you will come out of the trance.
Nod once if you understand."
Leilani nods once, slowly.
Sethren Argyle speaks more slowly, wanting to make sure his words have the full
impact they are meant to. "Now..when I say a certain phrase, you will come to
me. No matter what obstacles you need to overcome to get me..you will come.
Even if you have to cross Aetherius to reach me. Do you understand?".
Leilani nods slowly, a dreamy look crossing her face as she
slurrs, "I will come to you at all costs," in a raspy voice.
Sethren Argyle allows a hint of of being pleased to enter his voice now, the
suggestion almost implanted. "The phrase is simply.."Come to me." No other
combination of words will make it happen. And if anyone but me says the word,
it will not work. Do you understand this?".
Leilani nods slowly, whispering the words to herself, as if to
strengthen the suggestion in her own mind.
Sethren Argyle smiles, speaking again in the same calm voice. "Now, when I snap
my fingers you will remember nothing of this. However, you will still come to
me when I speak that phrase. Nod again if you understand."
You nod your acknowledgement of Sethren.
Sethren Argyle snaps his fingers in front of you, remaining absolutely still
otherwise, and watching you closely.
Leilani flutters her eyes open, staring about a bit dazed as
she slowly recovers from her groggy state. She starts as she remembers where
she is, glaring at you suspiciously, as she scratches unknowingly at her thighs
in her nervousness.
Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
Sethren Argyle says, "You slept well, I hope."
You frown at Sethren.
Sethren Argyle says, "Don't you feel somewhat..refreshed?"
Leilani frowns, a look of confusing crossing her face for a
moment. She peers suspiciously at you, "...I do," she rasps.
Sethren Argyle says, "I think the corset will be a bit..painful at the moment.
But I don't want you to be cold."
Sethren gives a somber cloak lined in cerulean to you.
Sethren Argyle says, "Wear this for now."
Leilani carefully wraps herself up in the cloak, wincing as
the fabric brushes against her wounded flesh.
Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure they won't take very long to heal."
You glare angrily at Sethren.
Sethren strokes you tenderly.
Sethren Argyle says, "Watch where you glare."
Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
Leilani whimpers, shivering nervously at your touch.
Sethren Argyle says, "Hrm..I am sure you can use something to drink."
Sethren Argyle picks up his dirk from the floor, then stands up. He takes your
hand in his, pulling you upright rather gently.
Sethren Argyle says, "Follow me."
Leilani leans into you, by necessity, as her legs start to go out from under her.
She pants softly, struggling to maintain her balance.
You begin to follow Sethren.
Sethren Argyle helps you to stay upright, holding you carefully against him.
"There..little more stable now?".
Leilani nods slowly, side stepping away from you as soon as
she is able to stay upright.
Sethren Argyle takes your hand, half for a bit of a support, but also to keep
you with him.
You give a pained sigh.
Sethren Argyle says, "I'll walk a little slower."
Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
Sethren opens the door to the east.
You follow Sethren to the east.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
