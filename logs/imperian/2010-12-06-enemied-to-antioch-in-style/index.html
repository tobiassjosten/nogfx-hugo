Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Tents 
crowd one another on either side of the road. With their flaps rolled up it is 
difficult to tell where one tent ends and the next begins. There are boxes and 
makeshift tables in each tent with various wares for sale. The crowd is very 
loud as people yell to one another about the prices they've found for various 
goods. Now and then the voices of some bargainers will be distinct enough to 
make out the flowery curses they are throwing back and forth. This has been 
marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A delicate
windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. An armoured knight 
has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel before a fierce
lion. The shop directory of Antioch rests here on a marble pedestal. The 
shrunken head of Dias has been staked into the ground here, the last torments 
of life still visible upon his face. A snow-white hammock hangs here, a soft 
melody of chiming beads sounding delicately with the softest breeze. There are 
8 charcoal cinders in a group here. An intricately carved muamrite guard's 
spear lies abandoned here. A sachet of bath salts has been left here, the 
enchanting scent of vanilla wafting from the small parcel. A pike with the 
decapitated head of Mihochi has been erected. Its head poised in a prideful 
stance, a sleek black stallion stands here snorting arrogantly. An elite 
Antioch cleric is manning a cannon here. She has eighty cannon balls. A lean 
coyote prowls around the forest, his nose sniffing along the ground for prey. A
fierce sabretooth tiger prowls silently here. A shaggy grey mustang roams 
warily nearby. A lithe desert fox slinks cunningly nearby. A tengu hovers 
gently over the ground here. A fearsome lion prowls around here and greets you 
with a warning roar. Standing placidly here, a tri-colored paint mare noses 
about, her tail swatting absentmindedly behind her. Defiant in stance, a 
muscular white stallion stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing 
eyes of ice blue. A massive groomed black stallion stands here proudly, its 
large form covered in silver battle armour. Heated breath flaring his nostrils,
a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A large red kangaroo is lounging 
idly here, lazily scratching herself as she gazes around curiously. The Queen 
of the Amazons has been slain, her bloodied corpse rests here. A regal white 
falcon is here, keeping a vigilant watch. Wings quickly darting about, a 
peaceful pink dragonfly hovers here. A black wolf stalks silently here, 
sniffing the air for prey. Lord Aeorden Zaridiux, Crusader of the Suns is 
riding on a majestic stallion encased in veritum armour named Aethon. He wields
a venerated sabre of the Suns in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Blyth, Aspect of Aryana. You see
a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, and northwest.

Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Tents
crowd one another on either side of the road. With their flaps rolled up it is
difficult to tell where one tent ends and the next begins. There are boxes and
makeshift tables in each tent with various wares for sale. The crowd is very
loud as people yell to one another about the prices they've found for various
goods. Now and then the voices of some bargainers will be distinct enough to
make out the flowery curses they are throwing back and forth. This has been
marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A delicate
windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. An armoured knight
has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel before a fierce
lion. The shop directory of Antioch rests here on a marble pedestal. The
shrunken head of Dias has been staked into the ground here, the last torments
of life still visible upon his face. A snow-white hammock hangs here, a soft
melody of chiming beads sounding delicately with the softest breeze. There are

That the current crop of Ithaquans has no idea of the real history, just what someone told them to believe, is no shock to me. Not that I&rsquo;m saying Ithaqua needs to be beholden to Antioch or anything of the sort, but common decency is at least expected, such as obeying laws. You know, the same thing Antiochians do when in Ithaqua.</p><p>Guess I expect too much out of the circle-hopper metagamers.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f82196323cf7d5b4cd8d44608439bf2?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by guardian106@xxx on 08Â Dec 2010</p>Also, it&rsquo;s always been the case that Ithaquans follow Antioch&rsquo;s laws in Antioch.
