Aryana&#39;s Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stone, a grey 
mist surrounds its ethereal light, which is known to be a source of inspiration
and life. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a 
Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera,
a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble
rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop 
an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings.
An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a 
Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here,
marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over 
the Springs. There are 4 corpses of a red-backed vole here. Skeli Xianfu is

an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings.
An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a
Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here,
marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over
the Springs. There are 4 corpses of a red-backed vole here. An undulating mass
of water, cascading and swirling into itself, has settled here. A large red and
brown desert buffalo stands here, claws instead of hooves digging into the
ground with tremendous force. Skeli Xianfu is here, smirking smugly. Elemental
Apprentice, Tyras Da'Saison is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand
and an elemental staff in his right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, and a crumbling pathway leads
down.

&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1289e 1045w &lt;eb>>

Skeli Xianfu says to Tyras, "Wait here for a moment?"
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1290e 1045w &lt;eb>>
Peravus, ancient Caananite strides in from the east with an arrogant look over
his surroundings.

You quickly light your pipes, surrounding yourself with a cloud of smoke.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1290e 1045w &lt;eb>>
Tyras shakes his head.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1290e 1045w &lt;eb>>
Skeli creases his brow in a frown.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1290e 1045w &lt;eb>>

"Be right back!" Skeli cries.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1290e 1045w &lt;eb>>
Skeli leaves to the east.

Your aura of weapons rebounding disappears. (anti-weapon field)
Your aggressive action causes your mask to fall away.
You slowly make your away around behind Tyras, far enough away to remain
inconspicuous.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1286e 1045w &lt;e->>
You have recovered balance.

Glancing about indifferently, Peravus, ancient Caananite strides out to the
east.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1287e 1045w &lt;eb>>
As you approach Tyras's back, you quietly draw your knife to the ready, holding
it low and out of sight.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1287e 1045w &lt;eb>>
With one last, silent step, you find yourself directly behind Tyras and prepare
yourself for the pounce.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1288e 1045w &lt;eb>>
(Ring): Skeli says, "Working?"
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1288e 1045w &lt;eb>>
A flick of the wrist, a flash of your blade, and you take Tyras hostage with
your knife to his throat.
&lt;275/278h 220/229m 1289e 1045w &lt;eb>> execute hostage
You swiftly drag the edge of your knife across Tyras's throat, splitting flesh
and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to flow from the horrible
wound in his neck as he topples to the ground, turning around to give you a
look of despair as the light slowly fades from his eyes.
You have slain Tyras.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stone, a grey
mist surrounds its ethereal light, which is known to be a source of inspiration
and life. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a
Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera,
a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey
granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble
