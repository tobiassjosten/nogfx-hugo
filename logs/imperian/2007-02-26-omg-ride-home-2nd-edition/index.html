You have recovered balance.
&amp;lt;445/445h 336/336m 2126e 1581w 0x &amp;gt;
The bright sun shines down upon you.

As you approach Marckarius&#39;s back, you quietly draw your knife to the ready,

Marckarius reels in his fishing line.
&amp;lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &amp;gt;
Marckarius carefully attaches a pink coloured shrimp to the hook on his fishing
pole.
&amp;lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &amp;gt;
With one last, silent step, you find yourself directly behind Marckarius and 
prepare yourself for the pounce.
&amp;lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &amp;gt;
Marckarius swings a bamboo fishing pole behind his head and whips it forward, 
sending his line sailing away to the north.
&amp;lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &amp;gt;
A flick of the wrist, a flash of your blade, and you take Marckarius hostage 
with your knife to his throat.

You swiftly drag the edge of your knife across Marckarius&#39;s throat, splitting 
flesh and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to flow from the 
horrible wound in his neck as he topples to the ground, turning around to give 
you a look of despair as the light slowly fades from his eyes.
You have slain Marckarius.
