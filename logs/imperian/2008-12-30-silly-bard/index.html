You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, in Akrabi, "He was there when 
Tallasar attempted to Cruel Lament."

Sealia tells you, "Erm..that was during an event."

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "Which does not excuse it."

You tell General Kaethi Kislev, Artisan of Lore and Steel, "(( where did they 
get the idea that these events are ooc? ))."

Kaethi tells you, "((Probably Tallasar. HAI GUYZ. Let&#39;s go do dumb shit and you
can&#39;t get in trouble for it!))."

Sealia tells you, "Umm.. so that&#39;s why you killed Lutina and myself?"

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "Yes."

Sealia tells you, "Gerard is a novice."

Sealia tells you, "Again, I stress that point. Have a nice day."

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "And he participated all on 
his own."

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "Tell him to avoid combat 
situations if he does not wish to be killed."

Sealia tells you, "He did not participate in the lament. There is a difference 
in participation and merely watching, especially for a novice."

Sealia tells you, "It&#39;s like blaming everyone at the Spring because one person 
there dies."

Sealia tells you, "And I believe we can issue you for this."

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "Feel free to try. I am sure 
the Gods will rule in my favor."

Sealia tells you, "If it was outlawed before the event, it would have been 
disabled, dear."

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "There is no reason for me to 
seek your deaths for using it. Do you not wonder why ogres or orcs moved to 
Sodiuar Lake?"

Gerard tells you, "Sorry my guild mates are making a big deal about it. I&#39;m not
upset."

Sealia tells you, "Heh, no we didn&#39;t. If Dranor had been fuming over it, there 
would have been worse consequences. He would have made it a rule."

Sealia tells you, "Also, I don&#39;t think gods support novice slaughtering."

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "If you truly have an issue 
with it, one death, then take it to the Gods."

Sealia tells you, "You killed everyone who was there. That is more than one 
death."

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "It is one death for each 
person there."

Sealia tells you, "Which tallies to more than one."

Sealia tells you, "I truly don&#39;t have a quarrel with you. It just infuriates me
when people kill my novices."

Sealia tells you, "Don&#39;t kill another person who was at the lament."


You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "I plan on doing so."

You tell Artiste Sealia Rhuidean, Quill of Hope, "If you have an issue, then 
take it to the Gods. I&#39;m done."


You begin to ignore Sealia.
