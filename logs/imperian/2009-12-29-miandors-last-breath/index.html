Genviere Chytovil says to Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee, "The apprentice is on his
way, and Xohln is a bard skilled at his art."
You begin listening closely in order to comprehend foreign tongues. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee nods his head. 
(Kinsarmar): Genviere says, "If anyone else would like to be present, we are 
there now awaiting the delivery of the statue." 
The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "It is a sad day when we erect a 
statue instead of wishing my wife well." 
Stars fill the firmament, illuminating the evening sky with a pale light.
Genviere Chytovil says, "Indeed it is." 
You say, "I agree. I am sorry for your loss, and I thank you, and Limiana, may 
she rest in peace, for both of your sacrifices for us." 
You bow respectfully to Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee. 
The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds. 
An apprentice stonemason pushes a cart into the garden, huffing and puffing as 
he goes. Using his might he slowly dips the cart down until the statue slides 
off the cart and lands in place. 
With a incline of his head, the apprentice pulls the cart out of the garden and
trails back off to the Sanctuary. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee flashes a statue of Limiana, a Lamiran a joyous 
smile. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "A job well done for such a quick 
commission." 
Breathtaking through its detail, this statue is a touching dedication to 
Limiana. Beautiful slabs of granite have been mined from the Vardarian 
Highlands and carefully joined together to form this statue. Sitting on what 
appears to be a carved tree stump, the statue is life size and depicts Limiana 
as being an average-sized Lamira. Gone is the thick robe that the Lamiran wore 
in the later years and it is replaced with a knee-low skirt, chiseled with a 
number of patterns on the surface. Her hair flies back behind her shoulders and
is exquisitely detailed with a lotus hair clip. Her hands rest delicately on 
her knees, as she gazes outwards.
It weighs about 1000 pounds. 
Genviere Chytovil says, "It is quite lovely, a good likeness." 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "It will never look the same as 
the real Limiana, but, I guess it suffices." 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "Now Bard.. Xohln is it?" 
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "Did I get the name wrong?" 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee scratches his head in confusion. 
Genviere lightly taps you, trying to get your attention. 
You nod your acknowledgement of Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee. 
You say, "Xohln, yes, sorry for my absent mind." 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee nods slowly. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "I guess I will tell you my plan. 
As you know the Horde will come for me again eventually. After watching one of 
your Bards on the field, I realise the difficulty it is to first carry off a 
statue, and then to try and kill one.." 
The scent of flowers at night summons thoughts of moonlight romance. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "I guess.. what I&#39;m trying to say 
is.. I want to.." 
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth. 
You say, "I dislike this." 
You say, "A lot." 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee mutters quietly, "This is harder than I thought.". 
A dove comes flying into the room, deposits a letter into Genviere&#39;s hands, 
warbles cheerfully, and flies away. 
Insinyan ripples into existence before you. 
You say to Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee, "This is a very big decision to make.." 
Midnight tolls and a new day comes to the land.
It is the 4th day of Bellum, in the year 597 AD. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "I have had months to think of it.
I accomplish the death of us all if I decide to end my life, and we.. we are 
still at risk." 
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "I gave merit to the ideas of the 
Celidonians. And a statue does not bleed.. They can not kill me while I am 
encased in stone." 
You say to Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee, "If you&#39;ve made up your mind, and the 
Duchess allows..." 
Genviere Chytovil says to Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee, "The decision is yours. 
We will continue to guard you whichever form you take." 
Insinyan inclines his head respectfully. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "I will give you a chance to 
discuss it, but.. I think there is no other way to protect us all. Perhaps one 
day the stone will crack, and I will emerge, or perhaps I will finally die.." 
You say to Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee, "The effect upon others is death." 
You say to Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee, "I wouldn&#39;t assume otherwise for you." 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "Cut your emanation short and I 
will hope that all stops but the faint and slow beating of my heart." 
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth. 
You say, "This is what you wish?" 
You say, "This is torture, Miandor." 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "It is a hope..." 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee shrugs his shoulders as he says, "I can not live my 
life without her.". 
You nod slowly.
You ask, "Do you wish me to cut it short then?" 
You ask, "And attempt to keep you alive, encased in stone?" 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee nods slowly. 
You nod slowly. 
You ask, "Is there anything you&#39;d like to do, or have done before?" 
Genviere Chytovil asks, "Perhaps words you would like to say in Limiana&#39;s 
honour?" 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "I have said them many times 
before, yelled out from the battlements. I am too drained to say anymore." 
Genviere nods slowly. 
You ask Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee, "Shall we begin?" 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "My only request is that you send 
word to the councils that it will be easier on them when I am a statue." 
Genviere closes her eyes for a short moment. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "Perhaps the horde will come for 
me, but let them think I am dead." 
You nod your head. 
Genviere nods slowly. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee says, in Ssylsin, "I am ready." 
You nod your head. 
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee stands on the base of the statue, near the humanoid 
figure of Limiana.
Voice - Kantae

SYNTAX: SING/CHANT KANTAE <target>

Considered to be the most powerful word of power known to mortals, Kantae 
grants the listener a brief moment of the infinite Song of Creation.

Even this solitary note of the song is so powerful that mortal ears are unable 
to comprehend it, nor are they able to hear it safely.

This word is such that one must project one&#39;s voice at the target for an 
extended period of time. Should you not be interrupted while you hold this 
note, and should your target not be deaf at the finish of the word, your target
will be turned to stone.

This word may also not be used in conjunction with any other words of power.
You sing, "Kantae." 
As the first note of &#39;Kantae&#39; is uttered, a chorus of distant ethereal voices 
joins the first to shake the walls around you. 
As you hold your mouth open wide, you force the single word out from your 
entire being, and you feel the very force of the word surround the area. 
You project the word of power to the listening ears of Miandor. 
A stunning songbird begins to sing a trilling song to you. 
You cuts short your emanation of the word of power.

A beatific look of bliss appears on Miandor&#39;s face as his ears begin to harden 
and turn to pure marble. The marble quickly spreads over his face and down his 
neck, turning his entire form white. 
The firmament grows darker as the clouds begin to smother the light. 
You narrow an eye in concentration and hum a few notes.
You relax your mind and will not pay close enough attention to discern foreign 
tongues.
As the stone quickly encompasses his entire form, Miandor reaches out and lays 
a hand on the shoulder of the statue of Limiana. 
After his entire body has been completely transformed, a fine skein of thin 
flame wreathes over the chest of the statue, imprinting a short passage onto 
it.

Crafted from the purest white marble, the statue itself possesses neither seam 
nor chisel-mark, and is a work of absolute genius. Accurate down to the 
smallest detail, one could almost expect it to step from the small plinth it 
stands upon, so perfectly has it been created. Miandor&#39;s hands reach out and 
rest on a nearby statue, his face baring an expression of absolute bliss, eyes 
gazing upward as if looking upon some vision of wonder, almost captured at a 
moment of ascension to a higher plane of existence. A line of elegant script 
has been permanently burned into the chest of the statue.
It weighs about 500 pounds. 
You read what is written on a stunningly life-like statue of Miandor:
Perhaps one day the stone will crack, but, I stand at guard and at rest, 
protecting the half-soul of Krugtha from the world. 
You have emoted: Xohln lowers his head in reverence. 
You nod your acknowledgement of Genviere. 
Genviere nods slowly. 
Genviere Chytovil says, "It is done." 
You suck thoughtfully on your teeth. 
Genviere Chytovil says, "Pray the gods that his pain is not just trapped within
him as well." 
You nod your head. 
You say, "That I hope with all my being.." 
The deep red moon pulsates as it fades slowly into the clouds. 
Genviere Chytovil bows her head in a moment of silent contemplation. 
You say, "I will hunt down the traitors who threw away Limiana&#39;s life." 
Genviere nods her head. 
Kabr&#39;s rays whip around corners and brighten far away landscapes as the day is 
embraced fully by its midmorning warmth. 
You ask Genviere, "Can I do anything else for you, Duchess?" 

(Kinsarmar): Genviere says, "May we all remember the sacrifice Limiana and 
Miandor have given for us." 
Genviere Chytovil says, "Thank you Xohln, that was all." 
You nod your head. 
Genviere nods her head at Syseve politely. 
Genviere takes a rolled scroll from an elegant white letter. 
Elemental Apprentice, Syseve, Pupil of Air says, "They&#39;re beautiful." 
Genviere nods slowly. 
You say, "I think my dreams will be haunted after today :9." 
You cough softly at yourself. 
You frown and say, "I think my dreams will be haunted after today." 
Elemental Apprentice, Syseve, Pupil of Air says, "...That&#39;s ... actually 
Miandor, isn&#39;t it?" 
A bee buzzes past you on its endless quest for pollen. 
You give Syseve a slow nod. 
Genviere Chytovil says to Syseve, "Yes, it is." 
Elemental Apprentice, Syseve, Pupil of Air says, "That explains why I couldn&#39;t 
find him on the wall." 
Syseve gives a pained sigh. 
Genviere Chytovil says, "He thought it better this way." 
Genviere Chytovil says, "Better for him, and for us." 
Syseve nods her head. 
Elemental Apprentice, Syseve, Pupil of Air says, "I&#39;m sure he did. He might 
even be right."
You say, "I&#39;ll take my leave."
You incline your head toward Syseve respectfully.
You bow respectfully to Genviere.
Genviere nods her head at you politely'>You incline your head toward Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee respectfully.
Genviere Chytovil says to Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee, "The apprentice is on his
way, and Xohln is a bard skilled at his art."
You begin listening closely in order to comprehend foreign tongues.
Miandor, a Ssylsin refugee nods his head.
(Kinsarmar): Genviere says, "If anyone else would like to be present, we are
there now awaiting the delivery of the statue."
The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds.

You give Syseve a slow nod.
Genviere Chytovil says to Syseve, "Yes, it is."
Elemental Apprentice, Syseve, Pupil of Air says, "That explains why I couldn't
find him on the wall."
Syseve gives a pained sigh.
Genviere Chytovil says, "He thought it better this way."
Genviere Chytovil says, "Better for him, and for us."
Syseve nods her head.
Elemental Apprentice, Syseve, Pupil of Air says, "I'm sure he did. He might
even be right."
You say, "I'll take my leave."
You incline your head toward Syseve respectfully.
You bow respectfully to Genviere.
Genviere nods her head at you politely</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
