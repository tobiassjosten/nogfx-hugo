Bridge over bubbling brook. (road). (Khandava Council.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. As one steps into this room a bridge is visible passing over a small 
stream, upon which may be heard the babbling brook, and even small fish 
swimming to and fro in the pond. Tiny bushes of miniature roses line the rail 
of the bridge creating a lingering sweet scent, which hangs in the air despite 
the soft breeze that carries the sound of songbirds to the ears. Lying flat on 
the ground is a key-shaped sigil. There are 2 monolith sigils here. An obsidian
eye sigil is here. Its burrowing at an end, a small mole lays dead nearby. The 
ever-shifting visage of Juran, Aspect of Moradeim, is here.

A cul-de-sac at the end of Sycamore Terrace. (Khandava Council.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. This path brings its travelers to be surrounded by private residences 
as it come to an end, the trees growing in a way as to form a natural 
cul-de-sac large enough to hold a large gathering of people. In the center of 
the clearing is a small, natural fresh-water pond, the gentle slashing 
absorbing some of the sounds of the surrounding forest and lending to the 
feeling of tranquility. A large red and brown desert buffalo stands here, claws
instead of hooves digging into the ground with tremendous force. A sigil in the
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A grizzled old rat 
lies here, dead as can be. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in 
the air here. The burnt remnant of someone\'s ear lies on the ground. Little 
more than a stumpy digit, a gnarled finger lies severed from its hand. A small 
black cobra is flaring its hood here. Tiala Elochai is here. She wields a 
spiritual mace in her left hand and a tower shield in her right.

A cul-de-sac at the end of Sycamore Terrace. (Khandava Council.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. This path brings its travelers to be surrounded by private residences 
as it come to an end, the trees growing in a way as to form a natural 
cul-de-sac large enough to hold a large gathering of people. In the center of 
the clearing is a small, natural fresh-water pond, the gentle slashing 
absorbing some of the sounds of the surrounding forest and lending to the 
feeling of tranquility. A large red and brown desert buffalo stands here, claws
instead of hooves digging into the ground with tremendous force. A sigil in the
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A grizzled old rat 
lies here, dead as can be. The burnt remnant of someone\'s ear lies on the 
ground. Little more than a stumpy digit, a gnarled finger lies severed from its
hand. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. The decaying remains of 
Tiala lie here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, west, and northwest.

dead as can be. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air
here. The burnt remnant of someone\'s ear lies on the ground. Little more than a

here. She wields a spiritual mace in her left hand and a tower shield in her

A cul-de-sac at the end of Sycamore Terrace. (Khandava Council.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. This path brings its travelers to be surrounded by private residences
as it come to an end, the trees growing in a way as to form a natural
cul-de-sac large enough to hold a large gathering of people. In the center of
the clearing is a small, natural fresh-water pond, the gentle slashing
absorbing some of the sounds of the surrounding forest and lending to the
feeling of tranquility. A large red and brown desert buffalo stands here, claws
instead of hooves digging into the ground with tremendous force. A sigil in the
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A grizzled old rat
lies here, dead as can be. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in

A cul-de-sac at the end of Sycamore Terrace. (Khandava Council.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant
clouds. This path brings its travelers to be surrounded by private residences
as it come to an end, the trees growing in a way as to form a natural
cul-de-sac large enough to hold a large gathering of people. In the center of
the clearing is a small, natural fresh-water pond, the gentle slashing
absorbing some of the sounds of the surrounding forest and lending to the
feeling of tranquility. A large red and brown desert buffalo stands here, claws
instead of hooves digging into the ground with tremendous force. A sigil in the
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A grizzled old rat
lies here, dead as can be. The burnt remnant of someone\'s ear lies on the
ground. Little more than a stumpy digit, a gnarled finger lies severed from its
hand. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. The decaying remains of
Tiala lie here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, west, and northwest.
