Arvanian accepts your challenge, and you walk through the portal after him,

Next to an ivy-covered wall. (road). (lost) (Southeastern Arena.)
Thick, vibrant ivy has over-grown the whole of the arena wall here, slowly 
adding to the crumbling of the stone as its roots work their way across. Almost
as if a green curtain had been thrown over wall itself, the ivy is a testament 
to the ages that have past since this place was constructed. Tendrils wreath 
the floor with thick vines, threatening to entangle your feet, and there 
appears to be a nest of some sort within the flora, left over from nesting 
years past. You see exits leading north and south.

Forested square. (Southeastern Arena.)
The forest has long taken over this section of the arena, tall trees reaching 
high up into the sky. Towering high above even the tallest trees, the twin 
pillars are visible above the tree line, two final testaments to the mortal 
hands and sweat that went into constructing the might arena. Nature is 
gradually taking it back, however, as is clearly evident by the surrounding 
trees and fauna. You see exits leading north and southeast.

You plant your quarterstaff upright in the dirt, and it is quickly dissolved as
your grove is temporarily moved here.
<318/318h 274/274m 1490e 1272w 32x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You let out a rallying cry, your call for companionship echoing through the 
forest.
With a rush of air, a couatl soars in from the north.
A swarm of bees flies in from the north.
<318/318h 274/274m 1490e 1272w 32x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You breathe life into the forest around you and it begins to stir.

That player is not in the same environment!

You begin the naturewatch.
<318/318h 274/274m 1490e 1270w 32x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You issue a command in the ancient tongue to your grove, and the land murmers

You utter a word of command, calling on your grove to close itself off from the
surrounding world. Immediately the surrounding plantlife begin to writhe, twist
and knot together. Before long a shield of solid undergrowth and earth 
separates you from the rest of the forest, ensconced deep within your grove.

Forested square. (Southeastern Arena.)
The forest has long taken over this section of the arena, tall trees reaching 
high up into the sky. Towering high above even the tallest trees, the twin 
pillars are visible above the tree line, two final testaments to the mortal 
hands and sweat that went into constructing the might arena. Nature is 
gradually taking it back, however, as is clearly evident by the surrounding 
trees and fauna. The area is ablaze! A large beehive hangs down from the trees 
above. A mighty earth golem stands guard here. A silver couatl is coiled here. 
A swarm of bees hovers menacingly nearby. An icewall is here, blocking passage 
to the north. Standing proudly, a forestal portal is here.
You see exits leading north and southeast.

high up into the sky. Towering high above even the tallest trees, the twin
pillars are visible above the tree line, two final testaments to the mortal
hands and sweat that went into constructing the might arena. Nature is
gradually taking it back, however, as is clearly evident by the surrounding
trees and fauna. The area is ablaze! A large beehive hangs down from the trees
above. A mighty earth golem stands guard here. A silver couatl is coiled here.
A swarm of bees hovers menacingly nearby. An icewall is here, blocking passage
