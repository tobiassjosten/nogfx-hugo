Ren glances up from his bleeding palm to Buul with a slow smile.

You say, in Hanyou, "Greetings, Lord Buul."

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Why have you... mere mortals 
called me, Buul, forth?"

You say, in Hanyou, "I have need of your knowledge, chirurgeon. Would you be 
willing to barter with me for it?"

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon turns to Ren with a look of disgust, cocking an eye.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja steps closer to Ren, whispering in his ear as he does so, his eyes focused on the demon lord.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon chuckles soundlessly, his large bulk rocking up and down as he looks down upon Ren.

Leisane whispers to you, in Hanyou, "Be cautious how you word your bargain. 
Remember, do not risk what you are not willing to lose."

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "What have you that I could use, 
mortal?"

You say to Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon, in Hanyou, "Subjects, perhaps, lord. You have need of these things no doubt for your work."

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon stops chuckling, leaning towards Ren as he inspects him closer. A wicked grin creeps across his face as he sniffs the air about the elf.

Ren fixes Buul with his good eye, his face emotionless at the demon&#39;s study of him.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "You&#39;re sorely mistaken, if you 
believe I require any assistance from a mortal. I do not have such weaknesses that you fall to, such gaping holes within your character that you require the assistance of another."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja leans his weight upon his cane, claws digging into the wood, his other hand rubbing at his side as he continues to watch the pair interact.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon spits onto the ground as he leans away from Ren, the liquid evaporating almost instantaneously as it hits the floor.

Sergeant Elphie Fel&#39;Amrit, Diavlous Armourer keeps a close eye on her father 
and Ephor Leisane, waiting for a nonverbal cue to act.

You say, in Hanyou, "I do not believe that is true, Lord Buul. I know there are things you need and perhaps desire."

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon turns from Ren, carefully eying the borders of his entrapment. With his bloodstained claw, he reaches upwards, as if testing the limits of the barrier.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Desire, mortal, is far different than a requirement."

Ren gives a sidelong glance to Leisane before looking back to Buul.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja steps forward slowly, lifting his weight from his cane and placing his clawed hand upon Ren&#39;s shoulder, meeting the gaze of the demon lord.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "Desire and requirement are separate entities, but nor are they mutually exclusive."

You lick your lips.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon snickers quietly as he withdraws his clawed hand 
from the barrier and lightly reaches towards Leisane, yet stops his hand before the edge of the circle.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Ah, Marduk&#39;s pet speaks."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja allows his lips to stay curved in a sardonic smile, the colour in his eyes swirling slowly.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "A pet? Not quite. He would like to think so, but he has not won yet, nor do I intend to let him."

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon chuckles soundlessly once more as he allows his eyes to drift over Leisane&#39;s face, jaw, and neckline.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Some fight, pet, given the state he&#39;s left you in."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles impishly and says, in Hanyou, "And 
which of us is here, and which of us is not, hm? And do recall.. he is not the only one among you who would see me join you."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja steps away from Ren, walking along the lines of the pentagram, until he is just behind Buul&#39;s enclosure.

Ren glances to Leisane.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "We are moving off topic, I think..."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja leans in closer to the enclosure, whispering to the demon lord, his eyes locking upon Ren.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon leans towards Leisane, his face close to the barrier as a grin crosses his terrible countenance.

Ren smirks, glancing back to Buul expectantly.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon raises his brow towards Leisane before turning his bulk to Ren, though mildly paying him any attention.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon fades from view as the power of the pentagram fails.
 
You swear softly to yourself.

Leisane gives a group of 10 red inks to Ryant.

You say, in Hanyou, "Again, please."

Ryant nods his head.

Ryant says, in Hanyou, "Are we all ready?"

You say, in Hanyou, "Yes."

Starlit Ritual Room.
Stepping into this chamber, one witnesses a spectacle of preternatural 
impossibility. Where there should be walls, there is only the vast expanse of black space, studded with brilliant stars which turn and move in and around themselves in a ghostly ballet. The "ceiling" is naught but a silvery vortex, drawing in the stars in smoke-like wisps of light as they near its edge, creating a vacuum of space and time unseen in the mortal realm. Looking down, the floor is crafted of smooth black glass, though it fails to reflect anything whatsoever. Great rings have been carved into its surface, each bearing a small, bright orb at some point along its circumference, with a single, larger orb glowing in the center. With enough searching, one might even find the light representing Aetherius, its three moons arranged in a triangular pattern surrounding it. The air is perfectly still, yet filled with kinetic energy reminiscent of the calm before the storm. It is evident that rituals of great import and terrible power have been practiced here through the years, though an undertone of dread silences questions before they reach the lips. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A huge black metal jackal menaces all who approach with its baleful glare. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A platinum star covered with runes is attached to the door. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Kaeralyse, The Seeker is here. She is holding a tower shield in her left hand. Sergeant Elphie Fel&#39;Amrit, Diavlous Armourer is here. She wields a curved sabre in each hand. Eovai is here. Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja is here. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand and a mithril shield in his right. Ryant is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. He is holding a tower shield in his left hand. Viticus Bathory is here, shrouded. He wields the crystalline staff of the Gazalis in his left hand.
There are no obvious exits.

Ryant raises an eyebrow at Kaeralyse.

Kaeralyse nods her head.

Ryant flashes Kaeralyse a joyous smile.

Ryant nods his head.

Carefully Ryant gathers some ink and begins scrawling a large circle on the 
ground.

Having completed the main circle, Ryant begins to enscribe a large inverted 
star within it.

Sweating from the effort, Ryant begins meticulously writing the sealing runes for the pentagram.

Ryant checks the pentagram one final time for error, before finishing the work.

Kaeralyse, The Seeker chants, in Hanyou, "Dia ad Adaodaun Buul."

As Kaeralyse chants, intense heat fills the room.

Red fire flashes from the pentagram, filling the room with thick smoke. Screams of anguish echo across the stone walls.

You grit your teeth as you slice open your palm, squeezing a fist to permit the thick liquid to drip onto the pentagram and infuse it with power.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja chants, in Hanyou, "Agus Dunach Ort Buul."
As Leisane chants, a portal of fire appears within the pentagram.

Intense heat spews across the room as the portal of fire flashes and Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon emerges from within.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon chuckles loudly, the sound reverberating from his 
gut to fill the entire chamber.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Yet again, your weakness is shown, your great flaws are innumerable."

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon turns towards Ren as he mentions flaws, eying him.

You purse your lips contemplatively.

You say, in Hanyou, "You know what I want, Lord Buul. What is it that you will have of me?"

The sounds of Buul&#39;s laughter suddenly fades as a still quietness overtakes the chamber.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "You, mortal. I will have you."

Ren approaches the barrier with a single stride, his eye fixed upon Buul&#39;s visage.

Ren grits his teeth in a wide grin, leaning in close.

You whisper to Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon, "I have nothing to lose, do I?"

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon leans in once more, staring down Ren.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja walks around the pentagram, his cane&#39;s clack breaking the silence. He steps behind Ren, watching the motions between the two before he reaches forward with is claw, trailing it down the barrier, red sparks flying from the invisible walls as he pushes Ren forward, using his hand to seal the tear behind him, turning his back upon the pair.

His eyes alight with fire, Buul advances towards Ren. With incalculable speed and strength, Buul grabs Ren by the cloak with one hand and throws him against the closer wall.

Ren tries to scrabble back up to his feet, a look of pain crossing his features.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "Remember what I have taught you, Ren. The first rule, hm?"

A grin crosses his features, causing Buul to look slightly crazed yet 
intelligent as he moves towards Ren once more. As he approaches, Buul pulls the elf off of the floor and holds him to the wall with one hand around his neck, his feet dangling inches from the floor. 

Ren wheezes violently, his teeth grit in pain.

You say, in Hanyou, "D-do it!"

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon laughs darkly as he pulls the bloodstained nail 
across Ren&#39;s torso and a sliver of blood appears beneath the Ren&#39;s torn 
clothes. Watching Ren&#39;s face, he repeats the motion several times, creating an object within Ren&#39;s torso that appears similar to the shape of the entrapment.

You say, in Hanyou, "Do-don&#39;t..fu-."

Ren gives a weakened scream, kicking wildly in mid-air.

As the blood begins to pool about Buul&#39;s feet, he clasps his fist and pushes it through Ren&#39;s torso which creates a satisfying, wet smacking noise. For a few moments, Buul keeps his gaze upon Ren&#39;s eyes, his arm disappearing further into Ren&#39;s torso before he removes a faint blue wisp.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja grits his teeth, a momentary look of disgust passing over his features as he listens, turning his head to partially watch.
 
Turning to look at the wisp, disgust crosses over his features as Buul removes an object from within himself and slams it into Ren&#39;s torso with immense force.

Ren stares blankly back at Buul, his head lolling to the side almost lazily.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Weaker than expected mortal. At 
least you&#39;ve provided a few moments of interesting play. I&#39;m sure your 
companions have enjoyed seeing you squeal when you should have stood firm."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja growls under his breath, throwing his cane 
towards Elphie as he steps to the edge of the pentagram, his clawed hand raised in a gesture.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "That is enough, -Lord- Buul. Your pact is now complete."

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon chuckles once more as he turns to Leisane, his hand remaining about Ren&#39;s throat.
 
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Perhaps you&#39;d like to see me have another go at him, pet."
 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja allows his lips to curve into a sardonic 
smirk.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "You forget who controls your time on this plane."

Ren gives a weak gurgling sound, his eye rolling back into its socket.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon catches Leisane&#39;s eye for a few moments before 
grinning wickedly at Ren&#39;s gurgling.

Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon fades from view as the power of the pentagram fails.

Ren collapses to the ground as the hand fades away from his throat, hitting it with a soft thud.
 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja steps over to Ren, pulling him upward by his shirt. He tilts his head, looking over before releasing his grasp, letting him flop onto the ground once more, gesturing towards him.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "Someone, see to him."

Kaeralyse, The Seeker moves quickly to Ren&#39;s side and kneels down looking him over.

Ryant says to Kaeralyse, in Hanyou, "Is there anything I can do m&#39;Lady?"

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja sniffs, finding his cane and taking it back in his grasp, only letting a fleeting glance pass over Ren&#39;s unconscious form.

Leisane touches a platinum star.

Elphie leaves to the ether following Leisane.
They are followed by a black ouroboros.

When touched, the runes etched upon the star begin to emit a soft azure light. As the glow grows brighter and brighter, it encompasses the entirety of the star and a deep scarlet blood begins to seep from the runes, and Leisane is drawn through.

Starlit Ritual Room.
Stepping into this chamber, one witnesses a spectacle of preternatural

A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A huge black metal jackal menaces all who approach with its baleful glare. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A platinum star covered with runes is attached to the door. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Viticus Bathory is here, a blank look in his eyes. He wields the crystalline staff of the Gazalis in his left hand. Kaeralyse, The Seeker is here. She is holding a tower shield in her left hand. Ryant is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. He is holding a tower shield in his left hand. Eovai is here.
There are no obvious exits.

Kaeralyse, The Seeker begins ministering what knowledge of first aid she knows upon Ren.

Kaeralyse, The Seeker says, in Hanyou, "There&#39;s not much I know to do but...."

Viticus Bathory says, "When you two are done tending to him, leave the Chamber, or you&#39;ll be the foundation of my next decoration. Understood?"

Kaeralyse gives Viticus an acknowledging nod.

Ryant says to Viticus, in Hanyou, "Yes, Singularity."

Kaeralyse, The Seeker steps back and begins charging a Priestess tarot which 
she flings upon Ren in hopes to stabilize him.
 
As the stench of blood overtakes the chamber, the flesh of Ren&#39;s torso begins to move on its own accord, slowly knotting itself back together. Fine silver lines remain on his torso, covered by a thick layer of blood.

A faint whisper can be heard as the muscle underneath the flesh begins to 
repair itself, though Ren&#39;s mouth barely moves, "Damaged goods, a shame. I pay better than this."

Kaeralyse, The Seeker stands cautious at hearing the words ready to act as she gestures for the others to leave.

Ryant nods his head.

Ryant says to Kaeralyse, in Hanyou, "Please call on us if you need anything we can fetch it."

Ren draws a slow, ragged breath as his eye flickers open.

Pressing the tips of his fingers one to the other in a steeple at the center of his breast, Ryant bows low in respect.

Ryant touches a platinum star.

Eovai leaves to the ether following Ryant.
When touched, the runes etched upon the star begin to emit a soft azure light. As the glow grows brighter and brighter, it encompasses the entirety of the star and a deep scarlet blood begins to seep from the runes, and Ryant is drawn through.

Pressing the tips of her fingers one to the other in a steeple at the center of her breast, Kaeralyse bows to Viticus in respect.

Kaeralyse touches a platinum star.

Kaeralyse leaves to the ether.
When touched, the runes etched upon the star begin to emit a soft azure light. As the glow grows brighter and brighter, it encompasses the entirety of the star and a deep scarlet blood begins to seep from the runes, and Kaeralyse is drawn through.

Viticus Bathory steps into the center of the chamber, his glance passing over each luminescent orb. Taking his staff firmly into hand, he spins it in the air forming a counter vortex to the one above. Slowly, the light from each of the orbs is drawn in as the present light is absorbed into the crystal of the staff and he slams it into the ground to rest.

Viticus Bathory glances over his "fallen" comrade, his eyes bearing a sort of depression over his dull expression. "Disappointing...", he utters.

Ren rolls over heavily, spitting up a clot of blood as he struggles to stand. Ren&#39;s efforts are marked by a deep, inhuman growl from the back of his throat as the voice of Viticus is raised.

Leisane arrives from the ether.
He is followed by a black ouroboros.
A soft azure light heralds the arrival of Leisane from the ether.

Ren turns to look at Leisane, the corner of his mouth twitching into a smile.

You say, in Hanyou, "It&#39;s.. the pet.. aha.. ha."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Do not make me rip out your throat."

You say, in Hanyou, "And.. harm this little.. apprentice? Ah.. what a rich 
voice he has.. but he is not as strong as I had hoped."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles impishly and says, in Hanyou, "Quite. If he was, you would not find it quite so easy to act through him."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "But perhaps that is the 
difference in willing slavery, and a forced co-existence, hm?"

You say, in Hanyou, "Have no worry, pet. He is... struggling, but he is 
tired..so tired."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "If you continue to call me pet, I will care little for his wishes, and find what little part of you there is in him, and tear it out, even if I must leave him a bleeding husk to do so. Understood?"

You lick your lips.

You say, in Hanyou, "Marduk shows well in you."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "As I said, a forced 
co-existence. I tried and failed, as did he, and now we are stuck with each 
other until one of us proves the stronger."

Ren gives a forced grin, saliva dripping from the corner of his mouth.

Viticus Bathory strokes a finger along the side of the staff&#39;s crystal and it begins to glow with the light of each moon before changing into that of a dark ember.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja asks Viticus, in Hanyou, "Do you wish time 
alone with them?"

Viticus Bathory says to Leisane, "This current audience it required."

Ren gives a sharp cry suddenly, his eye losing focus as he falls heavily to the ground and grasps at his head.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "Mm, transition."

Viticus Bathory says, "Then there won&#39;t be a need for this..."

You say, "W-what do I do.. what do I do.."

Viticus Bathory uproots his staff from the floor, the ember dispersing into 
faint sparks of energy as the light returns to the Chamber&#39;s orbs.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "You grit your teeth, you 
close your mind, and you force him down into the pit he created for himself 
inside you."

Viticus Bathory says, "...Or we will destroy you."

You say, "It&#39;s not working.. it&#39;s n-not.."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "That best not be fear I 
hear, Ren."

As a great spasm wracks Ren&#39;s body, he closes his eyes and clenches his fists over his mouth to stop himself from calling out. Blood lightly flows from his knuckles, where he bit into himself to quiet the screams of anguish.

Leisane whispers something to Viticus.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja shifts his grip on his cane to his left hand, cupping his cheek with the right, tapping a claw-tipped finger against his temple to an unheard rhythm.

Ren stares upwards at Leisane and begins to edge his way toward the door.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles widely, shaking his head as he swiftly walks past Ren, stopping to grab him by the back of his cloak and pulling him upward, turning and wrapping his arm about the other&#39;s shoulder, claws splayed on Ren&#39;s cheek, the tips neatly indenting the flesh.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to you, "And where you are going, hm? 
Trying to leave me so soon?"

Ren gives a strangled cry, but freezes in place.

You mutter, "Can&#39;t run.. .... no.. we&#39;ll .. caught.. he ..n&#39;t le. .. run."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to Viticus, "Give me one reason why I 
shouldn&#39;t finish what was started."

Viticus Bathory says to Leisane, "Because nothing will be learned in way of 
something easily controlled."

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja growls under his breath, lowering his grip to Ren&#39;s throat, letting the tips of his claws prick at the flesh as he whispers in his ear.
 
Leisane whispers to you, "Fear nothing, repeat the litany."

You say, in Hanyou, "He has nothing to lose, yet so much to gain from this. You know it to be true. Ehh.. ehehe."

Viticus Bathory eyes darken fully for a few brief moments as he speaks. "Buul, your need for gifting perfection is the hypocrisy that will lead to your downfall...as greed will lead to another&#39;s." He eyes Leisane as he finishes speaking.

Viticus Bathory says, "I will return shortly, and reprimands will follow."'>Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon glares around the chamber as he scratches his chin with a frighteningly long bloodstained claw.
Ren glances up from his bleeding palm to Buul with a slow smile.
You say, in Hanyou, "Greetings, Lord Buul."
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Why have you... mere mortals
called me, Buul, forth?"
You say, in Hanyou, "I have need of your knowledge, chirurgeon. Would you be
willing to barter with me for it?"
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon turns to Ren with a look of disgust, cocking an eye.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja steps closer to Ren, whispering in his ear as he does so, his eyes focused on the demon lord.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon chuckles soundlessly, his large bulk rocking up and down as he looks down upon Ren.
Leisane whispers to you, in Hanyou, "Be cautious how you word your bargain.
Remember, do not risk what you are not willing to lose."
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "What have you that I could use,
mortal?"
You say to Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon, in Hanyou, "Subjects, perhaps, lord. You have need of these things no doubt for your work."
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon stops chuckling, leaning towards Ren as he inspects him closer. A wicked grin creeps across his face as he sniffs the air about the elf.
Ren fixes Buul with his good eye, his face emotionless at the demon's study of him.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "You're sorely mistaken, if you
believe I require any assistance from a mortal. I do not have such weaknesses that you fall to, such gaping holes within your character that you require the assistance of another."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja leans his weight upon his cane, claws digging into the wood, his other hand rubbing at his side as he continues to watch the pair interact.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon spits onto the ground as he leans away from Ren, the liquid evaporating almost instantaneously as it hits the floor.
Sergeant Elphie Fel'Amrit, Diavlous Armourer keeps a close eye on her father
and Ephor Leisane, waiting for a nonverbal cue to act.
You say, in Hanyou, "I do not believe that is true, Lord Buul. I know there are things you need and perhaps desire."
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon turns from Ren, carefully eying the borders of his entrapment. With his bloodstained claw, he reaches upwards, as if testing the limits of the barrier.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Desire, mortal, is far different than a requirement."
Ren gives a sidelong glance to Leisane before looking back to Buul.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja steps forward slowly, lifting his weight from his cane and placing his clawed hand upon Ren's shoulder, meeting the gaze of the demon lord.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "Desire and requirement are separate entities, but nor are they mutually exclusive."
You lick your lips.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon snickers quietly as he withdraws his clawed hand
from the barrier and lightly reaches towards Leisane, yet stops his hand before the edge of the circle.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Ah, Marduk's pet speaks."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja allows his lips to stay curved in a sardonic smile, the colour in his eyes swirling slowly.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "A pet? Not quite. He would like to think so, but he has not won yet, nor do I intend to let him."
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon chuckles soundlessly once more as he allows his eyes to drift over Leisane's face, jaw, and neckline.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Some fight, pet, given the state he's left you in."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles impishly and says, in Hanyou, "And
which of us is here, and which of us is not, hm? And do recall.. he is not the only one among you who would see me join you."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja steps away from Ren, walking along the lines of the pentagram, until he is just behind Buul's enclosure.
Ren glances to Leisane.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "We are moving off topic, I think..."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja leans in closer to the enclosure, whispering to the demon lord, his eyes locking upon Ren.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon leans towards Leisane, his face close to the barrier as a grin crosses his terrible countenance.
Ren smirks, glancing back to Buul expectantly.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon raises his brow towards Leisane before turning his bulk to Ren, though mildly paying him any attention.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon fades from view as the power of the pentagram fails.
You swear softly to yourself.
Leisane gives a group of 10 red inks to Ryant.
You say, in Hanyou, "Again, please."
Ryant nods his head.
Ryant says, in Hanyou, "Are we all ready?"
You say, in Hanyou, "Yes."
Starlit Ritual Room.
Stepping into this chamber, one witnesses a spectacle of preternatural
impossibility. Where there should be walls, there is only the vast expanse of black space, studded with brilliant stars which turn and move in and around themselves in a ghostly ballet. The "ceiling" is naught but a silvery vortex, drawing in the stars in smoke-like wisps of light as they near its edge, creating a vacuum of space and time unseen in the mortal realm. Looking down, the floor is crafted of smooth black glass, though it fails to reflect anything whatsoever. Great rings have been carved into its surface, each bearing a small, bright orb at some point along its circumference, with a single, larger orb glowing in the center. With enough searching, one might even find the light representing Aetherius, its three moons arranged in a triangular pattern surrounding it. The air is perfectly still, yet filled with kinetic energy reminiscent of the calm before the storm. It is evident that rituals of great import and terrible power have been practiced here through the years, though an undertone of dread silences questions before they reach the lips. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A huge black metal jackal menaces all who approach with its baleful glare. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A platinum star covered with runes is attached to the door. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Kaeralyse, The Seeker is here. She is holding a tower shield in her left hand. Sergeant Elphie Fel'Amrit, Diavlous Armourer is here. She wields a curved sabre in each hand. Eovai is here. Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja is here. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand and a mithril shield in his right. Ryant is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. He is holding a tower shield in his left hand. Viticus Bathory is here, shrouded. He wields the crystalline staff of the Gazalis in his left hand.
There are no obvious exits.
Ryant raises an eyebrow at Kaeralyse.
Kaeralyse nods her head.
Ryant flashes Kaeralyse a joyous smile.
Ryant nods his head.
Carefully Ryant gathers some ink and begins scrawling a large circle on the
ground.
Having completed the main circle, Ryant begins to enscribe a large inverted
star within it.
Sweating from the effort, Ryant begins meticulously writing the sealing runes for the pentagram.
Ryant checks the pentagram one final time for error, before finishing the work.
Kaeralyse, The Seeker chants, in Hanyou, "Dia ad Adaodaun Buul."
As Kaeralyse chants, intense heat fills the room.
Red fire flashes from the pentagram, filling the room with thick smoke. Screams of anguish echo across the stone walls.
You grit your teeth as you slice open your palm, squeezing a fist to permit the thick liquid to drip onto the pentagram and infuse it with power.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja chants, in Hanyou, "Agus Dunach Ort Buul."
As Leisane chants, a portal of fire appears within the pentagram.
Intense heat spews across the room as the portal of fire flashes and Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon emerges from within.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon chuckles loudly, the sound reverberating from his
gut to fill the entire chamber.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Yet again, your weakness is shown, your great flaws are innumerable."
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon turns towards Ren as he mentions flaws, eying him.
You purse your lips contemplatively.
You say, in Hanyou, "You know what I want, Lord Buul. What is it that you will have of me?"
The sounds of Buul's laughter suddenly fades as a still quietness overtakes the chamber.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "You, mortal. I will have you."
Ren approaches the barrier with a single stride, his eye fixed upon Buul's visage.
Ren grits his teeth in a wide grin, leaning in close.
You whisper to Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon, "I have nothing to lose, do I?"
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon leans in once more, staring down Ren.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja walks around the pentagram, his cane's clack breaking the silence. He steps behind Ren, watching the motions between the two before he reaches forward with is claw, trailing it down the barrier, red sparks flying from the invisible walls as he pushes Ren forward, using his hand to seal the tear behind him, turning his back upon the pair.
His eyes alight with fire, Buul advances towards Ren. With incalculable speed and strength, Buul grabs Ren by the cloak with one hand and throws him against the closer wall.
Ren tries to scrabble back up to his feet, a look of pain crossing his features.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "Remember what I have taught you, Ren. The first rule, hm?"
A grin crosses his features, causing Buul to look slightly crazed yet
intelligent as he moves towards Ren once more. As he approaches, Buul pulls the elf off of the floor and holds him to the wall with one hand around his neck, his feet dangling inches from the floor.
Ren wheezes violently, his teeth grit in pain.
You say, in Hanyou, "D-do it!"
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon laughs darkly as he pulls the bloodstained nail
across Ren's torso and a sliver of blood appears beneath the Ren's torn
clothes. Watching Ren's face, he repeats the motion several times, creating an object within Ren's torso that appears similar to the shape of the entrapment.
You say, in Hanyou, "Do-don't..fu-."
Ren gives a weakened scream, kicking wildly in mid-air.
As the blood begins to pool about Buul's feet, he clasps his fist and pushes it through Ren's torso which creates a satisfying, wet smacking noise. For a few moments, Buul keeps his gaze upon Ren's eyes, his arm disappearing further into Ren's torso before he removes a faint blue wisp.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja grits his teeth, a momentary look of disgust passing over his features as he listens, turning his head to partially watch.
Turning to look at the wisp, disgust crosses over his features as Buul removes an object from within himself and slams it into Ren's torso with immense force.
Ren stares blankly back at Buul, his head lolling to the side almost lazily.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Weaker than expected mortal. At
least you've provided a few moments of interesting play. I'm sure your
companions have enjoyed seeing you squeal when you should have stood firm."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja growls under his breath, throwing his cane
towards Elphie as he steps to the edge of the pentagram, his clawed hand raised in a gesture.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "That is enough, -Lord- Buul. Your pact is now complete."
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon chuckles once more as he turns to Leisane, his hand remaining about Ren's throat.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon says, in Hanyou, "Perhaps you'd like to see me have another go at him, pet."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja allows his lips to curve into a sardonic
smirk.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "You forget who controls your time on this plane."
Ren gives a weak gurgling sound, his eye rolling back into its socket.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon catches Leisane's eye for a few moments before
grinning wickedly at Ren's gurgling.
Buul, the Demon Chirurgeon fades from view as the power of the pentagram fails.
Ren collapses to the ground as the hand fades away from his throat, hitting it with a soft thud.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja steps over to Ren, pulling him upward by his shirt. He tilts his head, looking over before releasing his grasp, letting him flop onto the ground once more, gesturing towards him.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "Someone, see to him."
Kaeralyse, The Seeker moves quickly to Ren's side and kneels down looking him over.
Ryant says to Kaeralyse, in Hanyou, "Is there anything I can do m'Lady?"
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja sniffs, finding his cane and taking it back in his grasp, only letting a fleeting glance pass over Ren's unconscious form.
Leisane touches a platinum star.
Elphie leaves to the ether following Leisane.
They are followed by a black ouroboros.
When touched, the runes etched upon the star begin to emit a soft azure light. As the glow grows brighter and brighter, it encompasses the entirety of the star and a deep scarlet blood begins to seep from the runes, and Leisane is drawn through.

He is holding a tower shield in his left hand. Eovai is here.
There are no obvious exits.
Kaeralyse, The Seeker begins ministering what knowledge of first aid she knows upon Ren.
Kaeralyse, The Seeker says, in Hanyou, "There's not much I know to do but...."
Viticus Bathory says, "When you two are done tending to him, leave the Chamber, or you'll be the foundation of my next decoration. Understood?"
Kaeralyse gives Viticus an acknowledging nod.
Ryant says to Viticus, in Hanyou, "Yes, Singularity."
Kaeralyse, The Seeker steps back and begins charging a Priestess tarot which
she flings upon Ren in hopes to stabilize him.
As the stench of blood overtakes the chamber, the flesh of Ren's torso begins to move on its own accord, slowly knotting itself back together. Fine silver lines remain on his torso, covered by a thick layer of blood.
A faint whisper can be heard as the muscle underneath the flesh begins to
repair itself, though Ren's mouth barely moves, "Damaged goods, a shame. I pay better than this."
Kaeralyse, The Seeker stands cautious at hearing the words ready to act as she gestures for the others to leave.
Ryant nods his head.
Ryant says to Kaeralyse, in Hanyou, "Please call on us if you need anything we can fetch it."
Ren draws a slow, ragged breath as his eye flickers open.
Pressing the tips of his fingers one to the other in a steeple at the center of his breast, Ryant bows low in respect.
Ryant touches a platinum star.
Eovai leaves to the ether following Ryant.
When touched, the runes etched upon the star begin to emit a soft azure light. As the glow grows brighter and brighter, it encompasses the entirety of the star and a deep scarlet blood begins to seep from the runes, and Ryant is drawn through.
Pressing the tips of her fingers one to the other in a steeple at the center of her breast, Kaeralyse bows to Viticus in respect.
Kaeralyse touches a platinum star.
Kaeralyse leaves to the ether.
When touched, the runes etched upon the star begin to emit a soft azure light. As the glow grows brighter and brighter, it encompasses the entirety of the star and a deep scarlet blood begins to seep from the runes, and Kaeralyse is drawn through.
Viticus Bathory steps into the center of the chamber, his glance passing over each luminescent orb. Taking his staff firmly into hand, he spins it in the air forming a counter vortex to the one above. Slowly, the light from each of the orbs is drawn in as the present light is absorbed into the crystal of the staff and he slams it into the ground to rest.
Viticus Bathory glances over his "fallen" comrade, his eyes bearing a sort of depression over his dull expression. "Disappointing...", he utters.
Ren rolls over heavily, spitting up a clot of blood as he struggles to stand. Ren's efforts are marked by a deep, inhuman growl from the back of his throat as the voice of Viticus is raised.
Leisane arrives from the ether.
He is followed by a black ouroboros.
A soft azure light heralds the arrival of Leisane from the ether.
Ren turns to look at Leisane, the corner of his mouth twitching into a smile.
You say, in Hanyou, "It's.. the pet.. aha.. ha."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Do not make me rip out your throat."
You say, in Hanyou, "And.. harm this little.. apprentice? Ah.. what a rich
voice he has.. but he is not as strong as I had hoped."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles impishly and says, in Hanyou, "Quite. If he was, you would not find it quite so easy to act through him."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "But perhaps that is the
difference in willing slavery, and a forced co-existence, hm?"
You say, in Hanyou, "Have no worry, pet. He is... struggling, but he is
tired..so tired."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "If you continue to call me pet, I will care little for his wishes, and find what little part of you there is in him, and tear it out, even if I must leave him a bleeding husk to do so. Understood?"
You lick your lips.
You say, in Hanyou, "Marduk shows well in you."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "As I said, a forced
co-existence. I tried and failed, as did he, and now we are stuck with each
other until one of us proves the stronger."
Ren gives a forced grin, saliva dripping from the corner of his mouth.
Viticus Bathory strokes a finger along the side of the staff's crystal and it begins to glow with the light of each moon before changing into that of a dark ember.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja asks Viticus, in Hanyou, "Do you wish time
alone with them?"
Viticus Bathory says to Leisane, "This current audience it required."
Ren gives a sharp cry suddenly, his eye losing focus as he falls heavily to the ground and grasps at his head.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "Mm, transition."
Viticus Bathory says, "Then there won't be a need for this..."
You say, "W-what do I do.. what do I do.."
Viticus Bathory uproots his staff from the floor, the ember dispersing into
faint sparks of energy as the light returns to the Chamber's orbs.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "You grit your teeth, you
close your mind, and you force him down into the pit he created for himself
inside you."
Viticus Bathory says, "...Or we will destroy you."
You say, "It's not working.. it's n-not.."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, in Hanyou, "That best not be fear I
hear, Ren."
As a great spasm wracks Ren's body, he closes his eyes and clenches his fists over his mouth to stop himself from calling out. Blood lightly flows from his knuckles, where he bit into himself to quiet the screams of anguish.
Leisane whispers something to Viticus.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja shifts his grip on his cane to his left hand, cupping his cheek with the right, tapping a claw-tipped finger against his temple to an unheard rhythm.
Ren stares upwards at Leisane and begins to edge his way toward the door.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles widely, shaking his head as he swiftly walks past Ren, stopping to grab him by the back of his cloak and pulling him upward, turning and wrapping his arm about the other's shoulder, claws splayed on Ren's cheek, the tips neatly indenting the flesh.
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to you, "And where you are going, hm?
Trying to leave me so soon?"
Ren gives a strangled cry, but freezes in place.
You mutter, "Can't run.. .... no.. we'll .. caught.. he ..n't le. .. run."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to Viticus, "Give me one reason why I
shouldn't finish what was started."
Viticus Bathory says to Leisane, "Because nothing will be learned in way of
something easily controlled."
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja growls under his breath, lowering his grip to Ren's throat, letting the tips of his claws prick at the flesh as he whispers in his ear.
Leisane whispers to you, "Fear nothing, repeat the litany."
You say, in Hanyou, "He has nothing to lose, yet so much to gain from this. You know it to be true. Ehh.. ehehe."
Viticus Bathory eyes darken fully for a few brief moments as he speaks. "Buul, your need for gifting perfection is the hypocrisy that will lead to your downfall...as greed will lead to another's." He eyes Leisane as he finishes speaking.
Viticus Bathory says, "I will return shortly, and reprimands will follow."</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+4 points with 4 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d12b541790bc9b1383856191fc97bfe3?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by aethus1@xxx on 13 Dec 2008</p>I hate that Sagron forced me to sleep before this happened. :(</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92467a33c20ef4c2d82bb7101089334b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dgroz093@xxx on 14 Dec 2008</p><p>Sif blame me!</p><p>I come on and you&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Hi dude, I haven&rsquo;t slept in 6 weeks and am collapsing on my chair unconscious, what important thing did you have to talk to me about?&rdquo;</p><p>All I had for you was a small new RP direction with another member in the guild so I told you it was cool, could wait and that you should go to sleep.</p><p>Now I get blamed :(</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d12b541790bc9b1383856191fc97bfe3?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by aethus1@xxx on 14 Dec 2008</p>I&rsquo;ll go back to blaming Kira, I suppose. :V</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
