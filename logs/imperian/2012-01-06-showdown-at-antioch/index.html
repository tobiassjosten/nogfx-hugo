Wiliam points accusingly at Sidartha.
   
Wiliam points off into the wild blue yonder.
   
Wiliam points accusingly at Marahdan.
   
Wiliam ponders Marahdan for a moment and says "Hrm..."
   
Marahdan snickers softly to himself.
   
You say to Wiliam, "Our parentsh would be mosht pleashed..."
   
He is an athletic Kohdon. He is rather muscular, with the well-toned legs of 
someone who is used to being in the wilderness, but he&#39;s obviously light on his
feet. He has dark blue, almost black eyes, tan scales, and is of average size 
for his race. Beyond the normal weariness in his eyes is a sense of coldness, 
lending a more reptillian look to them. His tail tends to sway slowly back and 
forth behind him of its own accord. He is wearing an ibex-hide pack, charcoal 
grey trousers, a suit of scale mail, and a bright yellow mask. He holds a 
buckler in each hand.
   
Wiliam says to you, "I like thish one. He has a pleashant chin."
   
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Sidartha.
   
Sidartha rubs some salve on his skin.
   
You nod your acknowledgement of Wiliam.
   
Wiliam stares at Marahdan intently as he approaches him, sucking his thumb 
absently minded. Wiliam stops for a moment, watching Marahdan closely as he 
withdraws his thumb from his mouth and wipes it on Marahdan&#39;s arm.
   
Wiliam steps on Marahdan&#39;s feet and he cups his chin, stroking his own with his
free hand. "Well formed chin, shir." Wiliam comments right before he places a 
quick kiss upon the tip of Marahdan&#39;s nose and steps back, returning to normal 
as if nothing had happened.
   
You say, "Wash jusht going to shay, good eye, Shir."
   
You nod your acknowledgement of Wiliam.
   
You say, "We shall shee."
   
You have emoted: Eugene gives a totally blank stare for several seconds, he 
puts his finger into his mouth briefly, covering his fingertip with saliva.
    
You have recovered balance.
   
You have emoted: Eugene gives Marahdan a eager look, scrunching up his face, 
reaching over with his wet finger and placing it directly into Marahdan&#39;s ear. 
He lingers for a second and then withdraws it, his face returning to normal as 
if nothing had happened.
    
You have recovered balance.
   
Marahdan raises an eyebrow questioningly.
   
You say, "Hmm, yesh, I shee, very deshent."
   
Wiliam says to you, "Will you capture the shimpleton brother? I am far too 
noble to do shuch work."
   
You say to Wiliam, "We need shlave to catch new shlavesh for ush."
   
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh at Wiliam.
   
Wiliam snaps his fingers in front of Sidartha.
   
Wiliam says to Sidartha, "Hey, shimpleton."
   
You say, "Perhapsh we can buy him, a few shovereignsh will do."
   
Wiliam says to Sidartha, "Capture thish shlave for us."
   
Wiliam points accusingly at Marahdan.
   
You say to Sidartha, "Yesh, be hashty."
   
You see Wiliam yell, "Shimpletonsh."
   
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Sidartha.
   
Sidartha rubs some salve on his skin.
   
You say, "He ish far too shimple for that shimple tashk."
   
Wiliam nods his head.
   
Marahdan Ormenthi says, "I do like plays put on for my benefit."
   
Wiliam says, "He ish a vegetable."
   
Marahdan swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.
   
You say, "Hish shimple brain cannot comprehend our wealth."

A masked man says, "I didn&#39;t realize wealth made people stupidly ignorant. 
Simpletons or not, they&#39;re smarter than you."
   
Tajje arrives from the northeast.

Tajje steps through a sewer grate and is gone.
    
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh.
   
Marahdan Ormenthi says, "I am -simply- entertained."
   
You say, "I am more educated well upon your yearsh, more than your shimple 
shlave mind can comprehend."
     
You say, "But no need to worry about ush, we only have more wealth than 10 of 
your shimple lifetimesh."
   
Antioch Shuk.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, northwest, and in.
   
Tajje arrives from the down.
   
Wiliam says to Sidartha, "My father will hear about your blatant ignorance, 
shimpleton. He is the wealthiesht man on Aetheriush, shimpleton. He can 
purchase the protectorate and turn it into a shand box for our expenshive 
kittensh."
   
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh at Wiliam.
   
Wiliam says to Tajje, "Ah, shimpleton."

Tajje&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
   
You say to Tajje, "Greetingsh."
   
Wiliam says to Tajje, "I am shtrangely glad to shee you."
   
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Sidartha.
   
Sidartha rubs some salve on his skin.
   
Wiliam says to Tajje, "You sheem like a helpful shlave."
   
Tajje smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
   
You say to Tajje, "You have been mosht helpful, our parentsh will be pleashed."
   
You say to Tajje, "We will double your rationsh today."
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "...Glad to hear...?"
   
Wiliam says to Tajje, "Capture thish shimpleton for us and tie him to... a 
horshe."
   
Wiliam points accusingly at Marahdan.
   
Tajje raises his hand in greeting to Marahdan and says "Hello!"
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says to Marahdan, "How are you?"
   
You say, "Yesh."
   
Marahdan Ormenthi says to Tajje, "I decide it&#39;s an impromptu play."
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "I can&#39;t just go around tying people to 
horshesh, now."
   
You say to Wiliam, "Hmm, intereshting, I shee."
   
Marahdan Ormenthi says to Tajje, "Only missing popcorn."
   
Marahdan brings corojo to his lips, the rich aroma of smooth tobacco wafting 
through the room as he inhales slowly.
   
Marahdan slowly exhales, creating a train of smoke rings that float lazily into
the air.
   
You have emoted: Eugene gives a totally blank stare for several seconds, he 
puts his finger into his mouth briefly, covering his fingertip with saliva.
    
Wiliam says to a masked man, "Masked shimpleton."
    
You have recovered balance.
   
You have emoted: Eugene gives Marahdan a eager look, scrunching up his face, 
reaching over with his wet finger and placing it directly into Marahdan&#39;s ear. 
He lingers for a second and then withdraws it, his face returning to normal as 
if nothing had happened.
    
You have recovered balance.
   
Tajje peers about himself unscrupulously.
   
Wiliam says to a masked man, "Shtroke my chin. I will reward you will full 
rationsh for today."
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric asks, "So where are you from?"
   
A masked man says, "Renounce grace and I will."
   
Tajje&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement at Wiliam.
   
You say, "Yesh, not nearly ash intelligent ash we thought."
   
Tajje&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement at a masked man.
   
Wiliam says to a masked man, "Shilly shimpleton."
   
Wiliam purses his lips contemplatively.
   
You say, "Hish shtupidity ish reshounding."
   
Aryse arrives from the northeast.
She is followed by a mysterious winged, black tengu.
   
Tajje raises his hand in greeting to Aryse and says "Hi!"
   
Aryse inclines her head respectfully.
   
Tajje whispers quiet words of prayer to the Goddess of Life, and you are 
surrounded by a feeling of well-being.
   
Wiliam says to Marahdan, "How much for you, shimpleton? It sheemsh that we 
cannot find anybody who can capture your shimple body."
   
Tajje&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
   
You say, "We could have him arreshted fashter than he could shtroke our 
chinsh."
   
Aryse blinks.
   
Marahdan Ormenthi says to Aryse, "Wiliam and Eugene are putting on a play, 
apparently."
   
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Sidartha.
   
Sidartha rubs some salve on his skin.
   
Revivalist, Aryse Tyrurdrenn, of the Second Order says, "Is that so?"
   
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh at Marahdan.
   
The bright sun shines down upon you.
   
Wiliam says to Marahdan, "How much?"
   
Nrosthan arrives from the southwest.
   
Nrosthan leaves to the northeast.
   
Aryse ponders the situation.
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "I don&#39;t know. Two naked Tanari walk into 
the Shuk, it sounds like the beginning to a bad joke."
   
Wiliam says to Marahdan, "Gold ish not an isshue. Do not be shy."
   
Marahdan Ormenthi says, "I have no price."
   
You say to Wiliam, "He ish unable to comprehend our wealth."
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric asks, "He&#39;s free?"
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "I&#39;ll take two myself."
   
Wiliam says to Marahdan, "Shilly shimpleton. You wish to be a shlave for free?"
   
Nrosthan arrives from the northeast.
Corpse Eater, the white crow gives Nrosthan the once-over, eyeing him 
suspiciously.
   
Nrosthan leaves to the southwest.
   
You say, "How quaint!"
   
Wiliam says to Marahdan, "Do you have relativesh?"
   
Revivalist, Aryse Tyrurdrenn, of the Second Order says, "It would do you well 
to be decently clothed, lest someone get the wrong idea."
   
Tajje grins mischievously.
   
Wiliam says to Aryse, "Shtroke my chin."
   
The peaceful form of Laia, Aspect of Aryana enters from the northwest.
   
Aryse raises an eyebrow questioningly.
   
Laia, Aspect of Aryana leaves to the in, a feeling of peace leaving with her.
   
Revivalist, Aryse Tyrurdrenn, of the Second Order says, "Excuse me?"
   
You have emoted: Eugene gives a totally blank stare for several seconds, he 
puts his finger into his mouth briefly, covering his fingertip with saliva.
    
Tajje gets some gold sovereigns from an ebon leather backpack.
    
You have recovered balance.
   
You have emoted: Eugene gives Aryse a eager look, scrunching up his face, 
reaching over with his wet finger and placing it directly into Aryse&#39;s ear. He 
lingers for a second and then withdraws it, his face returning to normal as if 
nothing had happened.
    
Tajje buys a pair of white billowing leggings.
    
Tajje buys a pair of white billowing leggings.
    
You have recovered balance.
   
Aryse viciously smacks you about the chops.
   
Tajje gives a pair of white billowing leggings to you.
   
Tajje gives a pair of white billowing leggings to Wiliam.
   
You say, "Don&#39;t hit me, peashant."
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "Put on some pants, for the Gods&#39; sake."
   
"Bah!" Wiliam retorts disgustedly.
   
Aryse narrows her eyes at you in an unnerving manner.
   
You say, "My chopsh are worth more than your shimple life."
   
Wiliam says, "We do not wear clothing made from shuch shimple material."
   
Tajje&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "I see."
   
Revivalist, Aryse Tyrurdrenn, of the Second Order says, "I guess simple is far 
too complicated for their minds to grasp."
   
Aryse shrugs helplessly.
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "I do believe our mortal decorum requires 
you to, though."
   
You say, "Return theshe to the shlavesh that made them for ush."
   
Wiliam says, "Dressh me in gold, shimpleton. Shtroke my chin and shuck my 
toenails."
   
You say, "And tell them we will return for 30 lashingsh."
   
You give a pair of white billowing leggings to Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric.
   
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Sidartha.
   
Sidartha rubs some salve on his skin.
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "Yes master."
   
Aryse raises an eyebrow at Tajje.
   
Tajje steps through a sewer grate and is gone.
   
Wiliam nods his head.
   
You nod your head.
   
Wiliam says, "I like that shimpleton."
   
You say, "We will raishe hish shalary."
   
Tajje arrives from the down.
   
Marahdan Ormenthi says, "What I meant was that I have a purpose that requires 
me to be here. Therefore, I have no price."
   
Johl arrives from the down.
   
Johl leaves to the east.
   
Wiliam says to Tajje, "I like you, shimpleton. What ish your name? I will make 
shure you will receive more gold for your shameful shervicesh."
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "My name is..."
   
Tajje frowns in concentration.
   
You say to Tajje, "You will be well rewarded."
   
Revivalist, Aryse Tyrurdrenn, of the Second Order says to Tajje, "Am I to 
understand that you&#39;ve lost your dignity, Tajje..?"
   
Aryse tilts her head curiously.
   
Tajje blinks rapidly, shaking his head vigorously.
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "What was the question?"
   
Tajje blinks.
   
You say, "What ish your name."
   
You say, "Shimpleton."
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "My name is Tajje."
   
Wiliam says to Aryse, "Shilence shimpleton."
   
Aryse laughs melodically at Wiliam.
   
You say to Aryse, "Shilenshe at onshe."
   
You nod your acknowledgement of Tajje.
   
A masked man says, "Make her."
   
Nrosthan arrives from the southwest.
   
Wiliam says to Tajje, "I will ashk my father to reward you, shimpleton."
   
Tajje&#39;s eyes unfocus for a moment, before he shakes his head vigorously again, 
seemingly coming to his senses.
   
Aryse&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
   
You nod your acknowledgement of Wiliam.
   
Wiliam says to you, "The mashked shimpleton sheemsh to be angry."
   
You say to Tajje, "You have sherved your purposhesh well."
   
Nrosthan touches a mindseye tattoo.
   
You say to Wiliam, "I would be angry too if I were poor."
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "Thank you Master."
   
The peaceful form of Laia, Aspect of Aryana enters from the in.
   
Wiliam says to you, "Wet hish ear."
   
Laia raises an eyebrow questioningly.
   
Laia Ashtear says, "What&#39;s going on?"
   
Aryse frowns in concentration and you see a glazed look momentarily cross 
Tajje&#39;s face.
   
Aryse gives Tajje the once-over, eyeing him suspiciously.
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "I am not playing chess!"
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "Silly Aryse."
   
Aryse frowns in concentration and you see a glazed look momentarily cross 
Tajje&#39;s face.
Tajje leaves to the southwest.
   
Wiliam says to Laia, "Greetingsh shimpleton."

attempting to buy slaves."
   
Tajje arrives from the southwest.
   
Revivalist, Aryse Tyrurdrenn, of the Second Order says, "He has lost his mind."
   
Ariona arrives from the east.
   
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Sidartha.

You say to Laia, "Yesh."
   
Icarius, riding a huge, red-banded desert raptor named Ripley, arrives from the

Aryse&#39;s face.

fantasy."
   
Icarius, riding a huge, red-banded desert raptor named Ripley, leaves to the 
southwest.

Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "Did it wrong?"
   
Laia Ashtear says, "I will ask that the both of you leave the city."
   
Nrosthan leaves to the northeast.
   
Revivalist, Aryse Tyrurdrenn, of the Second Order says to Tajje, "If you would 
stop referring to them as &#39;Master&#39; I wouldn&#39;t have to feel the need to make you
leave the Shuk."
   
Icarius, riding a huge, red-banded desert raptor named Ripley, arrives from the
southwest.
   
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "What? I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking 
about."
   
Wiliam says to Laia, "Follow me to Tuathal. I wish to receive a refund. I am 
not happy with your shervicesh, shimpleton."
   
Aryse raises an eyebrow questioningly.
   
Tajje scratches his head in a confused matter.
   
You say, "And our parentsh will buy thish shimple protectorate and we will shee
you behind barsh for your insholenshe."
   
Johl arrives from the down.
   
Johl leaves to the southwest.
   
Laia Ashtear says, "This is your last chance to leave before I enemy the both 
of you."
   
You say to Wiliam, "How quaint, they cannot comprehend our wealth."
   
Wiliam says to Laia, "How quaint! Why would you enemy me?"
   
Revivalist, Aryse Tyrurdrenn, of the Second Order says to a masked man, "What 
patience I have for these... fools is wearing thin."
   
You have emoted: Eugene gives a totally blank stare for several seconds, he 
puts his finger into his mouth briefly, covering his fingertip with saliva.
    
You have recovered balance.
A masked man nods his head.
   
You have emoted: Eugene gives a masked man a eager look, scrunching up his 
face, reaching over with his wet finger and placing it directly into a masked

You have been slain by an elite Justicar of the Shah. (all)

Wiliam has been slain by an elite Justicar of the Shah.

You say, "Shimpletonsh."

If you are unsure what to do, read HELP DEATH for more information.

Overcome by death, Wiliam&#39;s spirit fades to grey.

Your consciousness shifts, and you feel your body no more.

You feel a moment of disorientation, followed by a sensation of floating upward
as if you had no weight.

Looking about yourself, you notice that you have in fact risen a few feet above
the ground, and in a terrifying revelation you see your body lying twisted and 
broken before you.

After gazing a moment in horror, you notice the color and vibrancy around you 
begins to fade. As the brightness of your surroundings melt into a dismal gray,
you hear a faint and yet high-pitched droning sound.

The droning noise increases in intensity, and within seconds the sound becomes 
a deafening cacophony resembling a thousand voices wailing in agony.

Calling upon the Goddess of Life, Tajje gathers your broken corpse into his 
arms and embraces it gently.
You are pulled back from the brink of eternity and open your eyes among the 
living once more.
Fringes of the desert nearing grasslands.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.
  
Calling upon the Goddess of Life, Tajje gathers the broken corpse of Wiliam 
into his arms and embraces it gently.
Wiliam rises with new life, his wounds miraculously closing up before your 
eyes.
  
Tajje blinks.
  
Wiliam says, "To tajjil Good shimpleton!"
  
You say to Tajje, "Thank you very muchh."
  
Wiliam coughs softly.
  
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh at Wiliam.
  
Wiliam says to Tajje, "Well done, shimpleton."
  
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "Anytime Masters."
  
With a flourish of his arm, Tajje bows deeply.
  
You say, "Perhapsh their shimplishity hash infected your brain."
  
Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric says, "Well, you&#39;re enemies now."
  
Tajje waves goodbye.
  
You nod your head.
  
Tajje leaves to the northeast.
  
You tell Pious Tajje, Initiate Cleric, "Yesh, we are aware, our parentsh will 
hear about thish insholenshe."
  
(Ring): Wiliam says, "You tell Laia Ashtear, "My parentsh will hear about 
thish. You will work in my uncle&#39;sh harem for the resht of your shimple life. 
You will be shared by my uncle to hish busshinesh asshociatesh.""

He is an athletic Kohdon. He is rather muscular, with the well-toned legs of
someone who is used to being in the wilderness, but he's obviously light on his
feet. He has dark blue, almost black eyes, tan scales, and is of average size
for his race. Beyond the normal weariness in his eyes is a sense of coldness,
lending a more reptillian look to them. His tail tends to sway slowly back and
forth behind him of its own accord. He is wearing an ibex-hide pack, charcoal
grey trousers, a suit of scale mail, and a bright yellow mask. He holds a
buckler in each hand.

free hand. "Well formed chin, shir." Wiliam comments right before he places a
