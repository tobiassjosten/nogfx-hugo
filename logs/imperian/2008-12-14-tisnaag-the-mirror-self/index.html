The Malkavian Mystique. (City of Stavenn.)
A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. Cacophonies of cackling laughter fill the air swirling around a shrine honoring Malkav. Standing approximately five feet tall, it flows methodically into the image of the masks of Comedy and Tragedy. A shimmering unicursal hexagram, spins ever slowly over the top. His powerful form dominating the area, this impressive buckskin stallion stands with an air of confidence about him. Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. Like a promise of comfort, a sofa covered in fine ruby red silk is positioned here, ebon suede pillows adding a taste of sophistication. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Marked with distinguishing white and black fur, a large panda bear is here munching lazily on a bamboo stalk. Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien is here. He wields the crystalline staff of the Gazalis in his left hand. Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien is here.You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading west (open door) and down (closed door).

You incline your head respectfully.

Viticus nods his head at you politely.

... idle chatter ...

Viticus beckons you to him.

You begin to follow Viticus.

... walking ...

A solemn foyer.
Dark panels of burnished cherry adorn the walls of this solemn hall, lending a dark aura to its rather somber atmosphere. The sills of stained-glass windows have been lined in an array of soft, white candles, their flickering light cast upon twin images. The Bathory crest ensconces one wall; an intricate heart and diamond rendered in sanguine hues adorn the lower curve, silver-rimmed and each level to the other. Above these resides a stygian club, its dark surface gleaming in the limited light. The focal point of the design is an ornate sigil, the Ace of Spades ensconced in atramentous hues; its shadowed surface etched in the infernal dialect of the Demon Lords. Grim upon the opposite window, another array of stained glass depicts the crest of the Roke clan - panes of blackened glass whose dark surface is interrupted by the image of a skeletal hand, its translucent contours striated in whorls of silver. Enscripted below the crest in fragile silver, fine elven hand reads: - Both kings and paupers die the same. The hand that rules is broken; and chaos is her name. - The floor has created of rich, smooth wood; not disimilar to the remainder of the room, while an integration of both crests adorns its dark surface - wherein the hand of Roke upholds the Black Spade of Bathory. Screens of rice paper allow an entrance to the villa proper, able to be opened or closed with a seamless ease. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien is here. He wields the crystalline staff of the Gazalis in his left hand. Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien is here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, southeast (closed door), and northwest.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Pardon the lack of furniture...this is my home."

You say, "Quite all right. I am accustomed to sparse living."

Viticus drops a chocolate covered maggot.

Viticus drops a platter of coconut shrimp.

Viticus drops a warm butterscotch biscuit.

Viticus drops a small plate of deviled eggs.

Viticus drops a steaming mug of spiced wine.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Help yourself to whatever."

You say, "Thank you."

You pick up a chocolate covered maggot.

Pondering the little morsel in your hand, you lift a chocolate covered maggot to your mouth and bite it in half.

Viticus takes a sleeveless black robe from a silk pouch strewn with sapphires.

You fight back your gag reflex as the sour maggot juices roll over your tongue.

You put the rest of the concoction in your mouth and smile slightly as you finally taste the sweet milk chocolate coating.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien takes both of his robes, folding them neatly into a square as he places them onto the ground.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien settles his staff into the corner of a wall, before returning to one of his folded robes as he takes a seat and glances over the food remaining.

You have emoted: Miana tilts her head from one side to another as attempts to force away the sour taste of maggot from her memory.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "I hope you&#39;re not accustomed to standing in homes, either."

Viticus picks up a platter of coconut shrimp.

You have emoted: Miana purses her lips slightly before settling onto the ground, curling one leg underneath her and keeping the other slightly bent as if staying prepared to stand in a rush.

You sit yourself down.

Viticus nods his head.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Even with your lack of time spent awake, what have you learned since we last spoke?"

You have emoted: Miana tilts her head slowly to one side then the other, the joints in her neck cracking loudly.

You say, "Perhaps nothing new, but a reiteration of old knowledge -- that  nothing comes without work and the determination of one&#39;s self, one&#39;s own  strength."

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien forks a piece of shrimp off his platter gracefully into his mouth, finishing his bite before he speaks.  "You are determined to do this alone, then?".

You have emoted: Miana rests her plate of grilled Lamira fillet on her knee, picking at it with her fingers. "Is it ever safe to rely on a mortal for help? To help fires grow that they absolutely cannot understand? To offer to little or too much oxygen. Only the knowledge of one&#39;s own self, the intricate balance with the power inside of him or her, can create a basis for power and resplendence".

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien produces to pristine napkin cloths from his pouch, placing one before you before he attends to his mouth with a smooth wipe. He helps himself to the rest of the platter, closing his eyes in concentration.

Viticus eats a platter of coconut shrimp with obvious gusto.

Gazing down at your plate hungrily, you begin to devour a grilled Lamira fillet.

The taste of lemon tantalizes your taste buds as you chew on the succulent Lamira fillet before moving onto the garlic smashed potatoes.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "A basis, yes. Trascendence requires something more...what if I could offer you something that would ensure you never had to look to another mortal being for any and all of your desires?"

You have emoted: Miana takes the napkin before her, wiping off her fingers before dabbing her mouth. She continues to hold the napkin in her hand.

You say to Viticus, "And what would such an offer entail?"

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien stares intently into your eyes, his own slowly swirling with a clouding darkness as he speaks. "Are the details more important than obtaining what you seek?".

You have emoted: Miana quirks an eyebrow, shifting her position slightly, her cool green eyes locked onto yours. "I sought Stavenn and the Empire&#39;s dark arts for a reason, because the details behind such glory were minute and dismissible. It was the end product, the strength, that mattered, and will matter to conquer the weak and destroy those unworthy to bask in the presence of the true Divine." She pauses a moment to roll her shoulders, the joints around her spine audibly cracking. "Thus, no, the details are not more important than what I seek. But the promise and stability of it is." She continues to hold your gaze, curiosity piqued by the clouding darkness.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien takes a sip from his mug, nodding as his eyes return to their normal state. "And so I thought such was the only thing that would matter in this case. There is no need to question what the offer entails, the offer will remain solid as it is spoken." He drops his shoulders loosely, his posture becoming more inviting in the relaxation of his body, though his eyes begin to stir shrouds again. "But you must prove to me you&#39;re only concerned about the end product before I will gift you with it.".

You have emoted: Miana idly cracks her knuckles, a calm resolve masking her features while the same determination flickers in her eyes. "What must I do?" she asks, her voice even and slow, despite the hunger dripping from her words.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien grins, thought the visage appears to be a shadowed mask over his face bearing rows of demonic fangs. A cold wind stirs through the room, and he begins to produce a group of items from his holding.

Viticus gives six Soul Stealers to you.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Intoxication - the ultimate loss of self, control, and full giving of trust to everything and nothing. Will you consume them in blind faith of me?"

You have emoted: Miana traces the rim of one of the glasses with her forefinger. Her eyes ponder the contents before darting up back to your face, enchanted more than intimidated by the demonic visage masking your features. "I will," she states simply yet firmly.

You have emoted: Miana lifts the first glass to her lips, tilting it back as she begins to drink.

You drain the last drops of vodka from a Soul Stealer.
You take a deep breath before emptying the glass into your awaiting mouth. Almost instantly, you lose your breath and shiver as you feel your entire body become cold as a corpse.

With a hiccup you regain your breath, your lips parting as the last vestiges of
freezing fog leave you.

You drop a Soul Stealer.
As the shot glass hits the ground it dissolves into a fine mist.

You have emoted: Miana closes her eyes, breathing in the fine mist that has gathered around her from the glasses.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien straightens his back slightly, his amusement masked as he observes your state.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says to you, "How do you feel?"

You say, "Far from intooxicated, as such wbsh your aim."

You cough softly.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien smiles impishly and says, "My aim?"

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "We&#39;ve yet to discover my aim...wait here."

A swirling portal opens from the Demon Planes and spits out a pathfinder, then vanishes.

Viticus unlocks the southeast door.

Viticus opens the door to the southeast.

Viticus leaves to the southeast.
He is followed by Viticus and a pathfinder.

The door to the southeast closes abruptly.

You hear the door to the southeast being locked.

Viticus arrives from seemingly out of nowhere, being led by a pathfinder demon entity.
He is followed by Viticus and a pathfinder.

Viticus gives five double shot glass to you.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Take that, cautiously. I don&#39;t want you mindless and in a heap."

You have emoted: Miana smiles wickedly as the forcefully taps the rim of the first glass with her daegger, causing the glass to split. She throws it down, feeling the alcohol burn her throat, mixing with blood as the glass cuts her lip.

You gulp down whiskey, wetting your palate.

You have emoted: Miana licks away the blood on her lips.

You tilt your head back and slam the whiskey, squinting your eyes as it burns its way down your throat.

You drop a double shot glass.

Viticus purses his lips contemplatively.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says to you, "And now how do you feel?"

You say, "Warmu Relaxcd."

You say, "Ddrphnk."

You fumble about drunkenly.

You say, "Ddguhnk."

You purse your lips contemplatively.

You have emoted: Miana shakes her head at herself, refusing to become frustrated with her stumbling, fumbling actions and slurred speech.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien nods slowly, a hand reaching out in a beconing gesture. "Come forth..." a cold and hollow voice resonates within the foyer.

You have emoted: Miana shifts curiously, setting the rest of the glasses on the ground. She cants her head curiously to one side, staring into the darkness of the foyer.

You have emoted: Miana turns to you, raising an eyebrow questioningly.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien stands up, his body merely inches from yours as his eyes pierce into yours sharply with a void passion. Meanwhile, his hands produce an inking vial and quill from his pouch.

You have emoted: Miana pushes to her feet, slowly, her eyes wandering to the inking vial and quill in your hands.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien places his quill into the vial, inking it in what appears to be a white and pasty liquid. He places the vial down, once the tip is well enough coated and proceeds to wielding his sabre. A hand wraps around your side, pulling you against him as he cuts through the center of your shirt.

You have emoted: Miana clenches her jaws, summoning up the will to resist reflexes to fight back. Her eyes struggle to focus on yours, her movements sluggish.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Good..."

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien pulls down the rest of your shirt so that your upper back and collar bone are exposed. Without thought or hesitation, he quickly steps behind you, wrapping a tight arm around your throat and another around your waist to hold you to his will. "Are you ready torecieve what you desire?".

You have emoted: Miana tenses at your movements but responds without hesitation, "Yes." She stares into the darkness, her eyes losing focus with nothing on which to focus.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien slowly removes his vices upon you, his hands gently caressing your skin with a cold touch that strangely warms your blood as he does so. The quill passes before your eyesight and it begins to look like the light of Moradeim, while he chants breathlessly behind you. Suddenly, rapid stabbing is applied to your back in strict patterns.

You have emoted: Miana clenches her hands into fists, gritting her teeth as she grows accustomed to the pain. Her eyes stay open, becoming more and more focused on the darkness as the feeling of fire burns across her back with the inking process.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien finishes the initial process with a fluorish, as he completes inking a pentagram woven with three equidistant circles between your shoulder blades. He then moves to turn your body, caressing your sides again as he does so. He starts to ink over your collar bone, yelling out demonic incantations. His eyes fade completely to black as the ritual moves along, and the crystal of his staff in the background emits a red glow into the foyer.

You have emoted: Miana resists the urge to roll her shoulders, to ease the itch the burning has caused. Her eyes shift to the shadows cast along the wall by the staff&#39;s red glow as she hears your own chants grow louder and louder into shouts. There is only silence in her mind, an eerie calm.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien finishing the inking and becomes still, his eyes fixed on yours though he continues with the incantations. The words begin to seamlessly blend together and the last audible phrase to leave his lips is "Agus dunach ort Tis&#39;Naag." Viticus lifts an imperial finger to strike the fresh inkings on your body and you feel an overwhelming force burst through your being, threatening to blow your heart out.

You have emoted: Miana freezes in place, reflexes unsure of whether to stumble forwards or backwards as her mind interprets the force that hit her. She bites down onto her lip to keep from screaming, blood drawing as she cuts into the flesh with her teeth as the pain engulfs her entire being.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien backs away slowly, keeping his attention fixed on his subject as he watches her wish unfold. The force within your body escalates in pressure and you feel a thick substance wrenching your soul from the inside.

You have emoted: Miana twists her head from side to side as she tries to understand what is happening. She struggles to breath, feeling as if her body might implode or explode, the exhaustion of the pain beginning to settle in. Her cold eyes darken to a deep shade of green, almost black, as they lock onto you, a fearsome rage overcoming her features.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien plants his sabre into the ground, prepared to react though his attention still seems focused on the reactions occuring within you. The vice upon your soul tightens until you feel your soul twisting and rearranging itself from the inside out. "This is only the beginning, Miana. Fear Me not...".

You have emoted: Miana closes her eyes, relaxing her body as she ceases to fight the changes. Her fists and jaws unclench. Her eyelids snap open, her gaze cold and piercing as she watches you curiously. "Fear Me not," she repeats monotonically.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien reapproaches you with ease, moving to stand behind you as he wraps his arm around your waist once more. His right hand moves to stroke through of few strands of your hair as he continues to speak.

Viticus whispers to you, "Tis&#39;Naag, the Mirror Self. That which is born with you, your soul, since the dawn of Creation. Your Tis&#39;Naag has waited many eons within the Demonic Planes for Its chance."

You whisper to Viticus, "And now It has it."

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien whispers "Indeed," as he reaches out with his right hand to grab your own wielding the daegger. "But It cannot manifest completely until you die. Your soul will be trapped on the other side where Its fate was once sealed. Only your mind will remain..." As his last statement is made, the words hang in your ear. His hand guides yours and your daegger deep into your heart, holding it and you as you bleed out.

You have emoted: Miana nods subtly as she watches you guide her own daegger towards her. Her face twists with pain for but a moment as the daegger plunges through her heart, the warm blood spilling out over her hand and yours and onto the floor as she exsanguinates. She feels her body grow weaker and weaker, leaning more into you as she can no longer stand. Her eyes close as the last bit of life ebbs from her body.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien lifts you up into his arms, carrying you towards the Bathory crest on the wall. He kneels before the crest, resting your body over his knee as he removes the daegger. He then in turn slices his own palm to complete the cycle of activation, leaving you to the resurrection of your Tis&#39;Naag.

You have emoted: Miana begins to twitch as her body begins to reawake. The temperature of her skin begins to rise to a degree far from normal for a human. The blood staining her chest begins to sizzle and melt into the skin, sealing the wound in the process and leaving the flesh over her heart raised, scarred. Her left hand slowly lifts into the air, the daegger tearing itself from your hand to return to hers. Her eyelids snap open with a start, her eyes holding a wicked obsidian tint as she slowly sits up.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien tenses slightly, though he retains his demeanor as he watches you rise anew. His eyes begin to swirl with curiosity and he stands up straight as he prepares to encounter your new self.

You have emoted: Miana pushes to her feet with an eerie grace. Her demeanor is cold, and the air seems suffocatingly still in the room. "How different..." she says with an amused curiosity. Her head tilts to one side before straightening as she turns to cast a glance over her shoulder, studying the Bathory crest behind her. "How curious..." She turns to face the crest, tracing its markings with the middle and ring fingers of her right hand. "To feel so strong, so oddly calm with a rage sweltering inside of me." In a swift movement, she steps towards you, her daegger pressed against your throat. She leans closer towards you, keeping the blade to your flesh, as she whispers in your ear, "Thank you for releasing me." Her breath is cool. She takes two quick steps backwards, watching you. The green of her eyes is slowly returning.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien remains frozen in place as he watches your actions, his limbs heavy with a quiver bolting through the muscles of his body. He reapproaches you however, his curiosity of the event taking over his priority as a latent shiver falls over his body.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Is thanks enough, one may wonder."

You have emoted: Miana takes a step closer to you once more. "Is it enough?" she asks curiously, and though her words nor tone seem threatening, her eyes flicker something fierce, dangerous.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien reaches out to grab your chin, pulling your face within an inch of his own as he studies your eyes. "The answers must not come so easily, or you will never learn to control the gift. You are doomed if you cannot even must the power to determine what I want, let alone others."

Viticus whispers to you, "Desire is the fatal weakness of mortals. I have turned yours into strength."

You have emoted: Miana turns her head to pull her chin from your grasp. She stands her ground, turning back to meet your gaze. "What is it that you want?" she asks coolly.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien reaches his right arm out, summoning his staff to his grasp. He sidesteps you and then turns his body far enough to lean against the wall as he closes his eyes.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "I will not tell you, because it will be the challenge that gives rise to your potential. However..."

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "The threads of Fate are not only tied to us, one and all, but a many of things. There is a path to follow, and there are two ends to each."

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "You have but two years to discover what I want. Should you succeed, all that you have ever desired will be at your command and uninhibited."

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "But should you fail..."

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien opens his eyes, the orbs swamped into darkness once more. The colour seems more fluid and lively than before, and becomes apparent of its true nature as it begins to seep out of his eyes and surround the outlines of his form. His voice reaches well into your hearing, echoing in your mind though his lips do not move and you hear him speak "Or you and your blood to follow will become a servant of My House."

You have emoted: Miana immediately takes a step back, recognizing she stands in the presence of something far greater than she. She bows her head in respect. "I understand," she states quickly, her cool tone fading in intimidation.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien raises a palm to his face, covering it as he leans his head back with a slight groan. As his face comes down, he appears to be as normal as he was when you first met. He nods aimlessly as he beckons you to him.

Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "We shall have to...engage another time."

You incline your head toward Viticus respectfully.'>Viticus tells you, "What are you currently doing?"
You tell Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien, "Nothing, at the moment. Is there something I can do for you, sir?"
Viticus tells you, "I wish to continue our conversation about your quest."
You tell Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien, "Very well."
The Malkavian Mystique. (City of Stavenn.)
A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. Cacophonies of cackling laughter fill the air swirling around a shrine honoring Malkav. Standing approximately five feet tall, it flows methodically into the image of the masks of Comedy and Tragedy. A shimmering unicursal hexagram, spins ever slowly over the top. His powerful form dominating the area, this impressive buckskin stallion stands with an air of confidence about him. Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. Like a promise of comfort, a sofa covered in fine ruby red silk is positioned here, ebon suede pillows adding a taste of sophistication. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Marked with distinguishing white and black fur, a large panda bear is here munching lazily on a bamboo stalk. Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien is here. He wields the crystalline staff of the Gazalis in his left hand. Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien is here.You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading west (open door) and down (closed door).
You incline your head respectfully.
Viticus nods his head at you politely.
... idle chatter ...
Viticus beckons you to him.
You begin to follow Viticus.
... walking ...
A solemn foyer.
Dark panels of burnished cherry adorn the walls of this solemn hall, lending a dark aura to its rather somber atmosphere. The sills of stained-glass windows have been lined in an array of soft, white candles, their flickering light cast upon twin images. The Bathory crest ensconces one wall; an intricate heart and diamond rendered in sanguine hues adorn the lower curve, silver-rimmed and each level to the other. Above these resides a stygian club, its dark surface gleaming in the limited light. The focal point of the design is an ornate sigil, the Ace of Spades ensconced in atramentous hues; its shadowed surface etched in the infernal dialect of the Demon Lords. Grim upon the opposite window, another array of stained glass depicts the crest of the Roke clan - panes of blackened glass whose dark surface is interrupted by the image of a skeletal hand, its translucent contours striated in whorls of silver. Enscripted below the crest in fragile silver, fine elven hand reads: - Both kings and paupers die the same. The hand that rules is broken; and chaos is her name. - The floor has created of rich, smooth wood; not disimilar to the remainder of the room, while an integration of both crests adorns its dark surface - wherein the hand of Roke upholds the Black Spade of Bathory. Screens of rice paper allow an entrance to the villa proper, able to be opened or closed with a seamless ease. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien is here. He wields the crystalline staff of the Gazalis in his left hand. Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien is here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, southeast (closed door), and northwest.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Pardon the lack of furniture...this is my home."
You say, "Quite all right. I am accustomed to sparse living."
Viticus drops a chocolate covered maggot.

Viticus drops a frosty black cherry sorbet.
Viticus drops a platter of coconut shrimp.
Viticus drops a warm butterscotch biscuit.
Viticus drops a small plate of deviled eggs.
Viticus drops a steaming mug of spiced wine.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Help yourself to whatever."
You say, "Thank you."
You pick up a chocolate covered maggot.
Pondering the little morsel in your hand, you lift a chocolate covered maggot to your mouth and bite it in half.
Viticus takes a sleeveless black robe from a silk pouch strewn with sapphires.
You fight back your gag reflex as the sour maggot juices roll over your tongue.
You put the rest of the concoction in your mouth and smile slightly as you finally taste the sweet milk chocolate coating.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien takes both of his robes, folding them neatly into a square as he places them onto the ground.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien settles his staff into the corner of a wall, before returning to one of his folded robes as he takes a seat and glances over the food remaining.
You have emoted: Miana tilts her head from one side to another as attempts to force away the sour taste of maggot from her memory.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "I hope you're not accustomed to standing in homes, either."
Viticus picks up a platter of coconut shrimp.
You have emoted: Miana purses her lips slightly before settling onto the ground, curling one leg underneath her and keeping the other slightly bent as if staying prepared to stand in a rush.
You sit yourself down.
Viticus nods his head.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Even with your lack of time spent awake, what have you learned since we last spoke?"
You have emoted: Miana tilts her head slowly to one side then the other, the joints in her neck cracking loudly.
You say, "Perhaps nothing new, but a reiteration of old knowledge -- that nothing comes without work and the determination of one's self, one's own strength."
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien forks a piece of shrimp off his platter gracefully into his mouth, finishing his bite before he speaks. "You are determined to do this alone, then?".
You have emoted: Miana rests her plate of grilled Lamira fillet on her knee, picking at it with her fingers. "Is it ever safe to rely on a mortal for help? To help fires grow that they absolutely cannot understand? To offer to little or too much oxygen. Only the knowledge of one's own self, the intricate balance with the power inside of him or her, can create a basis for power and resplendence".
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien produces to pristine napkin cloths from his pouch, placing one before you before he attends to his mouth with a smooth wipe. He helps himself to the rest of the platter, closing his eyes in concentration.
Viticus eats a platter of coconut shrimp with obvious gusto.
Gazing down at your plate hungrily, you begin to devour a grilled Lamira fillet.
The taste of lemon tantalizes your taste buds as you chew on the succulent Lamira fillet before moving onto the garlic smashed potatoes.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "A basis, yes. Trascendence requires something more...what if I could offer you something that would ensure you never had to look to another mortal being for any and all of your desires?"
You have emoted: Miana takes the napkin before her, wiping off her fingers before dabbing her mouth. She continues to hold the napkin in her hand.
You say to Viticus, "And what would such an offer entail?"
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien stares intently into your eyes, his own slowly swirling with a clouding darkness as he speaks. "Are the details more important than obtaining what you seek?".
You have emoted: Miana quirks an eyebrow, shifting her position slightly, her cool green eyes locked onto yours. "I sought Stavenn and the Empire's dark arts for a reason, because the details behind such glory were minute and dismissible. It was the end product, the strength, that mattered, and will matter to conquer the weak and destroy those unworthy to bask in the presence of the true Divine." She pauses a moment to roll her shoulders, the joints around her spine audibly cracking. "Thus, no, the details are not more important than what I seek. But the promise and stability of it is." She continues to hold your gaze, curiosity piqued by the clouding darkness.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien takes a sip from his mug, nodding as his eyes return to their normal state. "And so I thought such was the only thing that would matter in this case. There is no need to question what the offer entails, the offer will remain solid as it is spoken." He drops his shoulders loosely, his posture becoming more inviting in the relaxation of his body, though his eyes begin to stir shrouds again. "But you must prove to me you're only concerned about the end product before I will gift you with it.".
You have emoted: Miana idly cracks her knuckles, a calm resolve masking her features while the same determination flickers in her eyes. "What must I do?" she asks, her voice even and slow, despite the hunger dripping from her words.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien grins, thought the visage appears to be a shadowed mask over his face bearing rows of demonic fangs. A cold wind stirs through the room, and he begins to produce a group of items from his holding.
Viticus gives six Soul Stealers to you.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Intoxication - the ultimate loss of self, control, and full giving of trust to everything and nothing. Will you consume them in blind faith of me?"
You have emoted: Miana traces the rim of one of the glasses with her forefinger. Her eyes ponder the contents before darting up back to your face, enchanted more than intimidated by the demonic visage masking your features. "I will," she states simply yet firmly.
You have emoted: Miana lifts the first glass to her lips, tilting it back as she begins to drink.
You drain the last drops of vodka from a Soul Stealer.
You take a deep breath before emptying the glass into your awaiting mouth. Almost instantly, you lose your breath and shiver as you feel your entire body become cold as a corpse.
With a hiccup you regain your breath, your lips parting as the last vestiges of
freezing fog leave you.
You drop a Soul Stealer.
As the shot glass hits the ground it dissolves into a fine mist.

You have emoted: Miana closes her eyes, breathing in the fine mist that has gathered around her from the glasses.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien straightens his back slightly, his amusement masked as he observes your state.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says to you, "How do you feel?"
You say, "Far from intooxicated, as such wbsh your aim."
You cough softly.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien smiles impishly and says, "My aim?"
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "We've yet to discover my aim...wait here."
A swirling portal opens from the Demon Planes and spits out a pathfinder, then vanishes.
Viticus unlocks the southeast door.
Viticus opens the door to the southeast.
Viticus leaves to the southeast.
He is followed by Viticus and a pathfinder.
The door to the southeast closes abruptly.
You hear the door to the southeast being locked.
Viticus arrives from seemingly out of nowhere, being led by a pathfinder demon entity.
He is followed by Viticus and a pathfinder.
Viticus gives five double shot glass to you.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Take that, cautiously. I don't want you mindless and in a heap."
You have emoted: Miana smiles wickedly as the forcefully taps the rim of the first glass with her daegger, causing the glass to split. She throws it down, feeling the alcohol burn her throat, mixing with blood as the glass cuts her lip.
You gulp down whiskey, wetting your palate.
You have emoted: Miana licks away the blood on her lips.
You tilt your head back and slam the whiskey, squinting your eyes as it burns its way down your throat.
You drop a double shot glass.
Viticus purses his lips contemplatively.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says to you, "And now how do you feel?"
You say, "Warmu Relaxcd."
You say, "Ddrphnk."
You fumble about drunkenly.
You say, "Ddguhnk."
You purse your lips contemplatively.
You have emoted: Miana shakes her head at herself, refusing to become frustrated with her stumbling, fumbling actions and slurred speech.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien nods slowly, a hand reaching out in a beconing gesture. "Come forth..." a cold and hollow voice resonates within the foyer.
You have emoted: Miana shifts curiously, setting the rest of the glasses on the ground. She cants her head curiously to one side, staring into the darkness of the foyer.
You have emoted: Miana turns to you, raising an eyebrow questioningly.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien stands up, his body merely inches from yours as his eyes pierce into yours sharply with a void passion. Meanwhile, his hands produce an inking vial and quill from his pouch.
You have emoted: Miana pushes to her feet, slowly, her eyes wandering to the inking vial and quill in your hands.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien places his quill into the vial, inking it in what appears to be a white and pasty liquid. He places the vial down, once the tip is well enough coated and proceeds to wielding his sabre. A hand wraps around your side, pulling you against him as he cuts through the center of your shirt.
You have emoted: Miana clenches her jaws, summoning up the will to resist reflexes to fight back. Her eyes struggle to focus on yours, her movements sluggish.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Good..."
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien pulls down the rest of your shirt so that your upper back and collar bone are exposed. Without thought or hesitation, he quickly steps behind you, wrapping a tight arm around your throat and another around your waist to hold you to his will. "Are you ready torecieve what you desire?".
You have emoted: Miana tenses at your movements but responds without hesitation, "Yes." She stares into the darkness, her eyes losing focus with nothing on which to focus.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien slowly removes his vices upon you, his hands gently caressing your skin with a cold touch that strangely warms your blood as he does so. The quill passes before your eyesight and it begins to look like the light of Moradeim, while he chants breathlessly behind you. Suddenly, rapid stabbing is applied to your back in strict patterns.
You have emoted: Miana clenches her hands into fists, gritting her teeth as she grows accustomed to the pain. Her eyes stay open, becoming more and more focused on the darkness as the feeling of fire burns across her back with the inking process.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien finishes the initial process with a fluorish, as he completes inking a pentagram woven with three equidistant circles between your shoulder blades. He then moves to turn your body, caressing your sides again as he does so. He starts to ink over your collar bone, yelling out demonic incantations. His eyes fade completely to black as the ritual moves along, and the crystal of his staff in the background emits a red glow into the foyer.
You have emoted: Miana resists the urge to roll her shoulders, to ease the itch the burning has caused. Her eyes shift to the shadows cast along the wall by the staff's red glow as she hears your own chants grow louder and louder into shouts. There is only silence in her mind, an eerie calm.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien finishing the inking and becomes still, his eyes fixed on yours though he continues with the incantations. The words begin to seamlessly blend together and the last audible phrase to leave his lips is "Agus dunach ort Tis'Naag." Viticus lifts an imperial finger to strike the fresh inkings on your body and you feel an overwhelming force burst through your being, threatening to blow your heart out.
You have emoted: Miana freezes in place, reflexes unsure of whether to stumble forwards or backwards as her mind interprets the force that hit her. She bites down onto her lip to keep from screaming, blood drawing as she cuts into the flesh with her teeth as the pain engulfs her entire being.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien backs away slowly, keeping his attention fixed on his subject as he watches her wish unfold. The force within your body escalates in pressure and you feel a thick substance wrenching your soul from the inside.
You have emoted: Miana twists her head from side to side as she tries to understand what is happening. She struggles to breath, feeling as if her body might implode or explode, the exhaustion of the pain beginning to settle in. Her cold eyes darken to a deep shade of green, almost black, as they lock onto you, a fearsome rage overcoming her features.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien plants his sabre into the ground, prepared to react though his attention still seems focused on the reactions occuring within you. The vice upon your soul tightens until you feel your soul twisting and rearranging itself from the inside out. "This is only the beginning, Miana. Fear Me not...".
You have emoted: Miana closes her eyes, relaxing her body as she ceases to fight the changes. Her fists and jaws unclench. Her eyelids snap open, her gaze cold and piercing as she watches you curiously. "Fear Me not," she repeats monotonically.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien reapproaches you with ease, moving to stand behind you as he wraps his arm around your waist once more. His right hand moves to stroke through of few strands of your hair as he continues to speak.
Viticus whispers to you, "Tis'Naag, the Mirror Self. That which is born with you, your soul, since the dawn of Creation. Your Tis'Naag has waited many eons within the Demonic Planes for Its chance."
You whisper to Viticus, "And now It has it."
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien whispers "Indeed," as he reaches out with his right hand to grab your own wielding the daegger. "But It cannot manifest completely until you die. Your soul will be trapped on the other side where Its fate was once sealed. Only your mind will remain..." As his last statement is made, the words hang in your ear. His hand guides yours and your daegger deep into your heart, holding it and you as you bleed out.
You have emoted: Miana nods subtly as she watches you guide her own daegger towards her. Her face twists with pain for but a moment as the daegger plunges through her heart, the warm blood spilling out over her hand and yours and onto the floor as she exsanguinates. She feels her body grow weaker and weaker, leaning more into you as she can no longer stand. Her eyes close as the last bit of life ebbs from her body.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien lifts you up into his arms, carrying you towards the Bathory crest on the wall. He kneels before the crest, resting your body over his knee as he removes the daegger. He then in turn slices his own palm to complete the cycle of activation, leaving you to the resurrection of your Tis'Naag.
You have emoted: Miana begins to twitch as her body begins to reawake. The temperature of her skin begins to rise to a degree far from normal for a human. The blood staining her chest begins to sizzle and melt into the skin, sealing the wound in the process and leaving the flesh over her heart raised, scarred. Her left hand slowly lifts into the air, the daegger tearing itself from your hand to return to hers. Her eyelids snap open with a start, her eyes holding a wicked obsidian tint as she slowly sits up.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien tenses slightly, though he retains his demeanor as he watches you rise anew. His eyes begin to swirl with curiosity and he stands up straight as he prepares to encounter your new self.
You have emoted: Miana pushes to her feet with an eerie grace. Her demeanor is cold, and the air seems suffocatingly still in the room. "How different..." she says with an amused curiosity. Her head tilts to one side before straightening as she turns to cast a glance over her shoulder, studying the Bathory crest behind her. "How curious..." She turns to face the crest, tracing its markings with the middle and ring fingers of her right hand. "To feel so strong, so oddly calm with a rage sweltering inside of me." In a swift movement, she steps towards you, her daegger pressed against your throat. She leans closer towards you, keeping the blade to your flesh, as she whispers in your ear, "Thank you for releasing me." Her breath is cool. She takes two quick steps backwards, watching you. The green of her eyes is slowly returning.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien remains frozen in place as he watches your actions, his limbs heavy with a quiver bolting through the muscles of his body. He reapproaches you however, his curiosity of the event taking over his priority as a latent shiver falls over his body.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Is thanks enough, one may wonder."
You have emoted: Miana takes a step closer to you once more. "Is it enough?" she asks curiously, and though her words nor tone seem threatening, her eyes flicker something fierce, dangerous.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien reaches out to grab your chin, pulling your face within an inch of his own as he studies your eyes. "The answers must not come so easily, or you will never learn to control the gift. You are doomed if you cannot even must the power to determine what I want, let alone others."
Viticus whispers to you, "Desire is the fatal weakness of mortals. I have turned yours into strength."
You have emoted: Miana turns her head to pull her chin from your grasp. She stands her ground, turning back to meet your gaze. "What is it that you want?" she asks coolly.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien reaches his right arm out, summoning his staff to his grasp. He sidesteps you and then turns his body far enough to lean against the wall as he closes his eyes.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "I will not tell you, because it will be the challenge that gives rise to your potential. However..."
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "The threads of Fate are not only tied to us, one and all, but a many of things. There is a path to follow, and there are two ends to each."
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "You have but two years to discover what I want. Should you succeed, all that you have ever desired will be at your command and uninhibited."
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "But should you fail..."
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien opens his eyes, the orbs swamped into darkness once more. The colour seems more fluid and lively than before, and becomes apparent of its true nature as it begins to seep out of his eyes and surround the outlines of his form. His voice reaches well into your hearing, echoing in your mind though his lips do not move and you hear him speak "Or you and your blood to follow will become a servant of My House."
You have emoted: Miana immediately takes a step back, recognizing she stands in the presence of something far greater than she. She bows her head in respect. "I understand," she states quickly, her cool tone fading in intimidation.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien raises a palm to his face, covering it as he leans his head back with a slight groan. As his face comes down, he appears to be as normal as he was when you first met. He nods aimlessly as he beckons you to him.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "We shall have to...engage another time."
You say, "We shall."
Viticus nods his head.
Singularity Viticus Bathory, the Mytckah Aerlien says, "Walk well, then."
