suddenly as an alien and frightening look of power sweeps across her face. With
one hand, she reaches forward and as her hand touches Jasmina's chest, it 
flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters her breast. The Seraph's eyes 
roll back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Jasmina's body. 
Jasmina collapses without a sound; her body now nothing more than a useless 
husk.
