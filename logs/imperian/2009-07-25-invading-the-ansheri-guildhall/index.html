From: Matriarch Xylia El'Zaahir, Spirit Eyes
To  : Everyone
Subj: Farewell

I come to you as a messenger of Mintara Nepenthe of the An'sheri.


The An'sheri Tribe will be removing their presence from the Ithaquan
council. We would like to thank the Pines for their protection and
shelter over us. By no means will our separation demand that the
An'sheri revoke their citizenship. We pray that the spirits watch over
Ithaquan in their endeavors. That they protect Her lands from magick and
enemies. We pray your bellies be full and your feet be warm. As always,
the An'sheri are here to serve when magick threatens.

After the disarray that came with the end of the Ilaferi at the hands of the
weak, a small tribe of Amazonian women observed the follies of the elder tribe
and wandered off to find their home in the frozen Pines of Ithaqua. With time,
they came together as a tribe and named themselves the Ansheri, a term of old
for a noble and respectable woman.
 
An Ansheri is a huntress, desiring the close kinship with their sisters over
the frivolities of life. Courage, strength, honesty, and intelligence are what
make the Ansheri what they are. They are women of excellence - holding
themselves to higher standards so that they might live as examples for all
women. Those things along with their fierce determination and guidance of their
Keh'ulani spirits will help them push forward to a strong future.
 
Magick, demons, and weakness are their enemies - using whatever abilities and
strength they possess to see to their end. They rely on each other more then
anything else, seeking to strengthen each other and push the bonds between them
all to be deeper than the ties of any bloodline. They welcome any woman to try
their hand at becoming one of their blood-bound sisters, but be warned - those
that find themselves lacking will quickly find that the Ansheri have no qualms
about tossing one not worthy to the wolves.

Within a large, hollow ironwood tree.
The heartwood interior of this massive black ironwood tree has been 
hand-chipped and hollowed out to create a large circular room. The walls are 
well-insulated with panels of hardened leather and layers of various animal 
pelts. Some of the pelts are simply fur coverings and others have been tanned 
to create smooth surfaces that allow a crafter to easily burn or pound designs 
into. The symbols and designs on these tanned pelts reveal different races of 
women with the heads of various beasts illustrated in bloody battles, 
extravagant celebrations or sacred rituals. The lofty, high ceiling of the tree
tapers to a subtle, cone-shaped design that are lined with etched mirrors 
pointing towards the center of the room's roof. Long, roughly-crafted shelves 
line the southern wall of the great tree and are packed with an array of 
various scrolls, books and tomes. Just left of the bookshelves is a wide 
opening in the hard-packed dirt floor made accessible by a built-in wooden 
ladder. Wisps of steam and the sound of flowing water drifts in from the east 
where a narrow archway of braided vine leads to the hall's bathing chamber. To 
the southeast, small window has been dug into the tree's wall to reveal the 
scenic Ithaquan forest outside the ironwood. The thick glass is simple, 
unetched and frosted heavily with the winter's cold caress. This has been 
marked as holy ground. A length of braided vine rope hangs off to the side, its
terminus somewhere inside the tree. A weather-beaten chest sits here filling 
the room with the scent of cedar wood. A lithe desert fox slinks cunningly 
nearby. A darkly-colored, mink fur tapestry covers a greater portion of the

easily, though her eyes are alert, a javelin in hand as she observes her

a forbidding white wolf sits here impassively. The shining figure of a Seraphic
guardian floats in the air here. This is a library. Taina Savann, Tribal 
Makarin is here. She wields a curved sabre in her left hand and a cavalry

Within a large, hollow ironwood tree.
The heartwood interior of this massive black ironwood tree has been 
hand-chipped and hollowed out to create a large circular room. The walls are 
well-insulated with panels of hardened leather and layers of various animal 
pelts. Some of the pelts are simply fur coverings and others have been tanned 
to create smooth surfaces that allow a crafter to easily burn or pound designs 
into. The symbols and designs on these tanned pelts reveal different races of 
women with the heads of various beasts illustrated in bloody battles, 
extravagant celebrations or sacred rituals. The lofty, high ceiling of the tree
tapers to a subtle, cone-shaped design that are lined with etched mirrors 
pointing towards the center of the room's roof. Long, roughly-crafted shelves 
line the southern wall of the great tree and are packed with an array of 
various scrolls, books and tomes. Just left of the bookshelves is a wide 
opening in the hard-packed dirt floor made accessible by a built-in wooden 
ladder. Wisps of steam and the sound of flowing water drifts in from the east 
where a narrow archway of braided vine leads to the hall's bathing chamber. To 
the southeast, small window has been dug into the tree's wall to reveal the 
scenic Ithaquan forest outside the ironwood. The thick glass is simple, 
unetched and frosted heavily with the winter's cold caress. This has been 
marked as holy ground. A length of braided vine rope hangs off to the side, its
terminus somewhere inside the tree. A weather-beaten chest sits here filling 
the room with the scent of cedar wood. A lithe desert fox slinks cunningly 
nearby. A darkly-colored, mink fur tapestry covers a greater portion of the 
wall. A circular, luxurious sheepskin rug has been placed in the center of the 
room. There are 2 blackened iron wall sconces here. Carefully watching 
everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. A Tanari woman rests 
easily, though her eyes are alert, a javelin in hand as she observes her 
surroundings. A bushy tailed fox is sniffing around. Settled upon his haunches,
a forbidding white wolf sits here impassively. The shining figure of a Seraphic
guardian floats in the air here. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies 
here. The decaying remains of Rudha lie here. The decaying remains of Divanna 
lie here. The decapitated head of Taina has been carelessly tossed aside. The 
decaying remains of Meabh lie here. This is a library. The soul of An'sheri 
Meabh, Hirai of Ukume roams the land, bodiless. Draven Acerbus is here. He 
wields a spiritual mace in his left hand. Feyn Kayden Midbere, Light's Avatar 
is here, hidden. He wields an Illuminai tower shield in his left hand and a 
Deathwind sitara in his right.

To : Everyone
Subj: Farewell
I come to you as a messenger of Mintara Nepenthe of the An'sheri.
The An'sheri Tribe will be removing their presence from the Ithaquan
council. We would like to thank the Pines for their protection and

the An'sheri are here to serve when magick threatens.

After the disarray that came with the end of the Ilaferi at the hands of the
weak, a small tribe of Amazonian women observed the follies of the elder tribe
and wandered off to find their home in the frozen Pines of Ithaqua. With time,
they came together as a tribe and named themselves the Ansheri, a term of old
for a noble and respectable woman.
An Ansheri is a huntress, desiring the close kinship with their sisters over
the frivolities of life. Courage, strength, honesty, and intelligence are what
make the Ansheri what they are. They are women of excellence - holding
themselves to higher standards so that they might live as examples for all
women. Those things along with their fierce determination and guidance of their
Keh'ulani spirits will help them push forward to a strong future.
Magick, demons, and weakness are their enemies - using whatever abilities and
strength they possess to see to their end. They rely on each other more then
anything else, seeking to strengthen each other and push the bonds between them
all to be deeper than the ties of any bloodline. They welcome any woman to try
their hand at becoming one of their blood-bound sisters, but be warned - those
that find themselves lacking will quickly find that the Ansheri have no qualms
about tossing one not worthy to the wolves.

l
Within a large, hollow ironwood tree.
The heartwood interior of this massive black ironwood tree has been
hand-chipped and hollowed out to create a large circular room. The walls are
well-insulated with panels of hardened leather and layers of various animal
pelts. Some of the pelts are simply fur coverings and others have been tanned
to create smooth surfaces that allow a crafter to easily burn or pound designs
into. The symbols and designs on these tanned pelts reveal different races of
women with the heads of various beasts illustrated in bloody battles,
extravagant celebrations or sacred rituals. The lofty, high ceiling of the tree
tapers to a subtle, cone-shaped design that are lined with etched mirrors
pointing towards the center of the room's roof. Long, roughly-crafted shelves
line the southern wall of the great tree and are packed with an array of
various scrolls, books and tomes. Just left of the bookshelves is a wide
opening in the hard-packed dirt floor made accessible by a built-in wooden
ladder. Wisps of steam and the sound of flowing water drifts in from the east
where a narrow archway of braided vine leads to the hall's bathing chamber. To
the southeast, small window has been dug into the tree's wall to reveal the
scenic Ithaquan forest outside the ironwood. The thick glass is simple,
unetched and frosted heavily with the winter's cold caress. This has been
marked as holy ground. A length of braided vine rope hangs off to the side, its
terminus somewhere inside the tree. A weather-beaten chest sits here filling
the room with the scent of cedar wood. A lithe desert fox slinks cunningly
nearby. A darkly-colored, mink fur tapestry covers a greater portion of the
wall. A circular, luxurious sheepskin rug has been placed in the center of the
room. There are 2 blackened iron wall sconces here. Carefully watching
everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. A Tanari woman rests
easily, though her eyes are alert, a javelin in hand as she observes her
surroundings. A bushy tailed fox is sniffing around. Settled upon his haunches,
a forbidding white wolf sits here impassively. The shining figure of a Seraphic
guardian floats in the air here. This is a library. Taina Savann, Tribal
Makarin is here. She wields a curved sabre in her left hand and a cavalry
shield in her right. An'sheri Rudha Viantha, of Ukume is here. She wields a
truesilver shield in her left hand and a sleek javelin in her right. Feyn
Kayden Midbere, Light's Avatar is here, hidden. He wields an Illuminai tower

l
Within a large, hollow ironwood tree.
The heartwood interior of this massive black ironwood tree has been
hand-chipped and hollowed out to create a large circular room. The walls are
well-insulated with panels of hardened leather and layers of various animal
pelts. Some of the pelts are simply fur coverings and others have been tanned
to create smooth surfaces that allow a crafter to easily burn or pound designs
into. The symbols and designs on these tanned pelts reveal different races of
women with the heads of various beasts illustrated in bloody battles,
extravagant celebrations or sacred rituals. The lofty, high ceiling of the tree
tapers to a subtle, cone-shaped design that are lined with etched mirrors
pointing towards the center of the room's roof. Long, roughly-crafted shelves
line the southern wall of the great tree and are packed with an array of
various scrolls, books and tomes. Just left of the bookshelves is a wide
opening in the hard-packed dirt floor made accessible by a built-in wooden
ladder. Wisps of steam and the sound of flowing water drifts in from the east
where a narrow archway of braided vine leads to the hall's bathing chamber. To
the southeast, small window has been dug into the tree's wall to reveal the
scenic Ithaquan forest outside the ironwood. The thick glass is simple,
unetched and frosted heavily with the winter's cold caress. This has been
marked as holy ground. A length of braided vine rope hangs off to the side, its
terminus somewhere inside the tree. A weather-beaten chest sits here filling
the room with the scent of cedar wood. A lithe desert fox slinks cunningly
nearby. A darkly-colored, mink fur tapestry covers a greater portion of the
wall. A circular, luxurious sheepskin rug has been placed in the center of the
room. There are 2 blackened iron wall sconces here. Carefully watching
everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. A Tanari woman rests
easily, though her eyes are alert, a javelin in hand as she observes her
surroundings. A bushy tailed fox is sniffing around. Settled upon his haunches,
a forbidding white wolf sits here impassively. The shining figure of a Seraphic
guardian floats in the air here. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies
here. The decaying remains of Rudha lie here. The decaying remains of Divanna
lie here. The decapitated head of Taina has been carelessly tossed aside. The
decaying remains of Meabh lie here. This is a library. The soul of An'sheri
Meabh, Hirai of Ukume roams the land, bodiless. Draven Acerbus is here. He
wields a spiritual mace in his left hand. Feyn Kayden Midbere, Light's Avatar
is here, hidden. He wields an Illuminai tower shield in his left hand and a
Deathwind sitara in his right.
You see exits leading east, south, and down.
