After killing Rafe and going back to Antioch...

Kinsarmar Road inside Caanae Gate. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A Baar shrine statuette has been 
strategically placed here. An elite Antioch cleric is manning a bolt thrower 
here. She has 100 bolts. A fearless Shaahri stallion trots about. A black wolf 
stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey.
You see exits leading southwest, northwest, and a set of ornately wrought, 
massive gates stand to the northeast (gate open).
<622/624h 365/370m 2263e 1581w <eb> <bd> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> (2 - southwest)

Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your 
feet. An intricately carved muamrite guard&#39;s spear lies abandoned here. An 
armoured knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel
before a fierce lion. The shop directory of Antioch rests here on a marble 
pedestal. There are 2 elite Justicar of the Shahs here. An elite Antioch cleric
is manning a cannon here. She has 100 cannon balls. Arching up towards the sky,
with a curtain of shifting light hung within it, the Lunar Pylon stands proudly
here. A Baar shrine statuette has been strategically placed here. Head lifted 
regally in memory of bygone days, a crimson stallion stands here stone still. 
Strong of stature, a strapping buckskin mare stands here. An elegant white 
letter is in danger of being soiled here. A lean coyote prowls around the 
forest, his nose sniffing along the ground for prey. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage
grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Azyel Shinpachi is here, 
hidden. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and an ivory sitara in his 
right. Beauty of the Desert Noralie Covante Revivalist is here. She wields a 
spiritual mace in her left hand and a tower shield in her right. Tekkor Askare 
is here. He wields a chill-blue sitara in his left hand. Tiya Covante is here, 
camouflaged. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to 
see what is for sale.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, and northwest.

You step in quickly with a slash across an impassive mercenary&#39;s torso.
You have scored an awe inspiring hit to your target!!!
The final blow proves too much for an impassive mercenary, who expires, 
pitifully.
You have slain an impassive mercenary.
A large pile of sovereigns spills from the corpse.
You quickly flow into the Ein-Fasit stance.
