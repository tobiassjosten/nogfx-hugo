Runi’s poignant and eloquently worded issue is a call to arms I cannot ignore. I can stay silent no longer, I must share my dreadful story.</p><hr><p>My day does not begin as yours does. As the narrowest sliver of sun breaks over the horizon and I begin to stir from the giant pile of my parents credit cards on which I sleep, the nightmare truly begins. With a crash, all four newly repaired windows of my bedroom shatter inward as a crack team of ninjas rappels through them, Kayden at their head. I know it’s Kayden because he’s riding a unicorn, trailing rainbows and constantly making sarcastic remarks about Obama’s commitment to gay rights issues.</p><p>“Back you tastefully dressed fiend!” I scream frantically, horror making my voice shrill. “I’m not going to play Imperian today, it’s clear I’m not wanted and it just leads to problems, I’m going to find a new hobby,” I protest in vain as they seize me and drag me toward my computer.</p><p>It’s futile. Within moments I’m bound to my chair and the Imperian loading screen flashes before me. Their dreadful deed done, Kayden and the ninjas disappear, leaving behind traces of broken glass, glitter and the last few bars of “it’s raining men.”</p><p>Though I know it’s futile, I still unconsciously fight the inevitable. I think to myself, “I’ll keep my head down today, maybe do some bashing, a bit of city defense, not antagonize anyone&mldr;” No sooner had I finished forming the thought than the western wall of my house crashed inward. There in the breach, like an avatar of terror conjured by the imagination of an angry god stood Ahkan, ensconced as always in his mighty hamster ball. I cowered as he looked down at me and commanded, “Thou shalt be douchey!” Unable to resist that awesome will and knowing that if I did, he’d probably make a forum post declaring victory anyway, I hastened to make an ass of myself all over Imperian.</p><p>Hours and hundreds of dumb acts later, I stare through tear filled eyes at the screen and realize I can take no more. With leaden hands, I decide to retreat to the Imperian forums, a place famous for its intelligence, understanding and civility. “I shall post something constructive or amusing,” I decide, “perhaps an insightful comment about balance that acknowledges that my knowledge is less than total and that there might be other points of view.” I determine to post my comment with good grammar, a gentlemanly tone and a functioning sense of self irony. Yet once more, I am thwarted.</p><p>Light seems to drain from the room as the darkness flows together, coalescing into a writhing ball of shadow. From within the boiling nether steps Sadie, shrouded as always in a powerful haze of gender ambiguity and not dating Sagron. Like a storied dark king/queen of yore Sadie points toward me and tendrils of stupidity flow through my mind, dulling my thoughts and making my comments stupid, ignorant and whiny.</p><hr><p>That is just a snapshot of the horrors I face daily. Bless you Runi, for finally giving me the strength to speak out about the nightmare that is my reality.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9709d27e0c92499c995b65a9553028e0?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by tonykunz@xxx on 20 Nov 2010</p>I love it!</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb8831312d001f276392ca77560b7b08?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by loocodnom@xxx on 20 Nov 2010</p>Falsified issue.
