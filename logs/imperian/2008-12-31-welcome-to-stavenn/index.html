Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says, in Hanyou, "I was."

Linslet&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Imperator Sagron Savet says to Suza, "Watch. Learn. Understand what awaits those who leave our ranks only to come crawling back when the discover our supremacy."

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit watches in silence and slowly makes his way behind Anarion.

You nod your acknowledgement of Suza.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General quickly unleashes his blades with a flick of his wrists. The edges of the sabres quickly find Anarion&#39;s soft flesh along the backs of his ankles laying them open as blood begins to pour out. The sharpened edges of the blades easily pass along Anarion&#39;s forearms and trails of snaguis begin to slowly creep along his arms.

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot comes up behind Anarion, grabbing at his neck. Her cobra slides from her sleeve, latching onto his jugular and delivering a painful venom.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Sagron, "Do we really need all these children here, Imperator? I find them bothersome."

Imperator Sagron Savet says to Ren, "It is an educational experience."

Blackguard Anarion Reopev grunts loudly, closing his eyes, making an effort to keep silent as his hands tremble.

Imperator Sagron Savet says to Ren, "Masters of your tier are not born, they are made."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems points his finger at Anarion, and his skin bubbles with decaying flesh.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General grins slightly as he deal four quick cuts to Anarion&#39;s chest and abdomen, immediately followed a vertical slice from his neck to his waist.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says, in Hanyou, "You flatter me."

Samiel ponders the situation.

Imperator Sagron Savet says to Ren, "I may end up under your ministrations myself, one of these days. It pays to build up goodwill."

Blackguard Anarion Reopev mutters, "I&#39;m not going to .....m for your wort...ss cravens. I could ..ll any of you."

Anarion shudders violently.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "That may be true, mm."

Imperator Sagron Savet says, "He can still speak and form coherent thought, impressive. Someone fix it."

Suza smirks.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General places the sharpened edge of a sabre against Anarion&#39;s mouth.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General asks Sagron, "Shall I?"

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot says, "Oooh, I&#39;ve an idea~."

Blackguard Anarion Reopev twitches as the blade presses against his mouth, keeping his eyes closed.

Samiel swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit leans down close to Anarion.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General says, "I&#39;ll take that as a yes..."

Ren whispers something to Anarion.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General slides the blade across the sides of Anarion&#39;s mouth as the skin peels away from itself and blood runs freely down his face.

Samiel carefully wipes all the toxins off of a curved sabre.

Samiel carefully wipes all the toxins off of a curved sabre.

Samiel ponders a curved sabre&#39;s profile, wondering if it would make a suitable subject for a portrait.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General says, "A bit sticky.."

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit moves a steadying hand to Anarion&#39;s shoulder.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems points his finger at Anarion while mumbling, blood begins to flow freely from his eyes.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev shivers in pain, dropping the spear out of his hands,
keeping his mouth closed in a great display of effort.

Anarion drops a hunter&#39;s spear.

Looking about in utter boredom, Samiel swings his tail about in circles making it resemble a whip.

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot places her dirk at Anarion&#39;s neck, making a small incision, she leans down to eye level with him, giggling madly as she slides a finger into the bleeding crevice.  
She twists it painfully around as if grasping for something, finally pulling his tounge through it.

Samiel ponders the situation.

You have emoted: Alaia takes a casual step forward, running a long forefinger along the blade of her dagger as she eyes Anarion, her lips curling into a grim smile. Wrapping her fingers around one of his wrists she yanks his hand towards herself, placing the sharpened tip of the blade to the cuticle of his middle finger, driving the blade deep underneath the nail before angling the dagger  upwards, causing the nail to come free from the flesh of his finger. As the nail falls to the floor, she bends over to pick it up, turning to hand the bloodied nail to Suza.

Suza whispers to you, "Oo pitty Edmund isn&#39;t here."

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems takes up a doll of Anarion in his hand, and applies pressure to the legs before ripping off an arm.

Luodo moves over to block the north exit.

Suza flashes you a joyous smile.

Samiel looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev gives a final shudder, falling over to the ground in agony, body convulsing in pain.

Imperator Sagron Savet says, "This is more like it."

Luodo begins to follow you.

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot says, "Awww, he&#39;s not done is he~?"

Anarion sits down.

Salish spits in Anarion&#39;s face.

You have emoted: Alaia delivers a sharp kick to Anarion&#39;s jaw, attempting to stifle a snicker as she does so.

Your ally, Caitryn Devilen, Wandering Seeker, has entered Imperian.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev twitches sporadically, eyes and mouth remaining closed.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General plants his boot in the middle of Anarion&#39;s chest to steady him. He relaxes the tip of a sabre against Anarion&#39;s stomach as he leans slightly on the blade.

Diavlous Suza Scrae&#39;Uden, Squire of Blood says, "I must admit Harbinger, I am learning alot from this."

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot flops sown on Anarion, letting her knee drop deep into his stomach.  Leaning over, she giggles happily as she brings her fingers gently to his eyes, peeling the lids of his eyes upwards and slicing them each off.

Imperator Sagron Savet idly shuffles a Priestess card out of a tarot deck and flicks it toward Anarion, delivering a sharp kick to limit the healing power to only that which will keep him alive.

Linslet whispers something to Anarion.

The door to the north is opened from the other side.

Caitryn arrives from the north.

Sagron closes the door to the north.

Linslet giggles happily.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems whispers something to the doll of Anarion. Anarion&#39;s eyes fly open.

Lord Salish Scrae&#39;Uden, Subjugator of Totems says, "You don&#39;t want to miss this."

Samiel swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev becomes almost entirely limp, appearing to be unconscious.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General begins to lean more heavily on the sabre now as the blade inches it&#39;s way into the stomach of Anarion. After a moment, the blade ceases to move and a barely audible click can be heard as the tip makes contact with the ground.

Linslet slaps Anarion on the cheek.

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General asks, "Anyone have some whiskey or something of the sort?"

Samiel swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Diavlous Suza Scrae&#39;Uden, Squire of Blood says, "I have some toxins."

Samiel shakes his head.

Acolyte Lyon says, "I can go fetch some."

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot says, "Stay with it! This is the greatest moment of your life and you&#39;re off missing it!"

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General says, "I want alcohol specifically."

Echoes of ritual chanting rise and fall in a rhythmic beat.

Samiel smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Caitryn gives a canteen of whiskey to Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General.

You have emoted: Alaia leans down before Anarion, crouching steadily as she extends her left hand to his shoulder, holding him steady with her right as she grazes the blade of the dagger over his scales. Angling the dagger again, she sticks the tip under one of his scales, pulling it free from his flesh before taking it in hand. Standing straight again, she holds the scale up to the available light, murmur slightly more to herself than to others, "I&#39;ve always wanted one of these.".

Comprehension flashes across Samiel&#39;s face.

Caitryn winks at Samiel.

Suza smirks at you.

Imperator Sagron Savet says, "That is enough, Linslet, Alaia, Samiel, Salish."

Salish nods his head.

Samiel snaps his fingers.

Samiel points accusingly at a canteen of whiskey.

You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.

You say, "Aye, Imperator."

Imperator Sagron Savet says, "Ren, it is your show."

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot says, "Awww~."

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General says, "Was going to give him a drink."

Samiel grins mischievously.

Suza brushes her hair aside.

Imperator Sagron Savet says, "Let us hear from the sadistic voice of experience."

Lord Samiel De&#39;Linguilette, Quartermaster General withdraws the sabre from Anarion&#39;s gut before quietly wiping his blades off.

Samiel&#39;s eyes gleam with generosity.

Samiel gives a canteen of whiskey to Caitryn Devilen, Wandering Seeker.

Samiel swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says, in Hanyou, "I think few of you realize how powerful a bit of speech can be. With the state he&#39;s in, that will matter little now. Pain can consume one&#39;s mind and leave little else to be done."

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot sighs sadly, raising from her position.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit crouches down, glancing over Anarion&#39;s bloody and butchered form.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit mutters, in Hanyou, "Butch..&#39;s work. .e&#39;s . man not some ...n stuck pig."

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit produces a flask from his pouch and swirls it around, gently lifting up Anarion&#39;s head and puts it to his lips, pouring the concoction down his throat.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev jerks awake, groaning in anguish, his eyes twitching from side to side.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "You&#39;re a bloody mess, eh?"

Blackguard Anarion Reopev sputters and coughs, shaking in pain, unable to form words.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "And you&#39;ve lost everything too. Where&#39;s that old pride of yours, mm?"

Blackguard Anarion Reopev tries to focus his vision on Ren. He gives up after a moment, resting his head on the cold floor, still sputtering.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Take your time. I&#39;d like to hear you whine at me."

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit flicks out a brightly coloured tarot card and flings it at Anarion, his wounds slowly beginning to fade about his mouth and throat.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev coughs as the wounds heal, breathing in loudly.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "This is what you.."

Anarion coughs softly.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "This is what you left Antioch for? To work with these maggots?"

Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "You and I were brothers, damn it.."

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Mind your tongue. They don&#39;t have the patience that I do."

Sagron whispers something to Ren.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev slams his head into the floor angrily, unable to move the rest of his form.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit nods to Sagron.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev mutters, "This i. ...t I&#39;m reduced to."

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says, in Hanyou, "It was your own choice that brought you to this. You have only yourself to blame. A sorry little man, in the end."

Suza brushes her hair aside.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "End this already, Ren. If any part of you is still a man, give me the death I deserve."

Caitryn tilts her head curiously at Anarion.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Where&#39;s all that hatred and bile you had for me before?"

Blackguard Anarion Reopev laughs softly to himself, staring at the wall in front of him.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Look at me."

Blackguard Anarion Reopev turns his gaze to Ren, still laughing. "You know Sagron&#39;s going to give me axes. Then I&#39;m going to cut out your pretty throat.".

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit gives a slow grin.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "Then I&#39;m going to cut out Kira&#39;s."

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says to Sagron, in Hanyou, "I&#39;ve finished with him. Take care of him, Lord Imperator."

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit stands slowly.

Augur Ren Fel&#39;Amrit says, in Hanyou, "Kira&#39;s, mm? I&#39;d like to be there for that."

Sagron strokes Anarion&#39;s arm, withering it into nothing.

Sagron grabs Anarion&#39;s leg, which shrivels away.

Imperator Sagron Savet laughingly says, "Welcome to Stavenn."

Sagron wreathes his hand in crackling black energy. With a diabolical laugh, he stiffens his hand and slowly runs it down Anarion&#39;s splayed-out body, splitting his chest in two as he does so. Though Anarion screams in pain and begs to die, Sagron proceeds to rip apart his organs. Finally, with a detached smile upon  his face, he proceeds to rip the sternum out of Anarion&#39;s body and drive it  through his body, pinning it to the ground and killing him instantly. 
Anarion has been slain by Sagron.
Anarion drops a linseed.

You grin mischievously at Sagron.

Samiel swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Overcome by death, Anarion&#39;s spirit fades to grey.'>Suza tells you, "Can I hurt him?"
Imperator Sagron Savet says to Anarion, "A wise man doesn't insult women about to torture him, but I guess wisdom was never an accusation leveled at your person."
The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot says, "Oooooh, he's sharp~!"
Linslet claps her hands together merrily.
The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot says to Sagron, "Can I keep him?"
Blackguard Anarion Reopev says to Sagron, "No. I'm just a tool. And soon, I'll be your tool to point at people. Enjoy the savagery."

The sharpened edges of the blades easily pass along Anarion's forearms and trails of snaguis begin to slowly creep along his arms.
The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot comes up behind Anarion, grabbing at his neck. Her cobra slides from her sleeve, latching onto his jugular and delivering a painful venom.
Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Sagron, "Do we really need all these children here, Imperator? I find them bothersome."
Imperator Sagron Savet says to Ren, "It is an educational experience."

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says, in Hanyou, "You flatter me."
Samiel ponders the situation.
Imperator Sagron Savet says to Ren, "I may end up under your ministrations myself, one of these days. It pays to build up goodwill."
Blackguard Anarion Reopev mutters, "I'm not going to .....m for your wort...ss cravens. I could ..ll any of you."
Anarion shudders violently.
Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "That may be true, mm."
Imperator Sagron Savet says, "He can still speak and form coherent thought, impressive. Someone fix it."
Suza smirks.
Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General places the sharpened edge of a sabre against Anarion's mouth.
Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General asks Sagron, "Shall I?"

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot places her dirk at Anarion's neck, making a small incision, she leans down to eye level with him, giggling madly as she slides a finger into the bleeding crevice.
She twists it painfully around as if grasping for something, finally pulling his tounge through it.
Samiel ponders the situation.
You have emoted: Alaia takes a casual step forward, running a long forefinger along the blade of her dagger as she eyes Anarion, her lips curling into a grim smile. Wrapping her fingers around one of his wrists she yanks his hand towards herself, placing the sharpened tip of the blade to the cuticle of his middle finger, driving the blade deep underneath the nail before angling the dagger upwards, causing the nail to come free from the flesh of his finger. As the nail falls to the floor, she bends over to pick it up, turning to hand the bloodied nail to Suza.
Suza whispers to you, "Oo pitty Edmund isn't here."

Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General plants his boot in the middle of Anarion's chest to steady him. He relaxes the tip of a sabre against Anarion's stomach as he leans slightly on the blade.
Diavlous Suza Scrae'Uden, Squire of Blood says, "I must admit Harbinger, I am learning alot from this."
The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot flops sown on Anarion, letting her knee drop deep into his stomach. Leaning over, she giggles happily as she brings her fingers gently to his eyes, peeling the lids of his eyes upwards and slicing them each off.
Imperator Sagron Savet idly shuffles a Priestess card out of a tarot deck and flicks it toward Anarion, delivering a sharp kick to limit the healing power to only that which will keep him alive.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev becomes almost entirely limp, appearing to be unconscious.
Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General begins to lean more heavily on the sabre now as the blade inches it's way into the stomach of Anarion. After a moment, the blade ceases to move and a barely audible click can be heard as the tip makes contact with the ground.
Linslet slaps Anarion on the cheek.
Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General asks, "Anyone have some whiskey or something of the sort?"

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot says, "Stay with it! This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off missing it!"
Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General says, "I want alcohol specifically."
Echoes of ritual chanting rise and fall in a rhythmic beat.
Samiel smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Caitryn gives a canteen of whiskey to Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General.
You have emoted: Alaia leans down before Anarion, crouching steadily as she extends her left hand to his shoulder, holding him steady with her right as she grazes the blade of the dagger over his scales. Angling the dagger again, she sticks the tip under one of his scales, pulling it free from his flesh before taking it in hand. Standing straight again, she holds the scale up to the available light, murmur slightly more to herself than to others, "I've always wanted one of these.".
Comprehension flashes across Samiel's face.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says, in Hanyou, "I think few of you realize how powerful a bit of speech can be. With the state he's in, that will matter little now. Pain can consume one's mind and leave little else to be done."
The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot sighs sadly, raising from her position.
Augur Ren Fel'Amrit crouches down, glancing over Anarion's bloody and butchered form.
Augur Ren Fel'Amrit mutters, in Hanyou, "Butch..'s work. .e's . man not some ...n stuck pig."

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says, in Hanyou, "It was your own choice that brought you to this. You have only yourself to blame. A sorry little man, in the end."
Suza brushes her hair aside.
Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "End this already, Ren. If any part of you is still a man, give me the death I deserve."
Caitryn tilts her head curiously at Anarion.
Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Where's all that hatred and bile you had for me before?"
Blackguard Anarion Reopev laughs softly to himself, staring at the wall in front of him.
Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Look at me."
Blackguard Anarion Reopev turns his gaze to Ren, still laughing. "You know Sagron's going to give me axes. Then I'm going to cut out your pretty throat.".
