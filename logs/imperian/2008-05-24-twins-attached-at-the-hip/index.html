&lt;53/407h 166/241m 1721e 1026w 20x &lt;-bpp> &lt;sb> &lt;p>>
Akumu's arms suddenly slump down, the weight of the objects he's carrying
almost too much for him.
&lt;53/407h 166/241m 1721e 1026w 20x &lt;-bpp> &lt;sb> &lt;p>>
You open your eyes and yawn mightily.

Enteri stands up and stretches his arms out wide.
&lt;53/407h 166/241m 1721e 1026w 20x &lt;-bpp> &lt;sb> &lt;p>>
Enteri lunges forward suddenly, catching you by surprise as he bashes your face
with his shield.
You pitch forward onto the ground, vision fading to black.
&lt;33/407h 166/241m 1721e 1026w 20x &lt;-bpp> &lt;sb> &lt;p> &lt;-20>>

&lt;33/407h 166/241m 1721e 1026w 20x &lt;ebpp> &lt;s> &lt;p>>
Akumu draws in a steadying breath.
&lt;33/407h 161/241m 1721e 1025w 20x &lt;ebpp> &lt;s> &lt;p>>
Akumu starts to wield a hornbow in his hands.
&lt;33/407h 161/241m 1721e 1025w 20x &lt;ebpp> &lt;s> &lt;p>>
Akumu wraps thin strips of leather around his wrists and attaches them to his
wielded items.
&lt;33/407h 161/241m 1721e 1025w 20x &lt;ebpp> &lt;s> &lt;p>>
Panic overcomes you as Akumu draws back his bowstring and releases an arrow, a
thin trail of smoke left by the burning fuse as it flys toward you.
Sparks catch your eye as an arrow cuts through the air, burying itself deep in
your flesh. Noticing the fuse which burns upon it through the blinding pain,
you are almost overcome with panic.
[ *** Warning!! Possible instant kill! *** ]
&lt;2/407h 161/241m 1721e 1025w 20x &lt;ebpp> &lt;s> &lt;p> &lt;-31>> (pull arrow from body)
You fall to the ground as the last drops of life-giving blood drain out of your
body.
You have been slain by Akumu. (all)
Your wounds cause you to bleed 2 health.
