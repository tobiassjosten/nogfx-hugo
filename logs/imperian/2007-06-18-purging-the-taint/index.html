A spherical sandstone chamber. (lost) (Nowhere.)
This has been marked as holy ground. Farooq, special advisor to the Ordikara, 
is here. A roughly hewn semicircle of pure white marble rests opposite a 
similarly shaped gleaming onyx stone, their halves touching to form a seamless 
circle. Growing from the center of the simple circular structure is a huge oak 
tree, its branches bare of any leaves or acorns. A gleaming onyx raven perches 
on a bare branch above the white marble slab while a snow-white hawk balances 
gracefully on a bare branch above the onyx. A bald eagle soars about on the 
thermal currents.

He is an armored akrabi and is quite average for an Akrabi. He stands at 5 foot
10, and is quite slimmer than most. His body is almost completely hidden in a 
robe. His face is quite plain, dark blue with black beady eyes. His right hand 
is gnarled, and instead of fingers he has sharp talons, the rest of his arms 
are covered in robes, though his left hand seems fine. He is wearing a black 
Taekyon belt, a gold, vine etched tail ring, an anklet of white marble and 
gleaming onyx, a suit of leather armour, a pair of leather boots, a banded 
shield, a hooded, sand colored robe, a silk pack, a blood red mask, and a 
glittering white mask. He wields a hard-edge broadsword in his left hand and a 
banded shield in his right. He is surrounded by the fluctuating aura of the 
Boon of Change.

You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "I hear words most distressing about you, 
Brother."

A masked woman taps her tail against the ground.

"Oh?" Jimek exclaims quizzically.

You tap your tail against the ground.

You say, in Akrabi, "Reveal your right arm, immediately."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "No."

You click and chitter angrily.

A masked woman squints suspiciously at Jimek.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "My shame is my own."

You say, in Akrabi, "I care little about your &#39;shame&#39;. Reveal it."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "You have my answer."

Jimek ceases to wield a hard-edge broadsword in his left hand.

Jimek takes up a banded shield in his left hand.

Jimek ceases to wield a banded shield in his right hand.

Jimek takes up a banded shield in his right hand.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I&#39;ll not willingly shame myself."

You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "I will say it once again. Reveal it, or I will 
lock you in a salvation chamber, and you will endure far bigger pains than 
shame."

You say, in Akrabi, "I am quite aware of what has happened to you..."

You spit on the ground in disgust.

A masked woman says, in Akrabi, "Why has happened?"

A masked woman says, in Akrabi, "What, rather."

Jimek nods his head.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I was taken."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "My arm removed."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "And replaced with this."

Jimek Qaqyesil eyes his covered arm in disgust.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "You need not see it."

Dist tells you, in Akrabi, "I must depart."

A masked woman narrows her eyes to thin slits.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "And it is my own problem."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I will handle it as I see fit."

A masked woman snorts arrogantly.

Dist grows still and his lips begin to move silently.

Dist nods his head politely.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Anything else is not fitting of a Manoan, nor 
an Illuminai."

You say, in Akrabi, "It is no such thing."

You say, in Akrabi, "You have been tainted, Jimek, and hiding that fact 
indicates one thing only."

A masked woman says to Jimek, in Akrabi, "It is more than your problem - you 
taint the Order of the Pure with your ...deformity."

A masked woman clicks and chitters angrily.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I was deformed by my own weakness."

You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "You no longer have a say in what you do or not 
regarding it. From now on, we will handle this."

Jimek clicks and chitters in agitation.

You say, in Akrabi, "Until we bring you salvation, you are, much to my shame, 
nothing but filith."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Choose your next words wisely."

A masked woman smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I wished no help."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "If you insist, I will allow you to do as you 
will."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "But I am afraid, I am -not- filth."

You say, in Akrabi, "Your...arm taints your whole. You may ask for no help, but 
you require it, desperately."

Jimek Qaqyesil bows his head and sighs to himself. Raising his head, he nods.

Jimek Qaqyesil pulls back his robe, and reveals his deformed arm.

A masked woman eyes Jimek&#39;s arm with disgust.

You have emoted: Orovan moves closer to Jimek, eyeing the torn, demonic arm 
with suspicion, and he mutters, half to himself, "I do not know why you thought
I would not know of this. I have ears and eyes everywhere...this delay does 
nothing but shame you, and me by association.".

You say, in Akrabi, "This will require better tools."

A masked woman gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

A musty laboratory. (Nowhere.?)
Appearing to have long ago been the catacombs for those granted a prestigious 
rank within an organization, the sandstone walls of this room have deep 
recesses carved into them. Underground scavengers, likely locusts, have long 
ago cleared the previous occupants of this room away, the room itself has now 
been given a new purpose. Lined with a brownish mold, the places where the 
bodies of past warriors now hold only multicoloured jars and tools for toxin 
preservation. Grooves have been carved into the wall between the carved 
recesses, once holding the prized possessions of the dead, now they allow for 
more storage space among the cluttered tools and jars. Between the mold and the
fumes from the toxins, an almost visible musty odor cling to the walls of the 
room, and any who would remain here very long. Above, and sometimes below, the 
many recesses in this room are carved images, likely crests or symbols of 
status for the bodies who once resided here in their afterlife. This has been 
marked as holy ground. There are no obvious exits.
[No perfect matches found.]

Aralin releases the clasp on her mask, revealing herself.

You say, in Akrabi, "This is not the proper place for such a procedure, but it will 
do. I can begin testing."

You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "This will not be fast, or painless. Much the 
contrary."

Aralin taps her tail against the ground.

You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "Extend your...appendage."

Jimek Qaqyesil extends his right arm to the side of him, at shoulder level.

You have emoted: Orovan moves closer to Jimek, stone knife firmly gripped in 
hand as he grips the demonic talon with the other. He brings it to Jimek&#39;s arm,
making a small incision as to inspect its composition and sturdiness.

You mutter discontentedly.
Your pose is now: muttering discontentedly.

You say, in Akrabi, "I can see the wound healing quite fast. This filth is 
remarkably sturdy, and it would have to be, to survive a transplant."

You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "Do you recall anything of the original procedure?
I must know some details in order to remove it properly."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I was in pain and delirious at the time."

Aralin Midbere clicks softly in contemplation, regarding the arm with distaste.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I believe he cut my arm with his daegger."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Removed it."

Aralin Midbere says to you, in Akrabi, "It was but a small wound you 
gave...perhaps if I were to try a more serious one?"

Aralin taps her tail against the ground.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Put the other arm in place, and uttered a 
spell for it to... attach."

You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.

You look skeptical and say to Aralin, in Akrabi, "Do go ahead. Hit the arm with
an application of metrazol before you do, however. It may just object to its 
destruction."

The toxin metrazol has been properly prepared.

You carefully take your prepared toxin and pour a single dose of metrazol into 
the vial.

You give a wooden vial to Aralin Midbere.

You say, in Akrabi, "Aim to its center, so it spreads quickly."

Aralin Midbere says, "Restraint may be necessary."

You step forward, hooking your leg around Jimek&#39;s calf while simultaneously 
driving your elbow into his chest and knocking him to the ground.
You quickly flow into the Rizet stance.

In one swift motion, you whip your arm down over Jimek and loose a long dart, 
piercing right through him and pinning him to the ground.

Aralin nods her head.

Aralin Midbere kneels by Jimek&#39;s side and grips the demonic arm firmly, pulling
it straight. Taking the envenomed sitara in her other hand, she swings the 
knife powerfully towards the arm. Narrowing her eyes, she aims to the center of
Jimek&#39;s arm and plunges the sitara forcefully through it.

Jimek winces in pain.

The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.

Aralin Midbere pulls the knife from Jimek&#39;s flesh and regards the wound she&#39;s 
made.

Aralin pokes Jimek harmlessly with the base of her stinger.

Jimek raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "It heals."

Aralin taps her tail against the ground.

You say, in Akrabi, "The metrazol seems to stop the regeneration somewhat, but 
it is noticeable still."


You look skeptical and say, in Akrabi, "This complicates the matter."
You have emoted: Orovan lowers himself to Jimek&#39;s arm, eyeing the point where 
chitin melds with demonic flesh thoroughly. He points to a few marks and before
standing again.

You say, in Akrabi, "The corruption spreads. Severing the source of the taint 
is not enough."

You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.

You say, in Akrabi, "Regardless, we will have to do so to slow the process. We 
will require a blessed weapon."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I have a sabre."

Aralin Midbere says to you, in Akrabi, "Do you think it is possible to purify 
it?"

Jimek Qaqyesil rises slowly, handing Orovan the sabre.

Aralin Midbere rises to her feet as well.

You say, in Akrabi, "A sabre may not be adequate. We may require 
something...larger."

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "An axe, perhaps?"

You nod your head.

You say, in Akrabi, "An axe would be ideal."

You say, in Akrabi, "I will have Delrayne bring us one."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "Delrayne. It seems I do require your aid."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Delrayne says, "Where do you need me Sir?"

A sandstone block in the ceiling rises up slowly and slides across the ceiling 
with a loud grating noise to reveal a spherical chamber above.

Delrayne, riding a savage grey wolf arrives from the up.
A sandstone block slowly slides across the ceiling before dropping into place, 
leaving no evidence that it ever moved.

Delrayne ceases to wield a Spellscourge sitara in his left hand.

Delrayne bows respectfully to you.

Aralin gives Delrayne an acknowledging nod.

Delrayne begins to wield a Spellscourge sitara in his left hand.

You nod your head at Delrayne politely.

You say to Delrayne, in Akrabi, "I need an axe, blessed by the Gods."

You say, in Akrabi, "It is for a...matter most grave."

Aralin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Indeed."

You have emoted: Orovan glaces back at his brother with disgust evident in his 
eyes.

Delrayne Bharathian, the White Hawk says, "Alright, any from Antioch that is 
blessed will do?"

Aralin gives Delrayne an acknowledging nod.

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Go swiftly."

Delrayne Bharathian, the White Hawk says, "I&#39;m on it."

As Delrayne pushes up on a sandstone slab, it rises up slowly then slides 
across the ceiling with a loud grating noise to reveal a spherical chamber 
above.

Delrayne, riding a savage grey wolf leaves to the up.
A sandstone block slowly slides across the ceiling before dropping into place, 
leaving no evidence that it ever moved.

You say, in Akrabi, "Once the arm is severed, we will have to destroy the 
infection."

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Perhaps the Lord will consent to doing so."

You say, in Akrabi, "There may be another way."

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "What do you suggest?"

You say, in Akrabi, "I have been overseeing some experiments in this very 
lab...toxins, quite powerful, but also quite unstable."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Delrayne says, "No one seems to be around that can bless it for 
me."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "Hrm. We may have to be cruder, then."

You have emoted: Orovan wanders towards the several grooves in the wall, 
glancing towards several vials, until he takes one in hand.

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Aralin says, "Perhaps the sabre will have to do."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Delrayne says, "I&#39;m still looking."

You give a blade-tipped glaive to Aralin Midbere.

Aralin taps her tail against the ground.

Aralin begins to wield a blade-tipped glaive in her right hand.

You have emoted: Orovan looks at the vial again, before declaring: "This is a 
compost I have done little testing on. It consists of Veratrum, mixed with 
Xeroderma and Strychnine.".

You say, in Akrabi, "The formula proper is more complicated, of course, but I 
have no time for lengthy explanations."

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "What exactly does it do?"

You say, in Akrabi, "It would, in theory, cause very severe burning in the 
victim&#39;s body, which would be amplified by the strychnine, and use a demoner&#39;s 
essence as fuel for its effect, consuming it completely in the process."

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Shall we try it, then?"

You say to Aralin, in Akrabi, "I am not sure if it would work at this stage. 
Such doses of filth are not common among mortal bodies. It will result in an 
horrible death - but if it heals his body or not, I do not know."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "It must be tried."

Aralin nods her head.

You say, in Akrabi, "It must, indeed."

You say, in Akrabi, "First, the arm."

You say to Aralin, in Akrabi, "Sankug, if you could remove it?"

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "With pleasure."

Aralin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

Aralin steps forward, easily hooking her leg around Jimek&#39;s own and knocking 
him to the ground with a blow to the chest.

Aralin Midbere jabs the blessed glaive experimentally at the joint. Casting a 
disgusted look at Jimek, she mutters, "Be still. This will not be pleasant.".

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Do it."

Aralin Midbere grips the glaive tightly in her hand and begins to hack roughly 
at the demonic arm, severing through flesh and bone.

Jimek curls his nose up and grimaces awfully.

Aralin Midbere grits her teeth as she works to remove the arm, her eyes 
narrowed. Stepping back slightly, she raises the glaive high into the air 
before bringing it down upon the joint powerfully, severing the arm completely 
from Jimek&#39;s body.

Jimek gives a horrified gasp.

The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.

Aralin narrows her eyes to thin slits.

Jimek Qaqyesil nods weakly.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Unpleasant."

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Now quickly, the toxin."

Aralin Midbere takes a step to the side and turns her gaze to Orovan.

You say, in Akrabi, "We must await the daytime. The toxin is partly based on 
xeroderma - as such, it requires the suns to be present."

You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.

Aralin Midbere looks skeptical and says, in Akrabi, "He will bleed to death 
before then."

You say, in Akrabi, "Or perhaps not. Take him outside, I must prepare 
something."

Aralin gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

Aralin beckons Jimek to her.

Jimek Qaqyesil slowly rises to his feet.

+Toxin making Spam, me going outside +

Kinsarmar Road near Cactii Gate. (lost) (City of Antioch.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. This 
has been marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet, 
welded shut. A Justicar of the Shah is manning a cannon here. He has sixty-six 
cannon balls. Jimek Qaqyesil is here. He is holding a banded shield in his left
hand.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, southwest, west, a gently sloped 
ramp leads down, and a set of ornately wrought, massive gates stand to the east
(gate closed) and northwest (gate closed).

The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.

You ponder the situation.

up the proceedure will definitely result in your death."

Being careful not to poison yourself, you wipe off all the toxins from a 
sinuous obsidian knife.

+ I hit him with a bunch of toxins here +

You step in quickly with a slash across Jimek&#39;s torso. ( SITARA LATERAL -&amp;gt; Jimek )
You quickly flow into the Ein-Fasit stance.

Theres arrives from the west.

Aralin nods her head.


Jimek screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.

You rub some cirisosis on a sinuous obsidian knife.

Jimek screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.

Jimek faints and drops to the floor as the last vestiges of his strength are 
drained away.
You have slain Jimek.  &amp;lt;-  Jimek = Owned.
Jimek drops a glittering white mask.

Aralin nods her head.

You pick up the corpse of Jimek.

You give the corpse of Jimek to Aralin Midbere.

You say to Aralin, "Into the Demon&#39;s gate, to be sure."

Aralin gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

Aralin Midbere says to you, in Akrabi, "You have the...appendage?"

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Burn that as well, I say."

Aralin Midbere clicks.

You say to Aralin, "I have left it in the laboratory."

You shake your head.

You say, "It will be stored, so that others may see how utterly disgusting it 
is."

Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Very well. I will be at the Gate."

You nod your head.

Aralin tells you, in Akrabi, "I trust we will take revenge."

You tell Aralin Midbere, in Akrabi, "Of course. I do not tolerate such a 
shame."

You tell Aralin Midbere, in Akrabi, "Gather the arm, and place it in an 
appropriate container. It may be of use yet."

Aralin tells you, in Akrabi, "Aye."

You sent the following message to Alitis: I&#39;m in my labz, destroying ur 
handiworkz.'>You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "We must speak. Immediately."
Jimek begins to follow you.
Jimek raises an eyebrow at you.
You say to a masked woman, in Akrabi, "Sankug, I wish you to come as well."
A masked woman gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "My shame is my own."
You say, in Akrabi, "I care little about your 'shame'. Reveal it."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "You have my answer."
Jimek ceases to wield a hard-edge broadsword in his left hand.
Jimek takes up a banded shield in his left hand.
Jimek ceases to wield a banded shield in his right hand.
Jimek takes up a banded shield in his right hand.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I'll not willingly shame myself."
You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "I will say it once again. Reveal it, or I will
lock you in a salvation chamber, and you will endure far bigger pains than
shame."
You say, in Akrabi, "I am quite aware of what has happened to you..."
You spit on the ground in disgust.
A masked woman says, in Akrabi, "Why has happened?"
A masked woman says, in Akrabi, "What, rather."
Jimek nods his head.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I was taken."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "My arm removed."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "And replaced with this."
Jimek Qaqyesil eyes his covered arm in disgust.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "You need not see it."
Dist tells you, in Akrabi, "I must depart."
A masked woman narrows her eyes to thin slits.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "And it is my own problem."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I will handle it as I see fit."
A masked woman snorts arrogantly.
Dist grows still and his lips begin to move silently.
Dist nods his head politely.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Anything else is not fitting of a Manoan, nor
an Illuminai."
You say, in Akrabi, "It is no such thing."
You say, in Akrabi, "You have been tainted, Jimek, and hiding that fact
indicates one thing only."
A masked woman says to Jimek, in Akrabi, "It is more than your problem - you
taint the Order of the Pure with your ...deformity."
A masked woman clicks and chitters angrily.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I was deformed by my own weakness."
You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "You no longer have a say in what you do or not
regarding it. From now on, we will handle this."
Jimek clicks and chitters in agitation.
You say, in Akrabi, "Until we bring you salvation, you are, much to my shame,
nothing but filith."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Choose your next words wisely."
A masked woman smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I wished no help."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "If you insist, I will allow you to do as you
will."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "But I am afraid, I am -not- filth."
You say, in Akrabi, "Your...arm taints your whole. You may ask for no help, but
you require it, desperately."
Jimek Qaqyesil bows his head and sighs to himself. Raising his head, he nods.
Jimek Qaqyesil pulls back his robe, and reveals his deformed arm.
A masked woman eyes Jimek's arm with disgust.
You have emoted: Orovan moves closer to Jimek, eyeing the torn, demonic arm
with suspicion, and he mutters, half to himself, "I do not know why you thought
I would not know of this. I have ears and eyes everywhere...this delay does
nothing but shame you, and me by association.".
You say, in Akrabi, "This will require better tools."
A masked woman gives you a nod of acknowledgement.
A musty laboratory. (Nowhere.?)
Appearing to have long ago been the catacombs for those granted a prestigious
rank within an organization, the sandstone walls of this room have deep
recesses carved into them. Underground scavengers, likely locusts, have long
ago cleared the previous occupants of this room away, the room itself has now
been given a new purpose. Lined with a brownish mold, the places where the
bodies of past warriors now hold only multicoloured jars and tools for toxin
preservation. Grooves have been carved into the wall between the carved
recesses, once holding the prized possessions of the dead, now they allow for
more storage space among the cluttered tools and jars. Between the mold and the
fumes from the toxins, an almost visible musty odor cling to the walls of the
room, and any who would remain here very long. Above, and sometimes below, the
many recesses in this room are carved images, likely crests or symbols of
status for the bodies who once resided here in their afterlife. This has been
marked as holy ground. There are no obvious exits.
[No perfect matches found.]
Aralin releases the clasp on her mask, revealing herself.
You say, in Akrabi, "This is not the proper place for such a procedure, but it will
do. I can begin testing."
You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "This will not be fast, or painless. Much the
contrary."
Aralin taps her tail against the ground.
You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "Extend your...appendage."
Jimek Qaqyesil extends his right arm to the side of him, at shoulder level.
You have emoted: Orovan moves closer to Jimek, stone knife firmly gripped in
hand as he grips the demonic talon with the other. He brings it to Jimek's arm,
making a small incision as to inspect its composition and sturdiness.
You mutter discontentedly.
Your pose is now: muttering discontentedly.
You say, in Akrabi, "I can see the wound healing quite fast. This filth is
remarkably sturdy, and it would have to be, to survive a transplant."
You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "Do you recall anything of the original procedure?
I must know some details in order to remove it properly."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I was in pain and delirious at the time."
Aralin Midbere clicks softly in contemplation, regarding the arm with distaste.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I believe he cut my arm with his daegger."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Removed it."
Aralin Midbere says to you, in Akrabi, "It was but a small wound you
gave...perhaps if I were to try a more serious one?"
Aralin taps her tail against the ground.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Put the other arm in place, and uttered a
spell for it to... attach."
You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.
You look skeptical and say to Aralin, in Akrabi, "Do go ahead. Hit the arm with
an application of metrazol before you do, however. It may just object to its
destruction."
The toxin metrazol has been properly prepared.
You carefully take your prepared toxin and pour a single dose of metrazol into
the vial.
You give a wooden vial to Aralin Midbere.
You say, in Akrabi, "Aim to its center, so it spreads quickly."
Aralin Midbere says, "Restraint may be necessary."
You step forward, hooking your leg around Jimek's calf while simultaneously
driving your elbow into his chest and knocking him to the ground.
You quickly flow into the Rizet stance.
In one swift motion, you whip your arm down over Jimek and loose a long dart,
piercing right through him and pinning him to the ground.
Aralin nods her head.
Aralin Midbere kneels by Jimek's side and grips the demonic arm firmly, pulling
it straight. Taking the envenomed sitara in her other hand, she swings the
knife powerfully towards the arm. Narrowing her eyes, she aims to the center of
Jimek's arm and plunges the sitara forcefully through it.
Jimek winces in pain.
The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.
Aralin Midbere pulls the knife from Jimek's flesh and regards the wound she's
made.
Aralin pokes Jimek harmlessly with the base of her stinger.
Jimek raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "It heals."
Aralin taps her tail against the ground.
You say, in Akrabi, "The metrazol seems to stop the regeneration somewhat, but
it is noticeable still."
You look skeptical and say, in Akrabi, "This complicates the matter."
You have emoted: Orovan lowers himself to Jimek's arm, eyeing the point where
chitin melds with demonic flesh thoroughly. He points to a few marks and before
standing again.
You say, in Akrabi, "The corruption spreads. Severing the source of the taint
is not enough."
You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.
You say, in Akrabi, "Regardless, we will have to do so to slow the process. We
will require a blessed weapon."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "I have a sabre."
Aralin Midbere says to you, in Akrabi, "Do you think it is possible to purify
it?"
Jimek Qaqyesil rises slowly, handing Orovan the sabre.
Aralin Midbere rises to her feet as well.
You say, in Akrabi, "A sabre may not be adequate. We may require
something...larger."
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "An axe, perhaps?"
You nod your head.
You say, in Akrabi, "An axe would be ideal."
You say, in Akrabi, "I will have Delrayne bring us one."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "Delrayne. It seems I do require your aid."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Delrayne says, "Where do you need me Sir?"
A sandstone block in the ceiling rises up slowly and slides across the ceiling
with a loud grating noise to reveal a spherical chamber above.
Delrayne, riding a savage grey wolf arrives from the up.
A sandstone block slowly slides across the ceiling before dropping into place,
leaving no evidence that it ever moved.
Delrayne ceases to wield a Spellscourge sitara in his left hand.
Delrayne bows respectfully to you.
Aralin gives Delrayne an acknowledging nod.
Delrayne begins to wield a Spellscourge sitara in his left hand.
You nod your head at Delrayne politely.
You say to Delrayne, in Akrabi, "I need an axe, blessed by the Gods."
You say, in Akrabi, "It is for a...matter most grave."
Aralin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Indeed."
You have emoted: Orovan glaces back at his brother with disgust evident in his
eyes.
Delrayne Bharathian, the White Hawk says, "Alright, any from Antioch that is
blessed will do?"
Aralin gives Delrayne an acknowledging nod.
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Go swiftly."
Delrayne Bharathian, the White Hawk says, "I'm on it."
As Delrayne pushes up on a sandstone slab, it rises up slowly then slides
across the ceiling with a loud grating noise to reveal a spherical chamber
above.
Delrayne, riding a savage grey wolf leaves to the up.
A sandstone block slowly slides across the ceiling before dropping into place,
leaving no evidence that it ever moved.
You say, in Akrabi, "Once the arm is severed, we will have to destroy the
infection."
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Perhaps the Lord will consent to doing so."
You say, in Akrabi, "There may be another way."
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "What do you suggest?"
You say, in Akrabi, "I have been overseeing some experiments in this very
lab...toxins, quite powerful, but also quite unstable."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Delrayne says, "No one seems to be around that can bless it for
me."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "Hrm. We may have to be cruder, then."
You have emoted: Orovan wanders towards the several grooves in the wall,
glancing towards several vials, until he takes one in hand.
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Aralin says, "Perhaps the sabre will have to do."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Abhaen&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Delrayne says, "I'm still looking."
You give a blade-tipped glaive to Aralin Midbere.
Aralin taps her tail against the ground.
Aralin begins to wield a blade-tipped glaive in her right hand.
You have emoted: Orovan looks at the vial again, before declaring: "This is a
compost I have done little testing on. It consists of Veratrum, mixed with
Xeroderma and Strychnine.".
You say, in Akrabi, "The formula proper is more complicated, of course, but I
have no time for lengthy explanations."
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "What exactly does it do?"
You say, in Akrabi, "It would, in theory, cause very severe burning in the
victim's body, which would be amplified by the strychnine, and use a demoner's
essence as fuel for its effect, consuming it completely in the process."
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Shall we try it, then?"
You say to Aralin, in Akrabi, "I am not sure if it would work at this stage.
Such doses of filth are not common among mortal bodies. It will result in an
horrible death - but if it heals his body or not, I do not know."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "It must be tried."
Aralin nods her head.
You say, in Akrabi, "It must, indeed."
You say, in Akrabi, "First, the arm."
You say to Aralin, in Akrabi, "Sankug, if you could remove it?"
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "With pleasure."
Aralin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.
Aralin steps forward, easily hooking her leg around Jimek's own and knocking
him to the ground with a blow to the chest.
Aralin Midbere jabs the blessed glaive experimentally at the joint. Casting a
disgusted look at Jimek, she mutters, "Be still. This will not be pleasant.".
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Do it."
Aralin Midbere grips the glaive tightly in her hand and begins to hack roughly
at the demonic arm, severing through flesh and bone.
Jimek curls his nose up and grimaces awfully.
Aralin Midbere grits her teeth as she works to remove the arm, her eyes
narrowed. Stepping back slightly, she raises the glaive high into the air
before bringing it down upon the joint powerfully, severing the arm completely
from Jimek's body.
Jimek gives a horrified gasp.
The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.
Aralin narrows her eyes to thin slits.
Jimek Qaqyesil nods weakly.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Unpleasant."
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Now quickly, the toxin."
Aralin Midbere takes a step to the side and turns her gaze to Orovan.
You say, in Akrabi, "We must await the daytime. The toxin is partly based on
xeroderma - as such, it requires the suns to be present."
You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.
Aralin Midbere looks skeptical and says, in Akrabi, "He will bleed to death
before then."
You say, in Akrabi, "Or perhaps not. Take him outside, I must prepare
something."
Aralin gives you a nod of acknowledgement.
Aralin beckons Jimek to her.
Jimek Qaqyesil slowly rises to his feet.
+Toxin making Spam, me going outside +
Kinsarmar Road near Cactii Gate. (lost) (City of Antioch.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. This
has been marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet,
welded shut. A Justicar of the Shah is manning a cannon here. He has sixty-six
cannon balls. Jimek Qaqyesil is here. He is holding a banded shield in his left
hand.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, southwest, west, a gently sloped
ramp leads down, and a set of ornately wrought, massive gates stand to the east
(gate closed) and northwest (gate closed).
The segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.
You ponder the situation.
Your pose is now: pondering.
&amp;lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w &amp;lt;eb&amp;gt; &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0&amp;gt; l
You say to Jimek, in Akrabi, "You will want to inform the Holy City. Speeding
up the proceedure will definitely result in your death."
(Antioch): Jimek says, "Ignore my death."
Being careful not to poison yourself, you wipe off all the toxins from a
sinuous obsidian knife.
+ I hit him with a bunch of toxins here +
You step in quickly with a slash across Jimek's torso. ( SITARA LATERAL -&amp;gt; Jimek )
You quickly flow into the Ein-Fasit stance.
Theres arrives from the west.
Aralin nods her head.
Jimek screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.
You rub some cirisosis on a sinuous obsidian knife.
Jimek screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.
Jimek faints and drops to the floor as the last vestiges of his strength are
drained away.
You have slain Jimek. &amp;lt;- Jimek = Owned.
Jimek drops a glittering white mask.
Aralin nods her head.
You pick up the corpse of Jimek.
You give the corpse of Jimek to Aralin Midbere.
You say to Aralin, "Into the Demon's gate, to be sure."
Aralin gives you a nod of acknowledgement.
Aralin Midbere says to you, in Akrabi, "You have the...appendage?"
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Burn that as well, I say."
Aralin Midbere clicks.
You say to Aralin, "I have left it in the laboratory."
You shake your head.
You say, "It will be stored, so that others may see how utterly disgusting it
is."
Aralin Midbere says, in Akrabi, "Very well. I will be at the Gate."
You nod your head.
Aralin tells you, in Akrabi, "I trust we will take revenge."
You tell Aralin Midbere, in Akrabi, "Of course. I do not tolerate such a
shame."
You tell Aralin Midbere, in Akrabi, "Gather the arm, and place it in an
appropriate container. It may be of use yet."
Aralin tells you, in Akrabi, "Aye."
