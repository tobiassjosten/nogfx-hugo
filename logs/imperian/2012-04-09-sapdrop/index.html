Entering Monarch Square.
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. As wide as a tree trunk and as tall as a horse, a heart-shaped rock has been placed here, awaiting those who would test their strength. A small silvery stone is here, surrounded in haze. Arching up towards the sky, with a curtain of shifting light hung within it, the Lunar Pylon stands proudly here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A majestic clockwork tree with a gleaming copper trunk, with various metals that comprise the outward reaching branches that mimic the growth of a living tree. A sinewy snake rushes through the waters. Marinthya, the Festival Merchant hums cheerily as she warmly beckons you towards her myriad wares. A massive bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands of foam hanging from its muzzle. A shrouded spore-thrower is manning a cannon here. He has ninety-nine cannon balls. A little fawn-coloured dog with an ugly wrinkled face is here wagging her curly tail happily. Calmly gazing upon her surroundings with ice blue eyes, a healthy white mare stands here upon strong legs. Twin swords crossing his back, Captain Josheba Amthus stands here, patrolling the Council. The effects of this location have been twisted under a demonic influence.

Entering Monarch Square.
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. As wide as a tree trunk and as tall as a horse, a heart-shaped rock has been placed here, awaiting those who would test their strength. A small silvery stone is here, surrounded in haze. Arching up towards the sky, with a curtain of shifting light hung within it, the Lunar Pylon stands proudly here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A majestic clockwork tree with a gleaming copper trunk, with various metals that comprise the outward reaching branches that mimic the growth of a living tree. A sinewy snake rushes through the waters. Marinthya, the Festival Merchant hums cheerily as she warmly beckons you towards her myriad wares. A massive bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands of foam hanging from its muzzle. A shrouded spore-thrower is manning a cannon here. He has ninety-nine cannon balls. A little fawn-coloured dog with an ugly wrinkled face is here wagging her curly tail happily. Calmly gazing upon her surroundings with ice blue eyes, a healthy white mare stands here upon strong legs. Twin swords crossing his back, Captain Josheba Amthus stands here, patrolling the Council. The effects of this location have been twisted under a demonic influence.
You see exits leading north, east, south, southwest, west, and northwest.
