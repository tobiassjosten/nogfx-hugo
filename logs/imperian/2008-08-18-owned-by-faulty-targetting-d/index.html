Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stone, a grey mist 
surrounds its ethereal light, which is known to be a source of inspiration and 
life. A plain metal bench rests upon the ground here. A well-carved statue of 
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of 
utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in 
ruin here. A plain metal chest rests upon the ground here. A detailed statue of
light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the 
throes of feeble rage. A small sign points into a market stall. A meticulous 
marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx 
pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately
carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking
to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its
mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. A sleek 
black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Alitis Nessaja is here, 
hidden. He wields a chained sitara in his left hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
