I am issuing in regards to blatant exploits of the achievement system and kill farming. Just now, about twenty minutes ago Dias paid five people (Krystal, Vierra, Komatata, Samoria and Akiel) 10 credits a piece so that he could kill them and receive an achievement unjustly. A day or two ago, Dias also paid Fitz to allow him to repeatedly slay Fitz at the spring to receive the rez bonus achiement. These are far from the only documented times he has abused the system to receive unearned credit. He has gained innumerable amounts of benefits such as experience bonuses, experience in itself and PK rank through channels they were never intended to be had and would take other players weeks to fairlytake advantage of.( You tell Sir Dias Tethe&#39;alla, Rogue of Aetherius, "Did you pay them?"Dias tells you, "Aye."Dias tells you, "Why>."You tell Sir Dias Tethe&#39;alla, Rogue of Aetherius, "How much?"Dias tells you, "10 credits each, I&#39;m not cheap.") (You tell Sir Dias Tethe&#39;alla, Rogue of Aetherius, "You paid Fitz yesterday too to get the rez bonus?"Dias tells you, "That was about a week
ago.")

I am not exploiting anything. If Avasyu states within the achievement system 
that you may not pay people to die, then fine, I won&#39;t. There was no abuse 
meant. Fitz AGREED to die and I paid him as per the agreement. As did all the others. I honestly do not care about the &#39;instant exp&#39; or the &#39;exp bonus&#39; anymore. I had an EXP bonus that was vast for about a day and I used it. I have no intentions of &#39;abusing the system for PK ranks&#39; because lets face it, at the PK level I am currently at, the said people (Vierra, Fitz, Komatata, Akiel, Samoria, and Krystal) offer nearly nothing to my %. I am not sure what Kephas&#39; player is trying to point out here since I am not exploiting anything. These achievements are set for the players to get, and they choose how to get them. It is like on the XBOX I would say, if you need an item or a certain thing, you will pay or trade for it. I have nothing needed from trade, so I pay. Dias paidthose five people, and I did do it for the achievement. It was the only way I saw it viable for a RUNEGUARD to get 5 kills in 5 seconds. It is feasibly impossible otherwise. I paid Fitz to allow me to slay him and rezz him for the submerge bonus, yes. I wanted to have a large bonus for the day I decided to hunt a lot. Note, this only gave a 100% of the 1100% that I earned through my owns means and no other players help. Currently it is highly unlikely that I will be able to win this achievement quest since I am not good enough in many aspects of a FFA.
