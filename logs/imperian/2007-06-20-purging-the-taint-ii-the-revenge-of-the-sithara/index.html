people are going to prism in, one of your leaders will say you have to kill me,
then I&#39;ll die and be back in Stavenn for supper."

You shall now speak in Common.
A wind far above causes thick cloud to obscure the Triple Eclipse, yet even 
through that billowing veil, the triple circle of the unified moons shines 
through.

Lord Alitis Valstivar says, "So, how about we skip the middleman and just get 
on with the killing, hm?"

Jimek whips his tail around, segments clicking loudly, and slaps Alitis in the 
face with it.

You say, "I do not make an habit of repeating the same mistake twice. And as 
for you, you will speak when I order you to do so."

A masked man&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

The chamber of salvation. (Nowhere.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Located
far below the sweltering heat of the desert, this chamber has a damp and dreary
air to it. The stone walls are perfectly circular, though the faultless 
sandstone is marred by ritualistic symbols scrawled haphazardly across it in 
what appears to be blood. Two lone torches adorn the walls opposite one 
another, held in place by blackened steel. They cast most of the chamber in a 
dim, eerie light, while the rest is left in shadow. Unsettling reddish-brown 
stains can be seen on the stone floor, and long forgotten bones have been 
heaped to one side, adding a disturbing feel to the gloomy room. This has been 
marked as holy ground. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces 
here, padding softly back and forth. Jimek Qaqyesil is here, giving off a truly
ghastly stench. He holds a buckler in each hand. Aralin Midbere is here. She 
wields a tower shield in her left hand and a jagged black sitara in her right. 
Lord Alitis Valstivar is here, sprawled on the ground.
You see a single exit leading north.

Nuvantes releases the clasp on his mask, revealing himself.

Alitis grins mischievously.

Lord Alitis Valstivar asks, "You really think you can order a noble of the 
Imperium around?"

You quietly step up behind Alitis, bringing the pommel of your sitara to bear 
and cracking it across the base of his skull in one deft movement.

Alitis suddenly regains consciousness.

With lightning speed Jimek strikes Alitis&#39;s head with a devastating shield 
attack.

You say, "As I said: Do not talk unless ordered."

Jimek gives Alitis the once over.

Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil says to Alitis, "You are no more a noble than a rat."

You gag a bit as Jimek&#39;s stink wafts over you.

Lord Alitis Valstivar says, "Well... that was somewhat painful... can&#39;t say I 
haven&#39;t experienced worse."

You say to Aralin, "Gag him. I grow tired of his ramblings."

Lord Alitis Valstivar asks Nuvantes, "Oh come now... do you really think I kill
Antiochans just because I&#39;m in the mood for it?"

Lord Alitis Valstivar says, "Well... actually I do sometimes... but that&#39;s not 
the point."

(Antioch): You say, "If any of you wishes to watch, I believe it would prove to
be an entertaining event."

(Antioch): Kira says, "..."

Aralin Midbere takes a piece of cloth in her hand and ties it roughly about 
Alitis&#39; mouth, effectively gagging him.

Alitis glares angrily at Aralin.

Jimek smirks.

Aralin&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind her.

You say, "Much better. Very well, then. Now that he is silenced, we may begin."

Lord Alitis Valstivar tries to respond, but due to the gag, does nothing more 
than utter a series of incomprehensible noises.

Aralin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Obedient, as well as charming."

Alitis creases his brow in a frown.

You tell Epiphany, Goddess of Life, "We have, yes."

Lord Alitis Valstivar attempts to lash out, but finds himself held in place, 
unable to move.

You say, "Firstly, we will start by restraining his movements. While the webs 
serve that purpose to a point, they are not as effective, and quite honestly, 
not as amusing as broken limbs."

Alitis rolls his eyes.

You say to Jimek, "So, if you will, Brother?"

You nudge Jimek with your smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.

Jimek ceases to wield a buckler in his left hand.

Jimek takes up a buckler in his left hand.

Jimek ceases to wield a buckler in his right hand.

Jimek takes up a buckler in his right hand.

Lord Alitis Valstivar mutters, "Anti....ns... no imaginat..n when it ...es .. 
.orture..."
Jimek lunges and strikes Alitis&#39;s arm, which instantly goes limp.
Jimek lunges and strikes Alitis&#39;s arm, which instantly goes limp.
Jimek thrusts his blade into Alitis&#39;s leg, which gives way beneath him.
Jimek thrusts his blade into Alitis&#39;s leg, which gives way beneath him.

Aralin nods her head.

You say, "Excellent. Now that he is restrained, we will begin the 
more...&#39;creative&#39; part."

Lord Alitis Valstivar mutters, "Like ... .an ca... .e pain I ha....t alrea.. 
.elt."

You say to Aralin, "If you have the tools with you?"

Aralin Midbere says, "An application of strychnine first, perhaps?"

You say to Aralin, "Of course."

Aralin carefully wipes all the toxins off of a jagged black sitara.

You say, "The strychnine will, of course, enhance his pain multifold, and 
hopefully make the only sounds to leave his mouth in the near future be screams
of agony."

You say to Aralin, "A high dosage, if you will."

Nuvantes smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Parter arrives from the north.

With a flourish of his arm, Parter bows deeply.

You nod your head at Parter politely.

Aralin Midbere kneels down by Alitis and carves her sitara across his torso, 
ensuring the toxin enters his bloodstream.

Alitis winces in pain.

You whisper to Parter, "If you could sit down and watch? This will be a 
complicate procedure."

Parter sits down.

You nod your head.

Aralin Midbere presses the blade of her knife under Alitis&#39; chin, just hard 
enough to draw a thin trickle of blood. Leaning foward, she whispers coldly, 
"You will beg for death before we are done.".

You say, "Very good. Let us see if the toxin has entered his bloodstream, 
then."

Lord Alitis Valstivar closes his eyes and starts chanting under his breath, 
although the gag fouls his words and he keeps on starting over.

Aralin narrows her eyes at Alitis in an unnerving manner.

A sudden wind whips through the wind as the temperature begins to plummet 
rapidly. Plumes of your breath begin to form in the coldness.

You have emoted: Orovan moves closer to Alitis&#39; restrained form, and grasps one
of his arms, reversing the grip on his stone sitara and piercing the demonic 
implement deeply, before roughly moving it towards the joint, cutting deeply in
the process.

Lord Alitis Valstivar shudders in pain, but keeps going with his chanting, 
desperately trying to maintain concentration throught the pain.

Aralin Midbere says to Alitis, "Be silent."

A low, gutteral whispering echoes throughout the room, slowly increasing to a 
maddening chorus of chaotic voices.

You say to Jimek, "Your shields. Batter his head."

Thrusting forward, Jimek brings his shield crashing into Alitis.
Diving forward, Jimek bashes his shield into Alitis.

You say, "Enough."

Jimek gives Alitis the once over.

Jimek nods his head.

Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil says, "I will ensure his silence."

You say to Nuvantes, "Terminate his chatter. Permanently."

Lord Alitis Valstivar chants louder and louder, though the words are coming out
garbled due to the injuries inflicted.

With a dry hiss, Aralin raises her venomous tail in warning at Alitis.

A sudden blackness descends upon the room as the torches flicker low with a 
howling wind before slowly regaining their brief gasps of light. Shadows 
seemingly disengage from each corner, wavering menacingly.

You quietly step up behind Alitis, bringing the pommel of your sitara to bear 
and cracking it across the base of his skull in one deft movement.

Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil leans over to Alitis&#39; restrained body, and removes his
gag. As Alitis starts to chant more, but Nuvantes quickly thrusts his hand into
his mouth, draws out his tongue, and taking his sitara in hand, slices it off.

You say to Alitis, "You dare to try and taint this Holy place? Oh, you will 
suffer for it. Far, far more than you imagine."

Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil says to Alitis, "The only sound you will make now, are
screams."

The temperature continues to decrease as a thin layer of frost begins to form 
on your surroundings.

Alitis utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

Aralin squints suspiciously at her surroundings.

Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil throws the tongue of Alitis to the ground, where it 
sits in a pool of blood.

You have emoted: Orovan eyes his surroundings with some unease, unused to and 
surprised by such temperatures in the heart of Antioch.

Jimek taps his tail against the ground.

You tap your tail against the ground.

Lord Alitis Valstivar grins a little, as if knowing something that those 
standing around him don&#39;t, as blood pools around his lips and drips onto the 
ground.

You say, "This is nothing. We will coninue."

You look skeptical and say to Aralin, "The tools. Immediately."

Tendrils of fog emanate from each corner, thickening  as they slowly encircle 
the form of Alitis. A sudden wailing emits across the room, nearly deafening 
you.

Alitis cackles hellishly.

Jimek peers about himself unscrupulously.

With a dry hiss, you raise your tail in warning at Alitis, the barb at its tip 
glistening dangerously.

Aralin Midbere produces a few needles from her satchel and offers them to 
Orovan.

Suddenly the room is plunged into darkness as you feel shadowy forms brushing 
against you.

Aralin snarls viciously.

Nuvantes almost casually steps up behind Alitis and smashes the pommel of his 
sitara across the back of his head.

Alitis suddenly regains consciousness.

With a dry hiss, Jimek raises his venomous tail in warning.

You yell, "You scare no-one, filth!"

Lord Alitis Valstivar tries to talk, but with his tongue cut out, it only comes
out a garbled mess closely resembling the phrase "too late".

You say to Alitis, "No, no..."

You have emoted: Orovan smirks broadly.

You nudge Aralin with your smooth, segmented tail, urging her to proceed.

Soft whisperings echo near your ear in a gutteral, dark language reminiscent of
a deep chuckling as the fog begins to swirl in every widening circles across 
the room.

Lord Alitis Valstivar turns his gaze upon the Triple Eclipse above, a satisfied
grin on his face.

You say, "Continue your work. This will not hinder us. He is not a threat."

Aralin Midbere kneels by Alitis&#39; head, and takes a thin knife in her hand, 
dangling it almost tauntingly infront of his eyes. With a smirk, she places a 
hand on his face and forces his right eye open. "Now...you will scream.".

Alitis smirks.

You have emoted: Orovan chitters angrily, motioning for those around him to 
speed up their tasks, as he states: I will return shortly. He will not leave 
until he has been given what I brought him here for.

+ I move in and out here +

Aralin shoves the blade into Alitis&#39; eye socket and slowly severs his eye 
from his head, watching as the blood pools forth.

An inhuman scream of agony pierces the air, echoing throughout the City as it 
slowly fades away.

You have emoted: Orovan returns to the room with a displeased grimace, a 
covered vial tightly gripped in his hand.

Aralin Midbere takes up the severed eye in her hand and licks the blood off of 
it, a grim but satisfied expression on her face.

Lord Alitis Valstivar cries out in pain, but retains his composure somewhat. He
lets his head drop over to the side and lets the blood trickle across the 
ground towards his arm.

(Antioch): Silken says, "What now?"

(Antioch): Kira says, "For the love of the Divine."

(Antioch): Kalima says, "What was that scream?"

(Antioch): Draven says, "What scream?"

(Antioch): Kalima says, "You didnt hear it?"

(Antioch): Draven says, "Must be centered in Antioch, I&#39;m in Nirvana."

(Antioch): Kalima says, "An inhuman scream of agony pierces the air, echoing 
throughout the City as it slowly fades away."

(Antioch): Draven says, "Pilg home."

(Antioch): Kalima says, "Is what I heard.."

(Antioch): Silken says, "Ah, nevermind."

(Antioch): Silken says, "It may appear inhuman, but it is very very human."

(Antioch): Kalima says, "Aye?"

(Pkmn): Jimek says, "I think it&#39;s some demon."

(Pkmn): Jimek says, "That Alitis has."

(Antioch): Jace says, "They must have began the torture."

(Antioch): Kalima says, ".."

(Antioch): Kalima says, "Which?"

(Antioch): You say, "Alitis is currently in our grasp, though he is trying his 
best not to be."

Aralin Midbere nudges Parter foward with her tail, casting her gaze towards the
boy. "You will remove the second one." With a faint smirk, she hands Parter the
knife.

(Antioch): Kalima says, "Ah, I see. so nothing for me to worry about then, 
yes?"

(Antioch): You say, "Indeed."

A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room.  &amp;lt;-  PRISM.

Draven suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.

You shall now speak in Akrabi.

(Antioch): Aralin says, "He merely objected to me removing his eye, that is 
all. Nothing to worry yourselves over."

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says, "Interesting. I never knew
this demoner could hit a soprano."

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says, "Good work."

(Antioch): Jace says, "Oh ok."

You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.

Alitis glares angrily at Draven.

Aralin nudges Parter with her smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.

You say to Draven, in Akrabi, "I would have appreciated a warning, though you 
are not unwelcome."

Shadows converge over Alitis, swirling slowly as a dark glow begins to emit 
from its surroundings.

Jimek taps his tail against the ground.

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to you, "My apologies. 
What&#39;s going on with him?"

Jimek Qaqyesil says to Alitis, "You begin to anger me, scum."

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide gestures towards the shadows.

You say to Draven, in Akrabi, "He was able to cast some sort of spell before 
his tongue was permanently removed. These will not linger after we terminate 
him, though."

Lord Alitis Valstivar focuses intently on the blood coming out of his removed 
eye, and as it nears his hand, he discreetly dips one of his talons in the 
blood and begins drawing something into the ground.

Aralin whips her tail around, segments clicking loudly, and slaps Alitis in the
face with it.

Alitis smirks.

Aralin Midbere rolls the severed eye in her palm, smiling wryly.

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to you, in Akrabi, "Oh, 
they need not last at all. Allow me to demonstrate how easily the pure light of
our ways can banish such mere darkness."

Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil take his sitara, and whips it through Alitis&#39; hand, 
ceasing his drawing.

Throwing back his head, Alitis screams agonizingly.

You hear the low snarling of an unknown creature emit from the fog as the dark 
glowing intensifies.

Draven blinks.

You tap your tail against the ground.

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to you, in Akrabi, "Oh, not
some normal darkness?"

You nod your acknowledgement of Draven.

Parter severs alitis&#39; second eye.

(Pkmn): You say, "Cute."

(Pkmn): Nuvantes says, "Hahaha."

Aralin gives Parter an acknowledging nod.

(SB): You say, "At least he tried."

Jimek Qaqyesil kneels by Alitis&#39; side, and whispers in his ear.

Jimek whispers something to Alitis.

You say, "Very well, then. It is time."

You say to Alitis, "I have a gift of sorts, for you."

Alitis raises an eyebrow at you.

Blood pools across the room near Alitis in thick, crimson masses as it begins 
to slowly move across the room.

Aralin narrows her eyes to thin slits.

You tap your tail against the ground.

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide glances curiously towards 
Orovan.

You shall now speak in Akrabi.

You exclaim, in Akrabi, "Restrain him! I am not done!"

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to you, in Akrabi, "Should 
I bless this room?"

You shall now speak in Common.

Lord Alitis Valstivar closes his eyes in intense concentration, letting more 
blood seep out of his eyes.

You say to Alitis, "You will see for yourself, filth."

Droplets of blood move seemingly of their own accord as a pentagram slowly 
begins to form of its own. Each ragged line crossing another.

You say to Alitis, "You are fond of experiments, but I have my own."

Draven stands with arms outstretched, his mouth moving rapidly in fervent 
prayer to the Lord of the Seven Suns.

Jimek snorts arrogantly.

Pure strands of light weave themselves together before Draven, and within 
seconds he holds a spiritual mace within his grasp.

Draven begins to wield a spiritual mace in his left hand.

Draven takes up a tower shield in his right hand.

Jimek Qaqyesil says, "Show yourself, scum."

Lord Alitis Valstivar turns his head towards Orovan, and opens his empty eye 
sockets again.

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide grimaces is mild disgust at 
Alitis&#39; visage.

You have emoted: Orovan takes the vial in his hand, and roughly removes the 
cover, eyeing Alitis&#39; battered form.

Jimek whispers to you, "There is little doubt in my mind he is attempting to 
summon a type of demon to assist him."

You say to Alitis, "This is a toxin compost I have created...and it will assure
that you do not conduct any experiments on yourself ever again."

Alitis raises an eyebrow questioningly.

You see a burst of fire explode from the completed pentagram, flaring upwards 
towards the ceiling before slowly burning within the contained area.

Alitis utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

You click and chitter angrily.

Jimek clicks and chitters angrily.

You have emoted: Orovan quickly makes his way towards Alitis, gripping him 
tightly and forcing the vial&#39;s contents into his open wounds.

You say to Alitis, "It is a compost, filth. Xeroderma and Veratrum, designed to
use the victim&#39;s own demonic energies against him, and purge him of them. 
Permanently."

You smirk.
Your pose is now: smirking smugly.

Aralin&#39;s deadly tail sways slowly behind her.

You say, "You should feel the effects soon enough."

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide closes his eyes and raises his 
arms towards the ceiling, whispering prayers to the Lord of the Suns.

Suddenly the fire is snuffed out completely as an equally blinding white light 
explodes across the room as the temperature raises drastically.

Aralin Midbere says to Alitis, "You will be purged in the name of the Pure."

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide lowers his eyes towards the form
of Alitis, a satisfied smile upon his face.

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to Alitis, in Akrabi, "Your
powers....are as bugs beneath the feet of the Gods."

You say to Alitis, "So, you see...your efforts here are laughable. You will be 
Pure of body, forcefully."

Lord Alitis Valstivar opens his empty sockets wide, suddenly fear is evident 
upon his features, as if whatever he was trying has backfired.

Torches flare to life as the thick fog is burned away, exposing the room.

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide closes his eyes and lowers his 
hands to the floor, laying further blessings of holy power within the room.

Draven enacts the Rite of Banishment, calling upon the Lord of the Seven Suns 
to make this holy ground anathema to the demonic ones.

You say, in Akrabi, "Prepare him! I will induce toxin shock to speed up the 
process."

You nudge Nuvantes with your smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.

Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says, in Akrabi, "I must 
depart..but this prayer shall hold fast. I hope."

Aralin gives Draven an acknowledging nod.

Jimek rakes the jagged edge of a buckler at Alitis.
Alitis&#39;s right leg suddenly goes limp.
 
Jimek chops at Alitis with the edge of a buckler.
Alitis&#39;s right arm suddenly goes limp.

Lord Alitis Valstivar vainly struggles to free himself, trying to get away and 
preserve what he worked so hard to achieve.

Jimek slices at Alitis with the sharpened edge of a buckler.
Alitis&#39;s left leg suddenly goes limp.

Jimek rakes the jagged edge of a buckler at Alitis.
Alitis&#39;s left arm suddenly goes limp.

Throwing back his head, Alitis screams agonizingly.

Alitis flings his arms up to the heavens, and a booming laugh echoes from his 
mighty frame.

You step in quickly with a slash across Alitis&#39;s torso. ( SITARA LATERAL -&amp;gt; Alitis )
Alitis winces slightly as his skin reddens.
You quickly flow into the Ein-Fasit stance.

Alitis screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.

Alitis screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.

You say to Alitis, in Akrabi, "You are done, filth."

You smirk.
Your pose is now: smirking smugly.

Alitis screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.

You rub some cirisosis on a sinuous obsidian knife.

You step in quickly with a slash across Alitis&#39;s torso. ( SITARA LATERAL -&amp;gt; Alitis )
You quickly flow into the Laesan stance.

Alitis screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.

Lord Alitis Valstivar slowly looks upon the sunrise, for the last time.

Alitis&#39;s body spasms suddenly before he slowly falls to the ground in death.
You have slain Alitis.  &amp;lt;-  Alitis = Owned.
As Alitis draws his final, dying breath, you hear him whisper the word, 
"Vengeance!". Suddenly, a spear of jagged bone materialises from thin air and 
plunges into your chest!

Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "It is done."

A quiet chanting pervades the room as a feeling of peace settles upon you.

Parter says, "That hurt."

You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.

Jimek Qaqyesil says to you, in Akrabi, "I thank you, Brother."

Aralin Midbere smiles coldly.

You say, in Akrabi, "Of course."

(Antioch): You say, "Alitis was fond of &#39;augmenting&#39; himself with demonic 
limbs. As of today, he is unable to do such any longer."'>Lord Alitis Valstivar says, "We all know what's going to happen... a bunch of
people are going to prism in, one of your leaders will say you have to kill me,
then I'll die and be back in Stavenn for supper."
You shall now speak in Common.
A wind far above causes thick cloud to obscure the Triple Eclipse, yet even
through that billowing veil, the triple circle of the unified moons shines
through.
Lord Alitis Valstivar says, "So, how about we skip the middleman and just get
on with the killing, hm?"
Jimek whips his tail around, segments clicking loudly, and slaps Alitis in the
face with it.
You say, "I do not make an habit of repeating the same mistake twice. And as
for you, you will speak when I order you to do so."
A masked man's eyes sparkle with amusement.
The chamber of salvation. (Nowhere.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Located
far below the sweltering heat of the desert, this chamber has a damp and dreary
air to it. The stone walls are perfectly circular, though the faultless
sandstone is marred by ritualistic symbols scrawled haphazardly across it in
what appears to be blood. Two lone torches adorn the walls opposite one
another, held in place by blackened steel. They cast most of the chamber in a
dim, eerie light, while the rest is left in shadow. Unsettling reddish-brown
stains can be seen on the stone floor, and long forgotten bones have been
heaped to one side, adding a disturbing feel to the gloomy room. This has been
marked as holy ground. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces
here, padding softly back and forth. Jimek Qaqyesil is here, giving off a truly
ghastly stench. He holds a buckler in each hand. Aralin Midbere is here. She
wields a tower shield in her left hand and a jagged black sitara in her right.
Lord Alitis Valstivar is here, sprawled on the ground.
You see a single exit leading north.
Nuvantes releases the clasp on his mask, revealing himself.
Alitis grins mischievously.
Lord Alitis Valstivar asks, "You really think you can order a noble of the
Imperium around?"
You quietly step up behind Alitis, bringing the pommel of your sitara to bear
and cracking it across the base of his skull in one deft movement.
Alitis suddenly regains consciousness.
With lightning speed Jimek strikes Alitis's head with a devastating shield
attack.
You say, "As I said: Do not talk unless ordered."
Jimek gives Alitis the once over.
Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil says to Alitis, "You are no more a noble than a rat."
You gag a bit as Jimek's stink wafts over you.
Lord Alitis Valstivar says, "Well... that was somewhat painful... can't say I
haven't experienced worse."
You say to Aralin, "Gag him. I grow tired of his ramblings."
Lord Alitis Valstivar asks Nuvantes, "Oh come now... do you really think I kill
Antiochans just because I'm in the mood for it?"
Lord Alitis Valstivar says, "Well... actually I do sometimes... but that's not
the point."
(Antioch): You say, "If any of you wishes to watch, I believe it would prove to
be an entertaining event."
(Antioch): Kira says, "..."
Aralin Midbere takes a piece of cloth in her hand and ties it roughly about
Alitis' mouth, effectively gagging him.
Alitis glares angrily at Aralin.
Jimek smirks.
Aralin's deadly tail sways slowly behind her.
You say, "Much better. Very well, then. Now that he is silenced, we may begin."
Lord Alitis Valstivar tries to respond, but due to the gag, does nothing more
than utter a series of incomprehensible noises.
Aralin smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "Obedient, as well as charming."
Alitis creases his brow in a frown.
You tell Epiphany, Goddess of Life, "We have, yes."
Lord Alitis Valstivar attempts to lash out, but finds himself held in place,
unable to move.
You say, "Firstly, we will start by restraining his movements. While the webs
serve that purpose to a point, they are not as effective, and quite honestly,
not as amusing as broken limbs."
Alitis rolls his eyes.
You say to Jimek, "So, if you will, Brother?"
You nudge Jimek with your smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.
Jimek ceases to wield a buckler in his left hand.
Jimek takes up a buckler in his left hand.
Jimek ceases to wield a buckler in his right hand.
Jimek takes up a buckler in his right hand.
Lord Alitis Valstivar mutters, "Anti....ns... no imaginat..n when it ...es ..
.orture..."
Jimek lunges and strikes Alitis's arm, which instantly goes limp.
Jimek lunges and strikes Alitis's arm, which instantly goes limp.
Jimek thrusts his blade into Alitis's leg, which gives way beneath him.
Jimek thrusts his blade into Alitis's leg, which gives way beneath him.
Aralin nods her head.
You say, "Excellent. Now that he is restrained, we will begin the
more...'creative' part."
Lord Alitis Valstivar mutters, "Like ... .an ca... .e pain I ha....t alrea..
.elt."
You say to Aralin, "If you have the tools with you?"
Aralin Midbere says, "An application of strychnine first, perhaps?"
You say to Aralin, "Of course."
Aralin carefully wipes all the toxins off of a jagged black sitara.
You say, "The strychnine will, of course, enhance his pain multifold, and
hopefully make the only sounds to leave his mouth in the near future be screams
of agony."
You say to Aralin, "A high dosage, if you will."
Nuvantes smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
Parter arrives from the north.
With a flourish of his arm, Parter bows deeply.
You nod your head at Parter politely.
Aralin Midbere kneels down by Alitis and carves her sitara across his torso,
ensuring the toxin enters his bloodstream.
Alitis winces in pain.
You whisper to Parter, "If you could sit down and watch? This will be a
complicate procedure."
Parter sits down.
You nod your head.
Aralin Midbere presses the blade of her knife under Alitis' chin, just hard
enough to draw a thin trickle of blood. Leaning foward, she whispers coldly,
"You will beg for death before we are done.".
You say, "Very good. Let us see if the toxin has entered his bloodstream,
then."
Lord Alitis Valstivar closes his eyes and starts chanting under his breath,
although the gag fouls his words and he keeps on starting over.
Aralin narrows her eyes at Alitis in an unnerving manner.
A sudden wind whips through the wind as the temperature begins to plummet
rapidly. Plumes of your breath begin to form in the coldness.
You have emoted: Orovan moves closer to Alitis' restrained form, and grasps one
of his arms, reversing the grip on his stone sitara and piercing the demonic
implement deeply, before roughly moving it towards the joint, cutting deeply in
the process.
Lord Alitis Valstivar shudders in pain, but keeps going with his chanting,
desperately trying to maintain concentration throught the pain.
Aralin Midbere says to Alitis, "Be silent."
A low, gutteral whispering echoes throughout the room, slowly increasing to a
maddening chorus of chaotic voices.
You say to Jimek, "Your shields. Batter his head."
Thrusting forward, Jimek brings his shield crashing into Alitis.
Diving forward, Jimek bashes his shield into Alitis.
You say, "Enough."
Jimek gives Alitis the once over.
Jimek nods his head.
Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil says, "I will ensure his silence."
You say to Nuvantes, "Terminate his chatter. Permanently."
Lord Alitis Valstivar chants louder and louder, though the words are coming out
garbled due to the injuries inflicted.
With a dry hiss, Aralin raises her venomous tail in warning at Alitis.
A sudden blackness descends upon the room as the torches flicker low with a
howling wind before slowly regaining their brief gasps of light. Shadows
seemingly disengage from each corner, wavering menacingly.
You quietly step up behind Alitis, bringing the pommel of your sitara to bear
and cracking it across the base of his skull in one deft movement.
Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil leans over to Alitis' restrained body, and removes his
gag. As Alitis starts to chant more, but Nuvantes quickly thrusts his hand into
his mouth, draws out his tongue, and taking his sitara in hand, slices it off.
You say to Alitis, "You dare to try and taint this Holy place? Oh, you will
suffer for it. Far, far more than you imagine."
Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil says to Alitis, "The only sound you will make now, are
screams."
The temperature continues to decrease as a thin layer of frost begins to form
on your surroundings.
Alitis utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
Aralin squints suspiciously at her surroundings.
Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil throws the tongue of Alitis to the ground, where it
sits in a pool of blood.
You have emoted: Orovan eyes his surroundings with some unease, unused to and
surprised by such temperatures in the heart of Antioch.
Jimek taps his tail against the ground.
You tap your tail against the ground.
Lord Alitis Valstivar grins a little, as if knowing something that those
standing around him don't, as blood pools around his lips and drips onto the
ground.
You say, "This is nothing. We will coninue."
You look skeptical and say to Aralin, "The tools. Immediately."
Tendrils of fog emanate from each corner, thickening as they slowly encircle
the form of Alitis. A sudden wailing emits across the room, nearly deafening
you.
Alitis cackles hellishly.
Jimek peers about himself unscrupulously.
With a dry hiss, you raise your tail in warning at Alitis, the barb at its tip
glistening dangerously.
Aralin Midbere produces a few needles from her satchel and offers them to
Orovan.
Suddenly the room is plunged into darkness as you feel shadowy forms brushing
against you.
Aralin snarls viciously.
Nuvantes almost casually steps up behind Alitis and smashes the pommel of his
sitara across the back of his head.
Alitis suddenly regains consciousness.
With a dry hiss, Jimek raises his venomous tail in warning.
You yell, "You scare no-one, filth!"
Lord Alitis Valstivar tries to talk, but with his tongue cut out, it only comes
out a garbled mess closely resembling the phrase "too late".
You say to Alitis, "No, no..."
You have emoted: Orovan smirks broadly.
You nudge Aralin with your smooth, segmented tail, urging her to proceed.
Soft whisperings echo near your ear in a gutteral, dark language reminiscent of
a deep chuckling as the fog begins to swirl in every widening circles across
the room.
Lord Alitis Valstivar turns his gaze upon the Triple Eclipse above, a satisfied
grin on his face.
You say, "Continue your work. This will not hinder us. He is not a threat."
Aralin Midbere kneels by Alitis' head, and takes a thin knife in her hand,
dangling it almost tauntingly infront of his eyes. With a smirk, she places a
hand on his face and forces his right eye open. "Now...you will scream.".
Alitis smirks.
You have emoted: Orovan chitters angrily, motioning for those around him to
speed up their tasks, as he states: I will return shortly. He will not leave
until he has been given what I brought him here for.
+ I move in and out here +
Aralin shoves the blade into Alitis' eye socket and slowly severs his eye
from his head, watching as the blood pools forth.
An inhuman scream of agony pierces the air, echoing throughout the City as it
slowly fades away.
You have emoted: Orovan returns to the room with a displeased grimace, a
covered vial tightly gripped in his hand.
Aralin Midbere takes up the severed eye in her hand and licks the blood off of
it, a grim but satisfied expression on her face.
Lord Alitis Valstivar cries out in pain, but retains his composure somewhat. He
lets his head drop over to the side and lets the blood trickle across the
ground towards his arm.
(Antioch): Silken says, "What now?"
(Antioch): Kira says, "For the love of the Divine."
(Antioch): Kalima says, "What was that scream?"
(Antioch): Draven says, "What scream?"
(Antioch): Kalima says, "You didnt hear it?"
(Antioch): Draven says, "Must be centered in Antioch, I'm in Nirvana."
(Antioch): Kalima says, "An inhuman scream of agony pierces the air, echoing
throughout the City as it slowly fades away."
(Antioch): Draven says, "Pilg home."
(Antioch): Kalima says, "Is what I heard.."
(Antioch): Silken says, "Ah, nevermind."
(Antioch): Silken says, "It may appear inhuman, but it is very very human."
(Antioch): Kalima says, "Aye?"
(Pkmn): Jimek says, "I think it's some demon."
(Pkmn): Jimek says, "That Alitis has."
(Antioch): Jace says, "They must have began the torture."
(Antioch): Kalima says, ".."
(Antioch): Kalima says, "Which?"
(Antioch): You say, "Alitis is currently in our grasp, though he is trying his
best not to be."
Aralin Midbere nudges Parter foward with her tail, casting her gaze towards the
boy. "You will remove the second one." With a faint smirk, she hands Parter the
knife.
(Antioch): Kalima says, "Ah, I see. so nothing for me to worry about then,
yes?"
(Antioch): You say, "Indeed."
A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room. &amp;lt;- PRISM.
Draven suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.
You shall now speak in Akrabi.
(Antioch): Aralin says, "He merely objected to me removing his eye, that is
all. Nothing to worry yourselves over."
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says, "Interesting. I never knew
this demoner could hit a soprano."
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says, "Good work."
(Antioch): Jace says, "Oh ok."
You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.
Alitis glares angrily at Draven.
Aralin nudges Parter with her smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.
You say to Draven, in Akrabi, "I would have appreciated a warning, though you
are not unwelcome."
Shadows converge over Alitis, swirling slowly as a dark glow begins to emit
from its surroundings.
Jimek taps his tail against the ground.
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to you, "My apologies.
What's going on with him?"
Jimek Qaqyesil says to Alitis, "You begin to anger me, scum."
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide gestures towards the shadows.
You say to Draven, in Akrabi, "He was able to cast some sort of spell before
his tongue was permanently removed. These will not linger after we terminate
him, though."
Lord Alitis Valstivar focuses intently on the blood coming out of his removed
eye, and as it nears his hand, he discreetly dips one of his talons in the
blood and begins drawing something into the ground.
Aralin whips her tail around, segments clicking loudly, and slaps Alitis in the
face with it.
Alitis smirks.
Aralin Midbere rolls the severed eye in her palm, smiling wryly.
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to you, in Akrabi, "Oh,
they need not last at all. Allow me to demonstrate how easily the pure light of
our ways can banish such mere darkness."
Sankug Nuvantes Qaqyesil take his sitara, and whips it through Alitis' hand,
ceasing his drawing.
Throwing back his head, Alitis screams agonizingly.
You hear the low snarling of an unknown creature emit from the fog as the dark
glowing intensifies.
Draven blinks.
You tap your tail against the ground.
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to you, in Akrabi, "Oh, not
some normal darkness?"
You nod your acknowledgement of Draven.
Parter severs alitis' second eye.
(Pkmn): You say, "Cute."
(Pkmn): Nuvantes says, "Hahaha."
Aralin gives Parter an acknowledging nod.
(SB): You say, "At least he tried."
Jimek Qaqyesil kneels by Alitis' side, and whispers in his ear.
Jimek whispers something to Alitis.
You say, "Very well, then. It is time."
You say to Alitis, "I have a gift of sorts, for you."
Alitis raises an eyebrow at you.
Blood pools across the room near Alitis in thick, crimson masses as it begins
to slowly move across the room.
Aralin narrows her eyes to thin slits.
You tap your tail against the ground.
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide glances curiously towards
Orovan.
You shall now speak in Akrabi.
You exclaim, in Akrabi, "Restrain him! I am not done!"
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to you, in Akrabi, "Should
I bless this room?"
You shall now speak in Common.
Lord Alitis Valstivar closes his eyes in intense concentration, letting more
blood seep out of his eyes.
You say to Alitis, "You will see for yourself, filth."
Droplets of blood move seemingly of their own accord as a pentagram slowly
begins to form of its own. Each ragged line crossing another.
You say to Alitis, "You are fond of experiments, but I have my own."
Draven stands with arms outstretched, his mouth moving rapidly in fervent
prayer to the Lord of the Seven Suns.
Jimek snorts arrogantly.
Pure strands of light weave themselves together before Draven, and within
seconds he holds a spiritual mace within his grasp.
Draven begins to wield a spiritual mace in his left hand.
Draven takes up a tower shield in his right hand.
Jimek Qaqyesil says, "Show yourself, scum."
Lord Alitis Valstivar turns his head towards Orovan, and opens his empty eye
sockets again.
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide grimaces is mild disgust at
Alitis' visage.
You have emoted: Orovan takes the vial in his hand, and roughly removes the
cover, eyeing Alitis' battered form.
Jimek whispers to you, "There is little doubt in my mind he is attempting to
summon a type of demon to assist him."
You say to Alitis, "This is a toxin compost I have created...and it will assure
that you do not conduct any experiments on yourself ever again."
Alitis raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You see a burst of fire explode from the completed pentagram, flaring upwards
towards the ceiling before slowly burning within the contained area.
Alitis utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
You click and chitter angrily.
Jimek clicks and chitters angrily.
You have emoted: Orovan quickly makes his way towards Alitis, gripping him
tightly and forcing the vial's contents into his open wounds.
You say to Alitis, "It is a compost, filth. Xeroderma and Veratrum, designed to
use the victim's own demonic energies against him, and purge him of them.
Permanently."
You smirk.
Your pose is now: smirking smugly.
Aralin's deadly tail sways slowly behind her.
You say, "You should feel the effects soon enough."
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide closes his eyes and raises his
arms towards the ceiling, whispering prayers to the Lord of the Suns.
Suddenly the fire is snuffed out completely as an equally blinding white light
explodes across the room as the temperature raises drastically.
Aralin Midbere says to Alitis, "You will be purged in the name of the Pure."
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide lowers his eyes towards the form
of Alitis, a satisfied smile upon his face.
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says to Alitis, in Akrabi, "Your
powers....are as bugs beneath the feet of the Gods."
You say to Alitis, "So, you see...your efforts here are laughable. You will be
Pure of body, forcefully."
Lord Alitis Valstivar opens his empty sockets wide, suddenly fear is evident
upon his features, as if whatever he was trying has backfired.
Torches flare to life as the thick fog is burned away, exposing the room.
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide closes his eyes and lowers his
hands to the floor, laying further blessings of holy power within the room.
Draven enacts the Rite of Banishment, calling upon the Lord of the Seven Suns
to make this holy ground anathema to the demonic ones.
You say, in Akrabi, "Prepare him! I will induce toxin shock to speed up the
process."
You nudge Nuvantes with your smooth, segmented tail, urging him to proceed.
Flare Angel, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide says, in Akrabi, "I must
depart..but this prayer shall hold fast. I hope."
Aralin gives Draven an acknowledging nod.
Jimek rakes the jagged edge of a buckler at Alitis.
Alitis's right leg suddenly goes limp.
Jimek chops at Alitis with the edge of a buckler.
Alitis's right arm suddenly goes limp.
Lord Alitis Valstivar vainly struggles to free himself, trying to get away and
preserve what he worked so hard to achieve.
Jimek slices at Alitis with the sharpened edge of a buckler.
Alitis's left leg suddenly goes limp.
Jimek rakes the jagged edge of a buckler at Alitis.
Alitis's left arm suddenly goes limp.
Throwing back his head, Alitis screams agonizingly.
Alitis flings his arms up to the heavens, and a booming laugh echoes from his
mighty frame.
You step in quickly with a slash across Alitis's torso. ( SITARA LATERAL -&amp;gt; Alitis )
Alitis winces slightly as his skin reddens.
You quickly flow into the Ein-Fasit stance.
Alitis screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.
Alitis screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.
You say to Alitis, in Akrabi, "You are done, filth."
You smirk.
Your pose is now: smirking smugly.
Alitis screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.
You rub some cirisosis on a sinuous obsidian knife.
You step in quickly with a slash across Alitis's torso. ( SITARA LATERAL -&amp;gt; Alitis )
You quickly flow into the Laesan stance.
Alitis screams in agony, skin steaming in the sunlight.
Lord Alitis Valstivar slowly looks upon the sunrise, for the last time.
Alitis's body spasms suddenly before he slowly falls to the ground in death.
You have slain Alitis. &amp;lt;- Alitis = Owned.
As Alitis draws his final, dying breath, you hear him whisper the word,
"Vengeance!". Suddenly, a spear of jagged bone materialises from thin air and
plunges into your chest!
Jimek Qaqyesil says, in Akrabi, "It is done."
A quiet chanting pervades the room as a feeling of peace settles upon you.
Parter says, "That hurt."
You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.
Jimek Qaqyesil says to you, in Akrabi, "I thank you, Brother."
Aralin Midbere smiles coldly.
You say, in Akrabi, "Of course."
(Antioch): You say, "Alitis was fond of 'augmenting' himself with demonic
limbs. As of today, he is unable to do such any longer."</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+2 points with 6 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
