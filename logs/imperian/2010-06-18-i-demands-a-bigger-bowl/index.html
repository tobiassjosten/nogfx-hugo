Cassie flexes her muscles in an impressive display of strength.

Silken appears, cloaked by a swirling white mist.She is followed by a brooding vulture, a red-tailed hawk, and a small sparrow.

A vehement whirlwind of sand suddenly befalls you, leaving you momentarily blinded. Upon opening your eyes, you find that Silken is no longer with you.
She is followed by a brooding vulture, a red-tailed hawk, and a small sparrow.

The spicy scent of cinnamon and myrrh sweetened with honey lingers in the air.

look mi
She is an athletic Lamira. She is standing at about 5 feet 8 inches. Her skin is light blue in color, upon closer inspection you notice that she has webbing between her fingers and gills upon her neck. Her eyes are grey in color and are fliting about the room never settling on something for too long. Her hair is black and falls down to around her shoulders. She is wearing a sapphire stud tongue ring, a golden silk pack, 2 low-slung hematite scabbards, a pair of leather greaves, a feathered black velvet cloak, a soft jade gossamer sari, a leather helm, a suit of scale mail, and a pair of leather vambraces. She wields a strong broadsword in each hand.

Cassie&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Mistress Rudha Viantha, Ascetic of Spirit says, "As long as the bowl is big enough he wont have a memory span long enough to remember seeing the bowl."

Cassie Amakiir says, "He is a fish.. not a person."

A great weight seems to have been lifted from Arvus.

Arvus rubs some salve on his skin.

Mistress Rudha Viantha, Ascetic of Spirit says, "I shall return!"

The room seems to dim as Rudha Viantha leaves to the southwest.

Rafiq Miren, Disciple of the Dance says, "I could get a bowl."

As Zhov comes into view the world seems more on edge.

Rafiq Miren, Disciple of the Dance says, "If I wanted one."

Miren peers about herself unscrupulously.

You tell Cassie Amakiir, "I cannot help but admit I&#39;m laughing so hard right now."

Cassie ponders Arvus&#39;s profile, wondering if it would make a suitable subject for a portrait.

Arvus flashes Cassie a joyous smile.

The aroma of fresh bread baking drifts on the breeze.

Cassie reaches over with a grin on her face and playfully ruffles Arvus&#39;s hair.

 (Market): Arvus says, "3 more for the queue."
