Plus stun and knockout. So yeah, poor wardancers.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf6ba8df8dfcaaf54773e1311f830f6b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mbayliss1990@xxx on 06Â Apr 2010</p>They can do all the entangle methods in the game. True. However, you do not need deafness against a Wardancer so you can instead keep up blindness(If you&rsquo;re really that worried about being transfixed). As far as bind is concerned, it takes 1 rope and takes up balance if you can&rsquo;t bind them. Additionally, web tattoo takes EQ equivalent to your opponents writhe speed and in the case of bards/wardancers themselves, more than the opposing writhe EQ due to flexibility. The point stands that without paralysis triggering the condition for bind you&rsquo;ll have only Transfixation as a -reliable- writhe method to hold someone down because you cannot do -anything- but impale/disembowel once you&rsquo;ve impaled them. They can still reliably sip/drink despite being impaled so&mldr; while it&rsquo;s a method to hold them down it is in no way reliable compared to say.. paralysis/bind. So&mldr; unless knockout, which has a shorter knockout period than the balance recovery -and- does not deliver a toxin -and- which is parryable, were to be increased to allow a reliable bind, or if -stun- actually did something beyond just stunning them (I think it should be parryable as well, as it is a free toxin with no repercussions to the WD) Then I would agree with you. I do agree though, poor wardancers because they already get so many cool toys.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed6448a92c7b99fef57c4ecd650ab11d?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by david.anez@xxx on 06Â Apr 2010</p>Knockout being parryable is moot, since WD can combo blade feint. Same with stun, but yes, it should be parryable as well. Maybe what I really dislike about bind being able to trigger from paralysis is the now usual combo of blade flick with ciguatoxin + shield stun, which is a ping war of getting unstunned + curing the ciguatoxin vs the wd binding.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf6ba8df8dfcaaf54773e1311f830f6b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mbayliss1990@xxx on 06Â Apr 2010</p>Good point. When the next round comes in I&rsquo;ll ask that stun be parryable in some manner. Maybe torso? Since the WD needs to hit your stomach or chest or some such to hurt you that way. WD needs -some- slight nerfs here and there, but nothing major and no major upgrades.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22fbe443696bd78608f9d659857aa19?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by leviebiv4@xxx (author) on 07Â Apr 2010</p>Blade flick plus shield stun? That&rsquo;s a horrible way to get a bind. Blade spin would be easier since you regain balance on the last slash and just spam bind enemy until it happens would chase balance. You can do the same with transfix and oxalis. Either way I don&rsquo;t care, I just use bind because I didn&rsquo;t have to do much more coding to put it in my system, I&rsquo;d just start tracking blindness if I didn&rsquo;t have bind and it&rsquo;d do the same exact job.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed6448a92c7b99fef57c4ecd650ab11d?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by david.anez@xxx on 07Â Apr 2010</p>Except that blade spin could hit rebounding, you could get hindered before the second tick, the enemy can leave the room&mldr; Pray tell why blade flick + shield stun is such a terrible way to get a bind again?</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
