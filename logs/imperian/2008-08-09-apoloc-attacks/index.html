You feel yourself grow slightly hungrier as the demonic worm feeds.
The chimera's dragon head exhales a cloud of gas at you, and you feel sleepy.
You feel incredibly tired, and fall asleep immediately.
The demonic storm belches fire at you, burning you badly.
You are jerked awake by the pain.
&lt;274/274h 225/225m 1241e 1025w &lt;eb> &lt;s> &lt;p>>
The walls close in to suffocate you - you must escape! (claustrophobia)

The gremlin races between your legs, throwing you off-balance.
Flames erupt all over your body and begin to consume your flesh.
You have been slain by Apoloc. (all)
You squirm in agony as you fall to bashing level 59 and sigh in frustration at
your new rank of Illustrious.
A linseed falls out of your inventory.
