A shrouded clearing. (lost) (a Veiled Chaparral.)
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. The plant 
life here has drawn back, but whether in fear or revulsion is hard to tell. 
Centered within the clearing is some strange statue, its neck merely providing 
an opening as there is no head. A clear delineation separates the line of 
nature and the central barren area, the very trees seeming to cringe from the 
spot as their boughs tend to lean away. Traces of scars across the ground 
provide evidence of a large scale explosion although the furrows have long 
since been overcome by the wilds. A decaying statue of obsidian rests here, its
head no longer resting in place. Codecent Rostov Iscariot is riding on a black 
ouroboros. He is holding a blackened iron tower shield in his left hand.

around its base, through which a serpent of granite and steel is seen 
constricted about the stone blocks. There are 2 corpses of a bloody mutation

It is raining heavily, pregnant drops of water pouring down onto you. Small

openings to prevent vision into the nearby passageways. Some master hand seems 
to have placed the trees, their perfect rows providing egress in each cardinal 
direction while small shrubs dot the corners of each avenue. Despite the 
greenery a palpable sense of sorrow seems to weigh on the plant life, their 
boughs and leaves drooping considerably. A dark mist floats along the ground.

It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. A decaying

Farrell is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. She wields a concave steel

A shrouded clearing. (lost) (a Veiled Chaparral.)
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. The plant
life here has drawn back, but whether in fear or revulsion is hard to tell.
Centered within the clearing is some strange statue, its neck merely providing
an opening as there is no head. A clear delineation separates the line of
nature and the central barren area, the very trees seeming to cringe from the
spot as their boughs tend to lean away. Traces of scars across the ground
provide evidence of a large scale explosion although the furrows have long
since been overcome by the wilds. A decaying statue of obsidian rests here, its
head no longer resting in place. Codecent Rostov Iscariot is riding on a black
ouroboros. He is holding a blackened iron tower shield in his left hand.
You see a single exit leading south.

Beside a foul, decaying corpse.
It is raining heavily, pregnant drops of water pouring down onto you. A stone
tower has been erected here in honour of the Griever, remaining true to the
influences of ruin in its ever-crumbling state. A grey mist hangs in the air
around its base, through which a serpent of granite and steel is seen
constricted about the stone blocks. There are 2 corpses of a bloody mutation
here. Mubina Farrell is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. She wields a
concave steel tower shield in her left hand and a Basilican mace in her right.

Chaparral veiled by dense fog. (a Veiled Chaparral.)
It is raining heavily, pregnant drops of water pouring down onto you. Small
trees line small avenues darkened by a grey seepage that flows about the ground
with seeming sentience. The fog dances along the tree line, congested along the
openings to prevent vision into the nearby passageways. Some master hand seems
to have placed the trees, their perfect rows providing egress in each cardinal
direction while small shrubs dot the corners of each avenue. Despite the
greenery a palpable sense of sorrow seems to weigh on the plant life, their
boughs and leaves drooping considerably. A dark mist floats along the ground.
