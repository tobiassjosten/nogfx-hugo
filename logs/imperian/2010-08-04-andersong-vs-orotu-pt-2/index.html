They reach toward the sky like spears, never wider than a sapling but often taller than any of the Five Towers. Nothing grows between them save for ivy, but even that parasitic vine avoids these trees as if they were plague-ridden. A winding trail, possibly broken by deer or some other swift prey species, leads through the trees and around the mountain. A black, murky mist has settled here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Song Kei'daan is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. She wields a gold and silver broadsword in her left hand and a gold shield trimmed with silver in her right.

Deep in the Northreach Mountains. (Demon's Pass.) (13322)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The trees that grow here are disturbingly tall and spindly. They reach toward the sky like spears, never wider than a sapling but often taller than any of the Five Towers. Nothing grows between them save for ivy, but even that parasitic vine avoids these trees as if they were plague-ridden. A winding trail, possibly broken by deer or some other swift prey species, leads through the trees and around the mountain. A black, murky mist has settled here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Song Kei'daan is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. She wields a gold and silver broadsword in her left hand and a gold shield trimmed with silver in her right.
