Near a sapphire hued stream. (Cuhpfehr hills.)
Rivulets of heated water create a large stream partially blocked by a large 
outcropping of rocks. Slowed considerably from its original rushing motion, the
stream weaves across this large cavern to disappear beneath a southern wall. 
Its seemingly calm appearance gives the illusion of refreshing waters, though 
the odour of sulphur gives evidence to its origins. Each wall sparkles with a 
thin layer of natural crystals as each glows from an unknown source. Varying 
hues of colour reflect across the cavern to reflect light deep into the stream.
A series of large crystals protrude from a wall at an unusual angle as they 
provide a natural archway leading into three separate caverns. A dervish, 
whirling about faster than the eye can see, is here. Runia, Defiler's 
Asphyxiation is here. She wields an ivory sitara in her left hand. Enteri is 
here. Councilor Dymphna Nessaja is here.

Near a sapphire hued stream. (Cuhpfehr hills.)
Rivulets of heated water create a large stream partially blocked by a large
outcropping of rocks. Slowed considerably from its original rushing motion, the
stream weaves across this large cavern to disappear beneath a southern wall.
Its seemingly calm appearance gives the illusion of refreshing waters, though
the odour of sulphur gives evidence to its origins. Each wall sparkles with a
thin layer of natural crystals as each glows from an unknown source. Varying
hues of colour reflect across the cavern to reflect light deep into the stream.
A series of large crystals protrude from a wall at an unusual angle as they
provide a natural archway leading into three separate caverns. A dervish,
whirling about faster than the eye can see, is here. Runia, Defiler's
Asphyxiation is here. She wields an ivory sitara in her left hand. Enteri is
here. Councilor Dymphna Nessaja is here.
You see exits leading northeast, east, southeast, and south.
