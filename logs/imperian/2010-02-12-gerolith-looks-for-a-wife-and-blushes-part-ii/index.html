This has been marked as holy ground. Lined with spartan stools, a wide bar runs
the length of the rear wall. A weary old wolf lies in the corner upon a ratty 
rug, half-asleep. Sitting at the end of the bar is an impressive wolf&#39;s head 
which has been mounted on an ironwood base. Magaelan is here, holding aloft a 
rather large mug. A backless swivel stool sits here. The extraordinary wingspan
of an enormous black crow casts a grey shadow upon everything around it, 
rendering the surroundings in a foreboding black and white. A large, gold 
flecked hawk hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the 
light. A fur trimmed tapestry of hide, the Wendigo of Ithaqua depicted 
ominously in its center, hangs from the wall here. Balanced easily on its 
oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with 
its huge, blue eyes. There are 3 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. A dead rat has 
been left here. There are 3 wooden mug of Warden&#39;s Milks here. You see a sign 
here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see a single exit leading out (open door).

Singing drunkenly to himself, Gerolith enters from the out.

<307/307h 370/370m 1402e 1658w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
A huge man, Gerolith, who refers to himself as "the God of Might", is a Norrjin
with heavily tanned skin. He is almost completely devoid of hair, save for a 
large handlebar mustache, and his bald head reflects gently back some of the 
light which strikes it. His chest is like that of an ale barrel and his limbs 
are wide with muscle to match, creating an image of strength. He smiles almost 
perpetually and his large brown eyes are warm and inviting, edged with the 
mirth that seems to be forever part of his mood. About his wide chest he wears 
a strong metal breastplate, though no other armor to match. Instead he wears a 
pair of heavy leggings and a pair of oversized boots stuffed with fur for 
warmth. Gerolith would be an imposing figure, if not for his obviously jovial 
appearance and the mug in his left hand, which seems somehow to always be full,
aiding in his perceived perpetual good mood.
Gerolith, God of Might appears to be extraordinarily strong.

worthy of a God of Might. A fine fur cloak of beasts felled by your own mighty 
hands. Not some weed plucked along the roadside."

Gerolith, God of Might says, "And now, Gerolith, God of Might, will drink and 
allow the citizens of Ithaqua to entertain him with tales of bravery. Though 
they can never be as good as his own mighty deeds, it will amuse him to hear of
them nonetheless."

Sommnus says, "I managed to slip their grasp but left an exaggerated trail back
into the Pines. I hid in the branches and lay wait for the monsters."

Sommnus says, "It wasn&#39;t long before they came right into my trap and they were

Sommnus chuckles long and heartily.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Juanope raises an eyebrow at Sommnus.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus drains the last drops of a mixed cocktail from a wooden mug of Warden&#39;s
Milk.
Sommnus coughs violently, choking down a swig from his mug.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus coughs softly.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus&#39;s mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>>
You say, "I&#39;m guessiing it&#39;s onee of those &#39;guy things&#39;"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus grins mischievously at Gerolith, God of Might.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>>
You say, "And, as ssuch....I probAbbly don&#39;t wan *hic* T to knnow."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You shudder violently as a chill ripples down your spine.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You drain the last drops of a mixed cocktail from a wooden mug of Warden&#39;s 
Milk.
With a great amount of effort, you manage to drink some of the thick liquid, 
coughing as the drink slowly makes its way down, the wood chips and leaves 
within it rough against your throat.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Juanope nods her head in agreement.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Gerolith only speaks of small and angry women 
that occasionally accompany the strange, though good-looking children. They 
shout a lot and cause problems for fine drinking establishments all over 
Aetherius. So Gerolith must chase them away."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus gives Gerolith, God of Might a slow nod.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You have emoted: Iolana opens her mouth to say something, thinks better of it, 
and closes it again, settling herself a little more comfortably and having 
another drink of milk.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus smiles with a wink and says, "If anything, besides a wonderous beauty 
with dark eyes, would give a God of Might pause, I&#39;d think it might be a 
Godling of Might."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "One time, Gerolith found a basket with his name 
written upon it. Inside was a baby! Gerolith does not eat babies, and does not 
understand such a strange gift."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might scratches his head in confusion.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Juanope nods her head at Sommnus, showing her acceptance.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You raise an eyebrow at Gerolith, God of Might.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>>
You say, "What became of the, Eeer, gIft?"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "I forget, I gave it to some wench who cooed and 
prodded at it."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might shrugs helplessly.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus smiles and says, "Never eam babies, not enough meat on them."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Perhaps she eats babies. I do not accept such 
gifts."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus chuckles long and heartily.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Surakai smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You mutter, "Men..."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Juanope Sunjackal says to Sommnus, "But they are a little fattier for their 
size than most things."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You mutter, "An.. .ppare *hic* ...., Gods..."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Surakai Lothain says to you, "Excuse me?!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You blink.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You say to Surakai, "Why? What did you do?"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You tilt your head curiously.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Surakai narrows his eyes at you in an unnerving manner.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You hum innocently to yourself.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "But alas, Gerolith must be searching for his 
Beauty now."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You stand up.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You say, "I suppose *hic*  we can let you go, since it is such a noble search 
annd all."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Surakai Lothain says to Gerolith, God of Might, "I wish you the best of luck."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
 Sommnus stands up from the worn ironwood bar.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus stretches languidly.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope Sunjackal half-jumps, half-slides off, Gerolith&#39;s knee being too high.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Unless the women would like to throw me some sort
of celebration because I shall find my love and be married soon, and shall have
no eyes for any woman except for her, the most beautiful of all. In which case 
I shall be glad to stay a little longer and see what they might devise. I had 
thought some sort of dancing, perhaps?"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might looks hopeful.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>
You brandish a sleek javelin menacingly.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You give a mischievous grin.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus says, "Well, I wish you luck in your search and I&#39;ll keep my eyes open.
Should she somehow wind up in my Pines, I&#39;ll see that no wolves come sniffing 
after a beautiful meal."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus inclines his head toward Gerolith, God of Might respectfully.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "And for that you have the gratitude of a God. 
Which goes a very long way, I might add."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might stands to his feet, raising a fist high into the air.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You ponder the situation.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "On to the search!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You say to Gerolith, God of Might, "Good lucK!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus smiles and says, "T&#39;was a pleasurable meat and drink, sir. And words 
exchanged with relish."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>
You kiss Gerolith, God of Might gently on the lips.

 <307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You wink.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You tell Juanope Sunjackal, "And there is my bold story for this month."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope gives you a shifty little smile.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>
You gulp down a mixed cocktail, wetting your palate.
With a great amount of effort, you manage to drink some of the thick liquid, 
coughing as the drink slowly makes its way down, the wood chips and leaves 
within it rough against your throat.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope tells you, "Indeed."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Your eyes sparkle with amusement at Juanope.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope tells you, "I&#39;m going to keep that one."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope nods sagely at you.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Fare thee well, Ithaquans! And if I should find 
her a dream and nothing more, perhaps I shall return here for a wife."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might waggles his eyebrows comically.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You give a trillingly melodic laugh.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might winks at you.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope Sunjackal says to Gerolith, God of Might, "Good luck!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus grins mischievously at Gerolith, God of Might.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might waves goodbye.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope Sunjackal smiles impishly and says, "Or not."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Stumbling slightly, Gerolith leaves to the out.'>The Mounted Cephyreid. (Ithaquan Council.)
This has been marked as holy ground. Lined with spartan stools, a wide bar runs
the length of the rear wall. A weary old wolf lies in the corner upon a ratty
rug, half-asleep. Sitting at the end of the bar is an impressive wolf's head
which has been mounted on an ironwood base. Magaelan is here, holding aloft a
rather large mug. A backless swivel stool sits here. The extraordinary wingspan
of an enormous black crow casts a grey shadow upon everything around it,
rendering the surroundings in a foreboding black and white. A large, gold
flecked hawk hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the
light. A fur trimmed tapestry of hide, the Wendigo of Ithaqua depicted
ominously in its center, hangs from the wall here. Balanced easily on its
oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with
its huge, blue eyes. There are 3 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. A dead rat has
been left here. There are 3 wooden mug of Warden's Milks here. You see a sign
here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see a single exit leading out (open door).
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1326e 1582w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Singing drunkenly to himself, Gerolith enters from the out.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1402e 1658w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
A huge man, Gerolith, who refers to himself as "the God of Might", is a Norrjin
with heavily tanned skin. He is almost completely devoid of hair, save for a
large handlebar mustache, and his bald head reflects gently back some of the
light which strikes it. His chest is like that of an ale barrel and his limbs
are wide with muscle to match, creating an image of strength. He smiles almost
perpetually and his large brown eyes are warm and inviting, edged with the
mirth that seems to be forever part of his mood. About his wide chest he wears
a strong metal breastplate, though no other armor to match. Instead he wears a
pair of heavy leggings and a pair of oversized boots stuffed with fur for
warmth. Gerolith would be an imposing figure, if not for his obviously jovial
appearance and the mug in his left hand, which seems somehow to always be full,
aiding in his perceived perpetual good mood.
Gerolith, God of Might appears to be extraordinarily strong.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1326e 1582w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1329e 1585w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might sidles up to the bar, taking a seat.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1332e 1588w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say to Gerolith, God of Might, "Now, aren't you wandering far from home?
Not often we're graced with your presence out here in the wild."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1326e 1582w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Gerolith, God of Might misses the Ithaquan
drinks."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1337e 1593w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might nods sagely.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1337e 1593w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You give a trillingly melodic laugh.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1338e 1594w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say, "Fair enough."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1339e 1594w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Gerolith also..."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1339e 1595w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might coughs softly.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1341e 1597w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "...needs... help."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1342e 1598w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You tilt your head curiously.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1343e 1599w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say, "...you need...what? I thought I heard Gerolith, God of Might, say he
needs....-help-."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1349e 1605w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "But hey, time for that soon enough! Call
Ithaqua! Gerolith, God of Might, will pay for drinks!"

Your eyes sparkle with amusement.

&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1354e 1610w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "Off with you, woman. Gather them!"

(Ithaqua): You say, "It seems we have a special guest this month, Ithaqua.
Gerolith, God of Might, is offering drinks at the Tavern!"

You roll your eyes.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1357e 1613w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
(Ithaqua): Draven says, "That can't be safe."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1358e 1614w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say, "Don't you 'off with you!' me!"

You say, "I'm calling them."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1359e 1615w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini arrives from the out.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1359e 1615w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "Oh this I have to see."

Raini smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

You incline your head toward Raini respectfully.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1361e 1617w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "Hello!"
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1362e 1618w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
(Ithaqua): You say, "That's more or less what I thought. But hey, free milk is
free milk."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1363e 1619w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say to Raini, "I think I'm losing my hearing in my old age."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1365e 1620w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

Sommnus coughs violently, choking down a swig from his mug.

Gerolith, God of Might says, "If Gerolith was not busy trying to find his wife,
Gerolith would knock your teeth out, sir."

Raini Sunjackal says, "Do you know what she at least smells like or have some
trinket of hers?"

Raini leans comfortably against a Swiftviper javelin.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini lightly taps Nils, a weary old wolf.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "Nils may be old, but maybe we could inspire him to get
up and sniff her out."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You give a trillingly melodic laugh.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say to Raini, "We have a better chance of getting a Lyccaean to sniff her
ouht than Nils."

You drain the last drops of a mixed cocktail from a wooden mug of Warden's
Milk.
With a great amount of effort, you manage to drink some of the thick liquid,
coughing as the drink slowly makes its way down, the wood chips and leaves
within it rough against your throat.

Gerolith, God of Might says, "Gerolith has only hope... but Kinsarmar thinks
Gerolith should sing her sweet songs and give her chocolates to win her heart.
Gerolith is no fancy-pants bard, He is a God."

Sommnus rubs a thick stubble on his chin in thought.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini produces an undecipherable series of clicks.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say to Gerolith, God of Might, "Psh. Bards. Tight-wearing ninNies, the lot

Raini Sunjackal says, "You want my opinion?"

&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
Raini swings the haft of a Swiftviper javelin in a long, sweeping curve at your
head.
The weapon slams into the side of your head and stars explode in your vision
before everything fades to black.
&lt;262/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd> &lt;-45>>
You are unconscious and thus incapable of action.

You suddenly regain your consciousness.
&lt;262/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;pbd>>
You take a drink from a wolf-shaped vial of sinn.
The elixir heals your body.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;pbd>>
Raini nods sagely.

Raini cackles hellishly.

&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus smiles with a wink and says, "A God of Might need not woo with pansies,
sir. I'd say the first step is in finding her. Knowing one's, excuse the term,
prey...is the first step of a huhnt."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "This... works? No songs? No dancing in fancy
tights? Not that Gerolith lacks anything to be desired in a pair of tights.
Gerolith does not believe such things are worthy of His attention."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might coughs softly.

Raini Sunjackal says, "So then what is your big plan to get the woman with dark
eyes and fair skin to notice you hmm?"

Sommnus eyes his mug.

Gerolith, God of Might says, "Gerolith had hoped to discover some method... He

Raini ponders the situation.

Raini Sunjackal says to Gerolith, God of Might, "Why not just get her drunk or

Gerolith, God of Might says, "Well, you know..."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might winks at Sommnus.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You raise an eyebrow at Gerolith, God of Might.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Surakai smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say to Gerolith, God of Might, "Asoing for help and blushing on the shame
day..."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You gulp down a mixed cocktail, wetting your palate.
With a great amount of effort, you manage to drink some of the thick liquid,
coughing as the drink slowly makes its way down, the wood chips and leaves
within it rough against your throat.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "Two firsts for Gerolith."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You nod sagely.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "Unless you count the blush you get when consuming a warm
ale."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal looks skeptical and says, "Maybe then.."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You chuckle long and heartily.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus mumbles, "Pshh...bards...flowers and chocolates? Worthless...".
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Gerolith did not blush! Blushing is for girls...
and elves that titter and dance in tights. Gerolith was merely... distracted."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
"Mhmm," Surakai murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might mutters to himself, "And not without reason.".

You say, "Whatever you saf, O Mighty Onm..."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Surakai takes a large gulp of a mixed cocktail.
Surakai coughs violently, choking down a swig from his mug.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus says, "If a gift you feel you must give, give something practical and
worthy of a God of Might. A fine fur cloak of beasts felled by your own mighty
hands. Not some weed plucked along the roadside."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "So. If Ithaqua sees a beautiful woman who
looks like she needs to find a God in her life... Ithaqua knows what to do. And
Gerolith will keep looking and forget the silly bards and their advice!"
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini nods her head.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini pats Gerolith, God of Might in a friendly manner.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "We will do."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus nods his head at Raini, showing his acceptance.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Also. Gerolith will punch in the teeth any he
hears have been spreading savage rumors about women outsmarting him. And
especially rumors about him blushing, which he did not do."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Your eyes sparkle with amusement at Gerolith, God of Might.

Gerolith, God of Might brandishes his fists defiantly.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say, "In the teetc, hm?"
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "Mhmmmm."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "We'll call it the ale."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Surakai grins mischievously at Gerolith, God of Might.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You have emoted: Iolana considers just how attached to her teeth she really
is...
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "And now, Gerolith, God of Might, will drink and
allow the citizens of Ithaqua to entertain him with tales of bravery. Though
they can never be as good as his own mighty deeds, it will amuse him to hear of
them nonetheless."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Surakai smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Raini's eyes twinkle enchantingly.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might takes a mug and holds it aloft, before quaffing a large
gulp from it, managing to spill the majority.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "Well.."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You give a mischievous grin.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You lean comfortably against a sleek javelin.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Raini Sunjackal says, "I do believe that is my cue to leave."

Sommnus says, "Well, I have slept long and have few tales in recent memory, but
I was beset upon by mountain trolls near the snowfields recently. I had
dispatched a few troublesome monitors when the devious beasts snuck up from
behind."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You tilt your head and listen intently.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus says, "I managed to slip their grasp but left an exaggerated trail back
into the Pines. I hid in the branches and lay wait for the monsters."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus says, "It wasn't long before they came right into my trap and they were
quickly disposed of as well."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus smiles and says, "The Pines are my shadows...and no place for mountain
trolls."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus takes a large gulp of a mixed cocktail.

bump.

Gerolith, God of Might says, "Oho! This is a good tale, Gerolith, God of Might
approves! Of course, the trolls would have been like mere insects to him, but
it is not half bad for one like yourself."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;pbd>>

&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might looks hopeful.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You brandish a sleek javelin menacingly.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You give a mischievous grin.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus says, "Well, I wish you luck in your search and I'll keep my eyes open.
Should she somehow wind up in my Pines, I'll see that no wolves come sniffing
after a beautiful meal."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus inclines his head toward Gerolith, God of Might respectfully.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "And for that you have the gratitude of a God.
Which goes a very long way, I might add."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might stands to his feet, raising a fist high into the air.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You ponder the situation.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "On to the search!"
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You say to Gerolith, God of Might, "Good lucK!"
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus smiles and says, "T'was a pleasurable meat and drink, sir. And words
exchanged with relish."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You kiss Gerolith, God of Might gently on the lips.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You wink.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You tell Juanope Sunjackal, "And there is my bold story for this month."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juanope gives you a shifty little smile.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You gulp down a mixed cocktail, wetting your palate.
With a great amount of effort, you manage to drink some of the thick liquid,
coughing as the drink slowly makes its way down, the wood chips and leaves
within it rough against your throat.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juanope tells you, "Indeed."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Your eyes sparkle with amusement at Juanope.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juanope tells you, "I'm going to keep that one."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juanope nods sagely at you.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Fare thee well, Ithaquans! And if I should find
her a dream and nothing more, perhaps I shall return here for a wife."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might waggles his eyebrows comically.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
You give a trillingly melodic laugh.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might winks at you.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juanope Sunjackal says to Gerolith, God of Might, "Good luck!"
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Sommnus grins mischievously at Gerolith, God of Might.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Gerolith, God of Might waves goodbye.
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Juanope Sunjackal smiles impishly and says, "Or not."
&lt;307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x &lt;ebpp> &lt;bd>>
Stumbling slightly, Gerolith leaves to the out.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
