You drift along the waves of your music to arrive at your waymark.
Within the Kinsarmar Gate. (road).
A large silver obelisk stands here, mystic runes glimmering on its surface. A shimmering scroll of pure silver hovers slowing in mid-air before you, suspended with a crystal of pure amethyst. A welcoming marble statue rests here, prominently displaying three figures as a protective symbol to
Kinsarmar. The shrunken head of Iriaen has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Ryax has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Dyanea has been staked
into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon her face. The shrunken head of Braefer has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his face.The caustic smell of chemicals used in his profession surrounds Jalin. An elite Guardswoman of
Kinsarmar is manning a cannon here. She has forty-eight cannon balls. With a wild look in his eye, a feral paint stallion stands heatedly here as he stomps and paces recklessly.
You see exits leading north, northwest, and the shining Kinsarmar Gate leading southeast (gate open)</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+3 points with 3 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92467a33c20ef4c2d82bb7101089334b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dgroz093@xxx on 19 Dec 2011</p>Highlight: Vilkas valiantly trying to hinder your escape by comboing himself with aconite.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0291a478a1ec22e62260b677a3feef4d?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by steel.imperian@xxx (author) on 19 Dec 2011</p>I know.
