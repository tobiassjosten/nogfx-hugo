Rock covered cave.
The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an 
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken 
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is 
littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a 
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another 
path in the southeast of this chamber. You see exits leading east, southeast, 
and up.

Collapsed wall.
Part of the wall surrounding the arena stood the test of time fairly well, 
forming the frame of this room as it leans against harder rock. Triangularly 
shaped, the hard surface of the wall has long been covered with moss, but here 
there the mortar lines of the original construction can be seen. Incredibly 
large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with 
confidence and aloofness. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked 
and alert. The undead form of Myrmidon Nael is here. She wields a curved sabre 
in her left hand and a tower shield in her right. Hands of rotting flesh and 
white bone push up from the ground. 
You see exits leading southeast and northwest.

Rock covered cave. (Southwestern Arena.)
The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an 
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken 
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is 
littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a 
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another 
path in the southeast of this chamber. The undead form of Myrmidon Nael is 
here. She wields a curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her 
right.
You see exits leading east, southeast, and up.

Collapsed wall. (Southwestern Arena.)
Part of the wall surrounding the arena stood the test of time fairly well, 
forming the frame of this room as it leans against harder rock. Triangularly 
shaped, the hard surface of the wall has long been covered with moss, but here 
there the mortar lines of the original construction can be seen. Incredibly 
large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with 
confidence and aloofness. The undead form of Myrmidon Nael is here. She wields 
a curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her right.

Debris-choked underground path. (Southwestern Arena.)
A small path connects two chambers of this underground system, very tight and 
narrow but with a fairly high ceiling. Rubble from the collapse of the arena 
grounds is strewn throughout the entire path, nearly blocking the narrow path 
at twists and turns. High above, the ceiling consists of packed dirt, the tree 
roots that poke through at regular intervals clearly form the base upon which 
the dirt is settled. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and 
alert.
You see exits leading east and northwest.

Collapsed wall. (lost) (Southwestern Arena.)
Part of the wall surrounding the arena stood the test of time fairly well, 
forming the frame of this room as it leans against harder rock. Triangularly 
shaped, the hard surface of the wall has long been covered with moss, but here 
there the mortar lines of the original construction can be seen. Incredibly 
large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with 
confidence and aloofness. The undead form of Myrmidon Nael is here. She wields 
a curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her right. Hands of

Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here

Rock covered cave.
The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an

littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another
path in the southeast of this chamber. You see exits leading east, southeast,

Collapsed wall.
Part of the wall surrounding the arena stood the test of time fairly well,
forming the frame of this room as it leans against harder rock. Triangularly
shaped, the hard surface of the wall has long been covered with moss, but here
there the mortar lines of the original construction can be seen. Incredibly
large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with
confidence and aloofness. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked
and alert. The undead form of Myrmidon Nael is here. She wields a curved sabre
in her left hand and a tower shield in her right. Hands of rotting flesh and
white bone push up from the ground.

Rock covered cave. (Southwestern Arena.)
The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is
littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another
path in the southeast of this chamber. The undead form of Myrmidon Nael is
here. She wields a curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her
right.
You see exits leading east, southeast, and up.

Collapsed wall. (Southwestern Arena.)
Part of the wall surrounding the arena stood the test of time fairly well,
forming the frame of this room as it leans against harder rock. Triangularly
shaped, the hard surface of the wall has long been covered with moss, but here
there the mortar lines of the original construction can be seen. Incredibly
large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with
confidence and aloofness. The undead form of Myrmidon Nael is here. She wields
a curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her right.

A small path connects two chambers of this underground system, very tight and
narrow but with a fairly high ceiling. Rubble from the collapse of the arena
grounds is strewn throughout the entire path, nearly blocking the narrow path
at twists and turns. High above, the ceiling consists of packed dirt, the tree
roots that poke through at regular intervals clearly form the base upon which
the dirt is settled. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and
alert.

there the mortar lines of the original construction can be seen. Incredibly

You move in towards Nael for the backbreaker.
You lift Nael triumphantly into the air, then yank her down into your raised
knee with back breaking force.
The decaying hands retreat back into the comfort of the earth.
With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, Nael's head lolls aimlessly far
too far to one side. Nael collapses into such an undignified sprawl that you
realise that the throw did indeed snap the spine like a dry twig.
You have slain Nael.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+2 points with 2 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92467a33c20ef4c2d82bb7101089334b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dgroz093@xxx on 19Â Aug 2010</p><obligatory comment about monk being like having a bike with training wheels and your dad to hold you steady but deciding not to risk it and just crawling instead.><p>Also &lt;3</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92467a33c20ef4c2d82bb7101089334b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dgroz093@xxx on 19Â Aug 2010</p><ul><li>Obligatory comment about playing the monk class being like having a bike with training wheels and both parents to hold you steady but deciding to crawl instead just to be on the safe side -</li></ul></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx (author) on 19Â Aug 2010</p>Hehe, that might well be true, but it&rsquo;s only as bad as all of the other gimpy classes.
