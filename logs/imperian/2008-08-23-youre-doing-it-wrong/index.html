has been hung here, its tassels swaying gently in the breeze. Miranda and 
Porcelecus are lying on a comfortable rope hammock. You see a single exit leading
bugeye
Your eyes bug out of your head in wonder.

Miranda, Initiate of the Sanguine moans loudly and claws at your back. Her back
arches and her eyes roll back into her head in ecstasy as she feels every inch 
of your cock sliding into her tight, wet pussy. Her breathing becomes heavier 
as she grinds her hips against yours, pushing you further into her.

Porcelecus, Initiate of the Sanguine thrusts in and out of you faster and 
harder, he bites down on your neck, and digs his nails into your back, he is 
panting rapidly, you hear him barely moan, "Mirrandaa... You.. Are.. 
Amazinggg....".
 
You have emoted: Kraven waits for you to fail at sex more.
You have recovered balance.

Miranda, Initiate of the Sanguine clinches up tightly around you as every inch 
of you slides in and out of her. She plays with her tits and moans loudly as as
she tugs on her nipples. Her pussy becomes dripping wet as you continue to fuck
her.  "Pl...please..harder..." she moans as she attempts to catch her breath.

 
 
You roll on the floor in front of Porcelecus, laughing.
You urge Porcelecus onwards.

You urge Porcelecus onwards.

Porcelecus, Initiate of the Sanguine begins thrusting into you as hard and fast
as he can, jarring your body with every thrust inwards, be bends down, and 
bites down on one of your nipples, moaning your name loudly, you feel his cock 
begin to swell up.

Miranda, Initiate of the Sanguine screams your name as she begins to cum all 
over your cock. Her back arches as far as it can while she screams in pleasure.
You feel her nails rake down your arms as she moans loudly "Oh 
gods..keep..going..".

Porcelecus, Initiate of the Sanguine Thrusts his cock into you as deep as he 
possibly can, as it begins to twitch, and pulsate, you feel a warm sensation, 
as his jism erupts from the tip of his shaft, load after load filling you up, 
his cock and jism fill you up so much, that his cum begins to seep out of your 
pussy around his cock, he screams your name, then leans down and pants into 
your ear, "Will you be mine?".


Cyron arrives from the southeast.

Cyron doffs his hat cordially.

Porcelecus coughs softly.

Miranda blushes as she hides her face in her hands in embarrassment.

Porcelecus, Initiate of the Sanguine says, "Yes?"

Knight Aspirant Cyron Ashtear says, "Doing it wrong."

Your surroundings shatter into a cloud of glowing stars which dissipate to 
leave you back where you began.
 You say, "Your form was all wrong."

You cough softly.

Knight Aspirant Cyron Ashtear says to you, "They did it wrong, right?"

 You nod your head.

Porcelecus glares angrily at you.
 
Miranda smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

Knight Aspirant Cyron Ashtear says to Miranda, "Less arching."

Miranda flips you the bird.

You nod your head.
Miranda gives a trillingly melodic laugh.

You say, "Way too common."

Miranda blinks.

Porcelecus stands up from a comfortable rope hammock.
