Cold and silent, and shrouded in snow, Ithaqua is a harsh and bleak place,
wrought with danger. Surrounded by the low-lying mountains, Ithaqua was lost to
the world of Aetherius for centuries until a band of exiled Khandavans came
upon it. Accepted by the old war-hound, Fenrir Lyesmith, they rebuilt the
ruined village upon the ideals of its people and ancient bloodlines.

15.5 PLAYER KILLING

The emotional response and drama created from the possibility of one character
killing another is unsurpassed in Imperian. Without this level of involvement,
Imperian would not be the rich and realistic world that it is. Death is hardly
a permanent thing, but the risk of it makes the game entertaining on many
levels, and more importantly, opens up huge areas of roleplay for those wishing
to pursue a darker lifestyle. In turn, those wishing to pursue a lifestyle to
counter this are given more opportunities, and so on.

The Gods benevolently provide a means by which you can avoid all hostile
activities, although we suggest you give them a try at least once. Please see
HELP GRACE.

In an effort to enhance the freedom of roleplay in the game, we deliberately do
not set out hard and fast laws to govern player killing. The following rules
and guidelines apply to those wishing to partake in the roleplay of attacking
and killing other characters:

1) Killing for roleplay reasons is permitted, and the only acceptable reason
for any killing in Imperian. Those characters with a consistent roleplay and
decent character history will be seen as more reliable when it comes to issues
of trust with the Administration. The onus is on you as a player to show that
your character is killing for a good roleplay reason. Killing just because you
are a &#39;pschyo mad killer&#39; is likely to get you in trouble. Do not kill someone
repeatedly (more than once) for one reason. If you still need to damage a
character, try politics or something other than killing.

- Killing someone because they are slaughtering innocent villagers (NPCs) in a
local village is absolutely good roleplay. UNLESS you then go and kill those

You have already summoned Arctar, the Defender.

same villagers yourself just for &#39;good experience&#39;. In fact, this sort of
inconsistency is likely to bring down the anger of the Administration.

2) A real life day is an Imperian Month. Killing after several RL days have
passed since the incident which would have caused your character anger is
frowned upon. It would need to be a very big reason to still want your enemy
dead after several months. Do not be surprised if you are punished by
Administrators for breaking this obvious rule.

3) Players who have developed a background and history (HELP BACKGROUND, HELP
HISTORY) that shows why they would be killing certain people for doing certain
things will be seen as far more reliable than those who have not. We do
maintain decent records of how well you roleplay in your everyday life.

- If you tell us your character claims to hate dwarves, why should we believe
you unless you can show us that he always has?

4) PK is one of a number of viable ways to resolve something. If you are
continually finding yourself resorting to violence to resolve problems, you can
be sure that the Administration will have noticed too. PK-ing from the moment
you log in, to the moment you log out, is hardly good roleplay at all. Indeed,
if it is decided that you do less roleplay than killing, you will be punished
for killing. Once again, it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVE YOU ARE ROLEPLAYING
OUT A CHARACTER.

5) When an Admin makes a decision regarding PK, it is final. The Administration
are not similar to the in-character Gods of the realm. The Admins are here as
entirely OOC entities to resolve your problems when you cannot do so for
yourself. Therefore, your God may well encourage you to kill your enemies, but
they will also expect you to stick to the guidelines here. When deciding on an

issue, the Admin in question will not care about which city your character
lives in, or who your characters friends are. They care only for fairness and
equality. They will take your (administrative) history into account. Every
situation is different, do not expect Administration to rule the same way over
two incidents that although similar, involve different people or different
circumstances.

NOTE : In Imperian, one does not "Gain PK" on someone. Nor do we have a system
of "PK tokens" like some games. In Imperian, you are expected to behave and
roleplay like an Adult, with sensibility and rationality. If the moment when
your character may wish someone dead has passed, then move on. Clinging to the
idea of a &#39;free kill&#39; will be noticed by the Administration and is likely to
get you punished. Doing something stupid is also likely to get you punished -
try not to be stupid!

Cold and silent, and shrouded in snow, Ithaqua is a harsh and bleak place,
wrought with danger. Surrounded by the low-lying mountains, Ithaqua was lost to
the world of Aetherius for centuries until a band of exiled Khandavans came
upon it. Accepted by the old war-hound, Fenrir Lyesmith, they rebuilt the
ruined village upon the ideals of its people and ancient bloodlines.

15.5 PLAYER KILLING
The emotional response and drama created from the possibility of one character
killing another is unsurpassed in Imperian. Without this level of involvement,
Imperian would not be the rich and realistic world that it is. Death is hardly
a permanent thing, but the risk of it makes the game entertaining on many
levels, and more importantly, opens up huge areas of roleplay for those wishing
to pursue a darker lifestyle. In turn, those wishing to pursue a lifestyle to
counter this are given more opportunities, and so on.
The Gods benevolently provide a means by which you can avoid all hostile
activities, although we suggest you give them a try at least once. Please see
HELP GRACE.
In an effort to enhance the freedom of roleplay in the game, we deliberately do
not set out hard and fast laws to govern player killing. The following rules
and guidelines apply to those wishing to partake in the roleplay of attacking
and killing other characters:
1) Killing for roleplay reasons is permitted, and the only acceptable reason
for any killing in Imperian. Those characters with a consistent roleplay and
decent character history will be seen as more reliable when it comes to issues
of trust with the Administration. The onus is on you as a player to show that
your character is killing for a good roleplay reason. Killing just because you
are a 'pschyo mad killer' is likely to get you in trouble. Do not kill someone
repeatedly (more than once) for one reason. If you still need to damage a
character, try politics or something other than killing.
- Killing someone because they are slaughtering innocent villagers (NPCs) in a
local village is absolutely good roleplay. UNLESS you then go and kill those

You have already summoned Arctar, the Defender.
H:400/400(0) M:564/580(0) E:1718 W:2533 XP:4 &lt;eb bd>&lt;arvus> &lt;22:41:58:105> more
same villagers yourself just for 'good experience'. In fact, this sort of
inconsistency is likely to bring down the anger of the Administration.
2) A real life day is an Imperian Month. Killing after several RL days have
passed since the incident which would have caused your character anger is
frowned upon. It would need to be a very big reason to still want your enemy
dead after several months. Do not be surprised if you are punished by
Administrators for breaking this obvious rule.
3) Players who have developed a background and history (HELP BACKGROUND, HELP
HISTORY) that shows why they would be killing certain people for doing certain
things will be seen as far more reliable than those who have not. We do
maintain decent records of how well you roleplay in your everyday life.
- If you tell us your character claims to hate dwarves, why should we believe
you unless you can show us that he always has?
4) PK is one of a number of viable ways to resolve something. If you are
continually finding yourself resorting to violence to resolve problems, you can
be sure that the Administration will have noticed too. PK-ing from the moment
you log in, to the moment you log out, is hardly good roleplay at all. Indeed,
if it is decided that you do less roleplay than killing, you will be punished
for killing. Once again, it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVE YOU ARE ROLEPLAYING
OUT A CHARACTER.
5) When an Admin makes a decision regarding PK, it is final. The Administration
are not similar to the in-character Gods of the realm. The Admins are here as
entirely OOC entities to resolve your problems when you cannot do so for
yourself. Therefore, your God may well encourage you to kill your enemies, but
they will also expect you to stick to the guidelines here. When deciding on an

issue, the Admin in question will not care about which city your character
lives in, or who your characters friends are. They care only for fairness and
equality. They will take your (administrative) history into account. Every
situation is different, do not expect Administration to rule the same way over
two incidents that although similar, involve different people or different
circumstances.
NOTE : In Imperian, one does not "Gain PK" on someone. Nor do we have a system
of "PK tokens" like some games. In Imperian, you are expected to behave and
roleplay like an Adult, with sensibility and rationality. If the moment when
your character may wish someone dead has passed, then move on. Clinging to the
idea of a 'free kill' will be noticed by the Administration and is likely to
get you punished. Doing something stupid is also likely to get you punished -
try not to be stupid!
