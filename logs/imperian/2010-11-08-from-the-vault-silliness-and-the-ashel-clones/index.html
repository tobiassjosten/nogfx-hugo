Aryana&#39;s Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Gore 
is splattered about, a display of Garryn&#39;s cruel handiwork. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass 
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small 
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The decapitated head of Alexio has
been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tossing his 
majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A
pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is 
here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. There are 2 maidenhair 
leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the 
Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. Floating in the air 
is a fiery portal. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect 
of Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a lunar shield in his 
right. He is surrounded by 189 reflections of himself. Jundi Lyon Zaridiux is

Aryana&#39;s Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Gore 
is splattered about, a display of Garryn&#39;s cruel handiwork. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass 
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small 
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The decapitated head of Alexio has
been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tossing his 
majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A

Aryana&#39;s Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The waters here have 
been miraculously parted. Gore is splattered about, a display of Garryn&#39;s cruel
handiwork. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a 
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil 
lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A 
well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan 
Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a 
goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite 
sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an 
ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean 
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble 
foam about its mouth. A small sign points into a market stall. A length of 
sturdy rope has been dropped here. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion
stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The 
decapitated head of Alexio has been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large 
and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence 
and aloofness. Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley
stands here impassively. A pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal 
heart, still dripping blood is here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left 
here. There are 2 maidenhair leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands 
here, his gaze cast over the Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, 
lies here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect of 
Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a lunar shield in his 
right. He is surrounded by 189 reflections of himself.

crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of

stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The decapitated head of Alexio has
been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tossing his
majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A
pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is
here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. There are 2 maidenhair
leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the
Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. Floating in the air
is a fiery portal. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect
of Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a lunar shield in his
right. He is surrounded by 189 reflections of himself. Jundi Lyon Zaridiux is

is splattered about, a display of Garryn's cruel handiwork. The spring of
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the

leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the
Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. The shining figure
of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A peaceful aura fills the area,
emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his left

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Gore
is splattered about, a display of Garryn's cruel handiwork. The spring of
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The decapitated head of Alexio has
been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tossing his
majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A
pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is
here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. There are 2 maidenhair
leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the
Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. The shining figure
of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Jundi Lyon Zaridiux is riding on
an armoured battle stallion. He wields a Souledge Sabre in each hand. Scout
Alarick Zhek'coh, Student of the Wilds is here. He wields a lunar shield in his
left hand and an Axe of Asakan Fury in his right. A peaceful aura fills the
area, emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his

of himself.

Within the great Library of Caanae. (ruins of Caanae.)
There are 8 chunks of bone in a group here. A charred and bloodied chunk of
someone's head lies here, mostly just skullcap. Lying at your feet is a
bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and throbbing with life. Smoke issues from
this mutilated leg, the skin peeled back by scorching heat. The burnt remnant
of someone's ear lies on the ground. Busily examining the library, Mathardan
the Loresage wanders about. There are 2 monolith sigils here. Resting on the
ground is a fist-shaped sigil. A dark mass of coalesced shadow lies here. A
silver ring, set with a shimmering sapphire, rests upon the ground. There are 2
amethyst encrusted silver rings here. Left to weather the elements, a dark
tower shield lies here. A straight-edged sabre lies here, abandoned. The
elegant form of a hornbow lies nearby. Its gray body limp, this fish is no
more. With nowhere to go, this yellowish perch has stopped breathing. A bream
lies dead here, its dark scales shimmering. There are 2 spotted walleyes here.
A brook trout lies here helpless, its life gone. The small mouth of this bass
unmoving, it lies dead. There are 2 Girdle of the Titans here. A well-crafted
quiver has been left on the floor here. There are 7 Armband of Celerities here.
There are 2 mortal hearts here. A valuable wand of reflection has been
carelessly discared here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring
at you with its many eyes. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm
sets its beady eyes on you. A massive groomed black stallion stands here
proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. The shining figure of
a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Hands of rotting flesh and white
bone push up from the ground. This is a library. Jundi Lyon Zaridiux is here.
He wields a Souledge Sabre in each hand. Aeorden Kei'daan is here, shrouded. He
wields a lunar shield in his left hand and a Sukhder daegger in his right.

A rose-lined path to the library. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Light pink wings
keeping her off the ground, a girl cherubim is giggling here. A small sign
points into a market stall. A massive, wild tiger with fierce, emerald eyes
prowls the immediate area for prey. A large cylindrical shield is propped
nearby. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes
on you.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The waters here have
been miraculously parted. Gore is splattered about, a display of Garryn's cruel
handiwork. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil
lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A
well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan
Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a
goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite
sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an
ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble
foam about its mouth. A small sign points into a market stall. A length of
sturdy rope has been dropped here. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion
stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The
decapitated head of Alexio has been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large
and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence
and aloofness. Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley
stands here impassively. A pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal
heart, still dripping blood is here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left
here. There are 2 maidenhair leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands
here, his gaze cast over the Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity,
lies here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect of
Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a lunar shield in his
right. He is surrounded by 189 reflections of himself.
