It has been established in previous announce posts that killing a person based on their affiliation is in fact illegal, it has also been stated by Dranor that killing a person simply because of their class is against the rules (as class is a game mechanic, and one that is extremely costly to simply &#34;give up&#34;). Siath has stated his intention to kill me repeatedly due to my &#34;unapproved&#34; holding of the class of monk (which by merely having it have fufilled all the requirements laid down by the game) and has now offered Guild Favours for my head, which is also a violation of the rules (all assassinations should go through the cloaked figures). I'd like Siath reminded of these facts and punished accordingly

Greetings, Garden. Yes another issue that does nothing but waste time. Perhaps Sani needs a lesson in what RP is, and what PK is. Sani a well known traitor to both Antioch and the Taekyons. Sani also been in Stavenn helping Stavennites with his MONK profession. What Sani doesn't get is that killing someone because of class or organizations is when someone kills everyone in the saboteur guild because they are at war with Stavenn. However, this is not the case. Telling someone to &#34;drop class&#34; as they possess an anti-magick class outside the guild is not against the rules, you can't force anyone to do it. However, I expected Sani to atleast be able to RP enough to understand that his actions AND the fact that he is holding our profession outside the guild will get him killed. This has been the case with all the people leaving a guild but keeping the class, even before professions came around. Sani also recently started to try to fool members of the Taekyon which is just another reason to why Siath would want him dead. If Sani doesn't want to lose class, fine don't, but he shouldn't run around and issue people thinking he's behind some divine grace because he betrayed and kept his class. Your actions will cause others to kill you. This is like Nhu trying to issue someone after robbing the guild for almost 8 millions. Actions = Consequences. This is the RP I want to keep.">Issue #17019 Reported by: Sani Re: Siath
