A richly decorated tent.
The inside of the tent contrasts the bleak exterior, richly decorated with 
shimmering silks, exotic decorative woodwork, and the delicate scent of 
cinnamon incense in the air. In the very centre of the tent is a large chest, 
bound with truesilver, with a slot to place gold and another to dispense 
tickets. A small sign suspended from the roof reads &#39;Read HELP LOTTERY for 
information.&#39;. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, 
giving off a soft light. Dias is here. He wields a Spellscourge sitara in his 
left hand.
