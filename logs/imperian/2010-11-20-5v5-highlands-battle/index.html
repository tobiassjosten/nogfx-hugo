Hovering in the centre of this room, a massive, obsidian crystal spins slowly 
as its dark energy radiates throughout the area. Tongue flicking out rapidly a 
black-spotted anaconda slithers around here. Eyes alert and claws at the ready,
a fierce wolverine stands his ground. Audible sounds of quacking reverberate 
from a wood duck here. A dark crow perches nearby, glaring at your every move. 
Pale eyes shining, a spotted lynx paces here restlessly. Gazing serenely from 
its perch, a graceful gyrfalcon surveys the area. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. An undulating mass of water, 
cascading and swirling into itself, has settled here. Anaya Elith is here, 
camouflaged. Lord Ozreas al-Hamasa is here, camouflaged. Cadeyrn, Aspect of 
Sukhder, is here, filling the surroundings with a miasma of fear. He wields a 
spiritual mace in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Chameroslin 
Lorianis, Magus of Earth is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left 
hand.
You see a single exit leading out.

large pile of golden sovereigns rests on the ground. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A raven the colour of night perches 
nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Silent and observant, a 
red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. 
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. Hackles raised,
an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. A grumpy badger stands here, 
snuffling about angrily. Tongue flicking out rapidly a black-spotted anaconda 
slithers around here. Eyes alert and claws at the ready, a fierce wolverine 
stands his ground. Audible sounds of quacking reverberate from a wood duck 
here. A dark crow perches nearby, glaring at your every move. Pale eyes 
shining, a spotted lynx paces here restlessly. Gazing serenely from its perch, 
a graceful gyrfalcon surveys the area. Sir Nasr von-Schweitzer, Artisan of Lore
and Steel is here. He is rapidly swinging a sword above his head. Lord Ozreas 
al-Hamasa is here, camouflaged. Anaya Elith is here, camouflaged. General Dias 
Tethe'alla, Archmagus of Fire is here, surrounded by a aura of black flames. He

A hidden mine shaft. (lost) (Vorrak Mines.)
This simple shaft tunnels into the mountain about thirty feet before coming to 
an abrupt halt. The floor is blanketed with bat droppings and small bones. 
Hovering in the centre of this room, a massive, obsidian crystal spins slowly 
as its dark energy radiates throughout the area. Twinkling and gleaming, a 
large pile of golden sovereigns rests on the ground. There are 5 maidenhair 
leaves in 2 groups here. There are 4 orphine seeds in 3 groups here. The 
shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A raven the 
colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. 
Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a 
cunning glint of the eye. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers 
under your feet. Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits 
about the room. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. 
A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Tongue flicking out 
rapidly a black-spotted anaconda slithers around here. Eyes alert and claws at 
the ready, a fierce wolverine stands his ground. Audible sounds of quacking 
reverberate from a wood duck here. A dark crow perches nearby, glaring at your 
every move. Pale eyes shining, a spotted lynx paces here restlessly. Gazing 
serenely from its perch, a graceful gyrfalcon surveys the area. Lord Ozreas 
al-Hamasa is here, camouflaged. Cadeyrn, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling 
the surroundings with a miasma of fear. He wields a spiritual mace in his left 
hand and a tower shield in his right. Sir Nasr von-Schweitzer, Artisan of Lore 
and Steel is here. He is rapidly swinging a sword above his head. General Dias 
Tethe'alla, Archmagus of Fire is here, surrounded by a aura of black flames. He
wields Sabre of the Magi in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. 
Knight Apprentice Gabriel Shinohara is here. He wields an alabaster sabre in 
his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
