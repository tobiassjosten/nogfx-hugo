Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin 
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of 
utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in 
ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man 
with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue 
of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the 
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.
A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A 
small sign points into a market stall. A shaggy grey mustang roams warily 
nearby. A massive groomed black stallion stands here proudly, its large form 
covered in silver battle armour. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast 
over the Springs. A mug of syrupy liquid sits nearby. A sleek black hound 
stands stone still, ears perked and alert. There are 2 Seraphic guardians here.
A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. Pareze is here, a blank look in 
her eyes. She is holding a tower shield in her left hand. Executor 
Vasharnashar, of the Frozen North is here. He wields an ivory sitara in his 
left hand. Justus Sunjackal is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left 
hand and a tower shield in his right. Will of Vis'Ahl Enteri Landstrider is
