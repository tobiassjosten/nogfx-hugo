Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass 
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small 
sign points into a market stall. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man 
with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. The corpse of Sidartha is here,
impaled by a narrow bone. A note on it reads, &#39;This is the end of those who 
would trifle with Menoch.&#39;  Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over 
the Springs. Sani, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the surroundings with a 
miasma of fear.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The spring of
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small
sign points into a market stall. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man
with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. The corpse of Sidartha is here,
impaled by a narrow bone. A note on it reads, 'This is the end of those who
would trifle with Menoch.' Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over
the Springs. Sani, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the surroundings with a
miasma of fear.

A beatific look of bliss appears on Dias's face as his ears begin to harden and
turn to pure marble. The marble quickly spreads over his face and down his
neck, turning his entire form white. After his entire body has been completely

imprinting a short passage onto it.
You have slain Dias.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+5 points with 5 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71fbf7d9749e2cbccd9e5f30c1ac9b07?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by r.monroe18@xxx on 13Â May 2010</p>Lol seeing Dias die never gets old</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6144f1e88e5225310dc304b44dd9abc?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by hrfrioniel@xxx on 14Â May 2010</p>Classic Dias!</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3fd57273d1cd45f320a85ecd7ad20bec?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by falcon32252003@xxx (author) on 14Â May 2010</p><p>My favorite part,</p><p>Dias tells you, &ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo;
