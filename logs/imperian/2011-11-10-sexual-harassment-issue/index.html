Hello, I'll try to keep my emotions as much as I can out of this issue to be 
fair to everyone involved. However, I'm not going to let this kind of behavior happen to me, as it extremely upsets me beyond just in character and inhabits my ability (as a player) to play. I take sexual harassment extremely seriously, and I don't wish for this to escalate further, so I feel that this is the only way Cadeyrn's player will really understand how much I hate being treated like that. Karyn was standing out and fishing like she normally does, and Cadeyrn came out of nowhere and spanked her. She has hardly any interaction with Cadeyrn up until this point, so it was uncalled for. Cadeyrn left before Karyn could do anything, and she even tried to speak to him, and he responded that he will -try- not to do it again. I am extremely unhappy with that response, because I don't really thinks he understands the seriousness of sexual harassment but to try and ensure
that this behavior doesn't happen to me or anyone else, I am writing this issue.I hate being treated like that, more than anything else, and this extends far beyond how Karyn is IC. Nobody deserves to be treated like this.

It&rsquo;s not like she was calling upon a huge punishment, she&rsquo;s just simply saying she doesn&rsquo;t want it to happen again because NOBODY (including herself) should be treated like that. I&rsquo;m sure she did it with the intention of him stopping it. I&rsquo;ve been issued for worse things.

Anyone who has ever spent thirty seconds in any online game other than a MUD will tell you that homophobic slurs are utterly endemic. Further, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of IC ways to punish someone for language that&rsquo;s not offensive to an IC persona, but is to an OOC persona. Most people will agree that they&rsquo;d prefer to play in a game where OOC hate-speech isn&rsquo;t tolerated but wouldn&rsquo;t like to play in a game where individual predetermined emotes that are, by the way, entirely inline with the character of the too doing them are met with issues.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b08dd188d98ac46be41444f897281bba?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by blackgaardprankster@xxx on 19 Nov 2011</p><p>waaait, what? apparently &ldquo;you&rsquo;re only insulted by the word &lsquo;fag&rsquo; because you&rsquo;re gay&rdquo; is a logical statement?</p><p>cadeyrn, my man, what happened to your class?</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a69ddf32f2b192787a4fe98d7d34517e?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by punkprincess692@xxx on 19 Nov 2011</p>@kabaal you get raped????

But heck maybe I should have issued Akhan when he would waltz through the room spank Shalohan and continue on his way, but you know what it was RP he was making her feel less like a Woman cause she was a DEMONER. Come on people suck it up, not if his player were to have walked up and smacked your ass, then you have a valid complaint. But an IG action, that you can prevent???? <em>cries for Caderyn</em> poor fellow was just copping a feel :)
But then isn&rsquo;t logging a mudsexx log sexual harassment? I mean let alone copyrighted work? I mean unless you post your own logs? Cause if they are the creative writings of someone else&mldr;you plagiarized their works&mldr;shame on you. IRE worlds have alot of sexual harassment people get over it, its a GAME.
