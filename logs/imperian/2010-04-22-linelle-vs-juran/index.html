The arrow's fuse disappears within the black packet tied to the shaft, and all
is quiet for a moment. You don't even have time to witness your life flashing
before your eyes as the packet explodes violently, white fire the last thing you
see as your body is blown to nothing more than charred bone and vaporized flesh.
You have been slain by Linelle. (all)
You are OUT of the Free-For-All!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
There are 2 beehives here. A group of charcoal cinders lies here in a pile.
Majestic in both appearance and bearing, a giant panda stands here, warily
sniffing at her surroundings. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular
monolith is on the ground. There are 9 charred and jagged skullcaps here. There
are 9 mutilated legs here. There are 7 severed ears here. There are 7 gnarled
fingers here. Lying at your feet is a bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and
throbbing with life. There are 2 mortal hearts here. There are 23 corpses of a
swarm of bees here. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here.
You see a single exit leading down.

The part about the arena implies that I know you can&rsquo;t use up things there.

This is why you were being stupid. Because you didn&rsquo;t answer my question.
If taken in context then you would probably realize that the question was rhetorical and meant only to make Coolintro realize that they were illusions. So, probably you just took my post out of context. Thats why you were being retarded.</p><p>But, mostly you were being retarded because you assumed I had NO CLUE wtf I was talking about. Which along with wasting your time it pisses me off. If I don&rsquo;t understand something I will directly ask the question. Besides the fact that you know my character is Renac and you know that he is at least a few RL years old, knowing simple things like roomwide illusions and arena not using up resources are fairly basic things. Please don&rsquo;t take too much offense to me saying &lsquo;you were being retarded&rsquo;.
