A resplendent gardenia bush is elegantly set into a polished silver basin, lending a
graceful beauty to the area. A tiny dragonfly, wrought in silver and rose quartz is positioned just above a fragrant white bloom. With a marshmallow scent tinged in the air  around it, a powder blue candle has been extravangently placed here. Entrancingly placed in the room, someone has put a bread loaf shaped candle here. Velvety pink rose petals have been scattered here, their delicate fragrance perfuming the air. A partially open shimmering pink basket has been placed here, the light scent of gardenias wafting to the air from inside of it.

The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Malikye is sitting on the ground. Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love is here with a gentle smile on Her Face, nude except for pink and white rose petals that conceal Her modesty.
You see a single exit leading down.
You are transported by the will of the gods.
Malikye beams broadly.
Shallah flashes Malikye a joyous smile.
Malikye inclines his head, piously clasping his hands before him and bows to Shallah respectfully.
Shallah gives Malikye a compassionate hug.
Malikye raises his hand in greeting and says "Hello!"
Malikye gives Shallah a compassionate hug.
An opalescent light shines forth from Lady Shallah, when it dims all that is left is a vague outline of a shaply figure and a lingering scent of gardenias.fluffy pink cloud.There are 3 small white clouds here. An exquisite throne wreathed in divine fire and decorated with gardenia blossoms and cherubim statuettes. A silver chest rests upon the ground here. A resplendent gardenia bush is elegantly set into a polished silver basin, lending a graceful beauty to the area. A tiny dragonfly, wrought in silver and rose quartz is positioned just above a fragrant white bloom.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love is here with a gentle smile on Her Face, nude except for pink and white rose petals that conceal Her modesty.
There are no obvious exits.
You are transported by the will of the gods.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Ok well first of all, how are you doing?"
You say, "I am well, Lady Epiphany has blessed me this month."

You say to Shallah, "And you Lady?"
You say to Shallah, "My Blessed Guide says, hello."
Shallah&#39;s mouth turns up as Her face breaks into a smile.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I am wonderful, worried about you though."

You tilt your head curiously.
You peer at yourself unscrupulously.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I feel as though I somehow upset you and I wouldn&#39;twant that for you."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Why don&#39;t you tell Me what is going on that has upset you."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "You are in a place of Peace, you are safe and free to speak your mind."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I won&#39;t judge you nor will I smite you."
Shallah flashes you a joyous smile.
Shallah gives a pink carnation to you.
You say to Shallah, "You judged my Pureness in front of a crowd, stating that I was impure. This was deeply hurtful, as I follow Lord Illuminas, The Pure One. Only He in my heart should be able to judge that, I mean for Him to judge me on my lovingness and peacefulness would be like stepping on Your toes. And he would not do that. I was just hurt that you stated those things aloud."

You are now wearing a pink carnation.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says to you, "I can understand why you are hurt and I need you to know that I said you aren&#39;t pure of Peace, which I am sure your Lord will agree. There are many forms of Pureness and variations and your Lord and I get along very well in our ideals about things and the way that We feel about mortals. I would never want to 
upset you or cause you harm or grief, you and your Lord know your intentions and your heart. I simply know that any mortal that embraces Violence can&#39;t understand enough about Peace to judge it properly, if I&#39;ve embarrassed you in any way I would wish to take it back but that is the thing about embarrassment, it makes mortals stronger. Especially you,
I see a lot of good things coming from you."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I certainly did not speak it very well in a way that wouldn&#39;t harm you and for that, I am sorry Kailynn."
Shallah flashes you a joyous smile.
A savage grey wolf trots in, panting slightly.
A giant gardenia blossom blooms from the floor, and as the petals spread in the centre is revealed Lady Shallah.
"I&#39;m sorry!" Shallah says with a blush.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "If you said anything, I missed it."
You say to Shallah, "I have fought for my Pureness, I only killed the one that had taken my own life, and my Grandfather&#39;s life. Had Ekitsu not attacked and kill me and my grandfather, my hands would be pure of violence as well. It hurt that you judged me, when it was the first time that you had met me. I have tried to reason it out, even speaking 
with other Divine. And They agreed with me that My pureness can only be judged by Lord Illuminas, as He is The Pure One for a reason, us mortals have noted Him as such. I humbly accept Your apology. Although, as the insult was publicly ....maybe publicly stating that You misjudged me... might be fitting."
You scuff your foot on the ground, attempting to look at Shallah innocently, and failing.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I am a Goddess, you are lucky that I apologized to you, as everything I do has an intent and a purpose."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "You are going to be stronger because of it, you don&#39;t need a Goddess to tell everyone who you are or aren&#39;t, that is in your hands."

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "If someone says something about you that you feel isn&#39;t true, prove it isn&#39;t true with your actions."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I teach this to My Children all the time, because they are always being misjudged or taught humilaty."

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I don&#39;t mind telling you, I am always misjudged by others, it doesn&#39;t really bother Me though. Lord Illuminas is often misjudged, how do you feel he would handle the situation?"

You say, "So You&#39;re saying that, its okay to make judgments just because it makes mortals stronger? But how can you preach this when I am Pure of Mind, Pure of Body. And You the Goddess of Love and Peace, have taken the life of a mortal.... how can you judge me?"

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "You are the one who thinks I am bothered by your judgements of Me and I&#39;m not, it&#39;s not for your mortal mind to understand why I do what I do."

You say, "We both have taken the life of another, You are as unclean, impure, and unpeaceful as I. I seek answers and You speak in riddles."

Shallah gives a trillingly melodic laugh.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says to you, "I am a Goddess, you are a mortal. I don&#39;t think you grasp this concept yet, you don&#39;t understand anything about Me and you can&#39;t. If you want Me to speak to your Lord about you, so be it. I was hoping to enlighten you a little to not be so easily hurt by things."

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I don&#39;t speak in riddles, I speak in a way that forces you to think."
Shallah taps Her nose knowingly.

You say, "Miichelle is my soon to be Grand-mother, I came here, for her sake. She wishes me to see You in the glorious Peaceful Light that You have shown her. I just don&#39;t get that You do not see that you are wrong, Lady Epiphany agreed that You had no right to judge me the way that you did. I seek knowledge, I seek understanding. But You are trying to hide that fact that You have just as much blood on Your hands as I."

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Well that is how Lady Epiphany feels and that is fine, however, you aren&#39;t listening Kailynn. How can I put this so a mortal mind that is only hearing what it wants will get this, you aren&#39;t pure in a Peaceful way there is no way that you can be."

You say, "Nor are You, You have taken just as many lives as I."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "You can be Pure in all other aspects of your life and I think that is great for you, Peace is different."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says to you, "You don&#39;t get it and I can&#39;t speak it to you clearer than I am a Goddess, you are a mortal."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Do you not understand what this means?"
Shallah tilts Her head curiously.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I have a much higher understanding of Peace than your mortal mind could handle, than any mortal mind could handle. So why do you think you know more of it than I?"

You say, "I am a Peaceful person, but to be called out by a Divine that has never met me before. I understand that You are hiding behind, the "I&#39;m a God!", "La LA la la la I can&#39;t hear you cause I am a God!" Cause YOU yes YOU took a LIFE just as I HAD that means that YOU are just AS IMPURE as I."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Yes, you certainly aren&#39;t acting like a mortal child in the slightest."
You say, "I am getting irritated that YOU can&#39;t admit that You are as IMPURE as You stated I was."

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Tantrum throw all you like, it is not Me hiding behind anything. Mortals make fun of Me and judge Me all the time, what you don&#39;t get is that I AM PEACE. I am the essence of Peace and if you think you are Peaceful, you are far from it. You only wish to fight, you only wish to argue."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "You are not pure in a Peaceful way."
You say, "A death is a death no matter who commits it."
You tap your nose knowingly.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I won&#39;t take it back, it is My realm and I know it."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Judging a God, you are lucky I am not Lord Baar."
"Tsk, tsk," Shallah says as She waggles a finger and scolds the world.
You say "Psh!" derisively as you wave your hand dismissing the idea.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Is this how Lord Illuminas wants you to behave?"

You say, "Doubtful, but I am striving for the better of myself, You misjudged the wrong MORTAL."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Throwing a tantrum and argueing with a Goddess over her own mortal realm."
Shallah gives a trillingly melodic laugh.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "You make the mistake of thinking I care."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I was doing this for Miichelle."
You say, "I know that I am correct, you killed just as I have."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Cry about Me all you want, I won&#39;t give you another thought."
You say, "We are equal."
You tap your nose knowingly.
You drop to one knee, demonstrating your humility and respect.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Not equal in the slightest."
You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.
You roll on the floor in front of Shallah, laughing.

Brittany&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
Icarius chews idly on you.
You say, "Its official Lady Shallah is .... Impure."
Aryse&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
You tap your nose knowingly.
Neko Savann, the Blessed Guide says, "Peace is what she is."

Ryax tilts his head and listens intently to you.
You say, "I pointed out that she is as impure as I in the violence thing, as she herself has taken a life....all she did was "I&#39;m a God...alallalalallala I can&#39;t hear you"."
Icarius grins mischievously.
You shake your head sadly.'>Within the clouds under the arch of the rainbow.

Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Do you not understand what this means?"
Shallah tilts Her head curiously.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I have a much higher understanding of Peace than your mortal mind could handle, than any mortal mind could handle. So why do you think you know more of it than I?"
You say, "I am a Peaceful person, but to be called out by a Divine that has never met me before. I understand that You are hiding behind, the "I'm a God!", "La LA la la la I can't hear you cause I am a God!" Cause YOU yes YOU took a LIFE just as I HAD that means that YOU are just AS IMPURE as I."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Yes, you certainly aren't acting like a mortal child in the slightest."
You say, "I am getting irritated that YOU can't admit that You are as IMPURE as You stated I was."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Tantrum throw all you like, it is not Me hiding behind anything. Mortals make fun of Me and judge Me all the time, what you don't get is that I AM PEACE. I am the essence of Peace and if you think you are Peaceful, you are far from it. You only wish to fight, you only wish to argue."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "You are not pure in a Peaceful way."
You say, "A death is a death no matter who commits it."
You tap your nose knowingly.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I won't take it back, it is My realm and I know it."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Judging a God, you are lucky I am not Lord Baar."
"Tsk, tsk," Shallah says as She waggles a finger and scolds the world.
You say "Psh!" derisively as you wave your hand dismissing the idea.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Is this how Lord Illuminas wants you to behave?"
You say, "Doubtful, but I am striving for the better of myself, You misjudged the wrong MORTAL."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Throwing a tantrum and argueing with a Goddess over her own mortal realm."
Shallah gives a trillingly melodic laugh.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "You make the mistake of thinking I care."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "I was doing this for Miichelle."
You say, "I know that I am correct, you killed just as I have."
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Cry about Me all you want, I won't give you another thought."
You say, "We are equal."
You tap your nose knowingly.
You drop to one knee, demonstrating your humility and respect.
Shallah, Lady of Peace and Love says, "Not equal in the slightest."
You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.
You roll on the floor in front of Shallah, laughing.

You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and in.
Corpse Eater, the white crow gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.
You are transported by the will of the gods.
Brittany's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Icarius chews idly on you.
You say, "Its official Lady Shallah is .... Impure."
Aryse's eyes sparkle with amusement.
You tap your nose knowingly.
Neko Savann, the Blessed Guide says, "Peace is what she is."
Ryax tilts his head and listens intently to you.
You say, "I pointed out that she is as impure as I in the violence thing, as she herself has taken a life....all she did was "I'm a God...alallalalallala I can't hear you"."
Icarius grins mischievously.
You shake your head sadly.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>-9 points with 9 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7a1400875c7d459cc5b62085ce014a5?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by KaydenMidbere@xxx on 16 Dec 2011</p><p>I wish I could vote twice.</p><p>One -1 for Shallah, another -1 for Kailynn.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/301a5c8c2cd588071a817112d2674995?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by ahsanjaved123@xxx on 17 Dec 2011</p>Shallah wasn&rsquo;t able to argue much but you were being dumb too</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0291a478a1ec22e62260b677a3feef4d?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by steel.imperian@xxx on 06 Jan 2012</p><p>&ldquo;One -1 for Shallah, another -1 for Kailynn.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s being FAR too generous.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/beb8b10ef47041e2b802338b56bced3f?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by swarm514@xxx on 06 Jan 2012</p>Learn to edit so I can waste less time reading your crappy logs.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40a1a3db14a987eccc01794652079cf4?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by shadow_matrix0101@xxx on 20 May 2012</p>Congratulations. You are the reason why we have trouble keeping active Gods. What volunteer would wanna play a Divine that has to put up with that kinda crappy, disrespectful, argumentative, demanding tantrum? Lucky She was at least nice. Most of the Divine would&rsquo;ve raised a single eyebrow and then killed you. The Goddess of Peace can kill if that means the overall end result is maintaining peace, but normally it&rsquo;s a very last resort.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
