Past the gates of the Academia Sylvalis. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
wrought-iron gates of the Academia are now no more than a twisted mass of 
jagged metal. Very little of the elegant silver leaves that once adorned the 
gate remain, having been looted in the past. The pathway leading towards the 
rotting oak front doors is potholed and littered with iron spearheads and 
burned papyrus scrolls. Near the corner of the building is an overturned 
wheelbarrow, its cargo of garden utensils scattered amongst the tall grass. The
entryway has been torn down, its intricately carved wood columns leaning 
against each other to form a tenuous archway. A scroll has been fixed carefully
to the twisted metal of the gates.
You see exits leading east and west.

He is a lupine lycaean and is rather short for his race, standing at a mere 
five and a half feet tall. Dark brown fur covers his entire body, shaggy in 
texture. He's muscular, but lithe in movement and lean in structure, built more
for speed than strength, though wiry muscle can be seen beneath the fur and 
flesh, especially in his legs and forearms. Dark green eyes stare out from 
above an imposing muzzle with a wet black nose and ivory-white teeth, a large 
scar tracing the Lycaean's jawline the only thing marring his otherwise 
relatively (in a canine sense) handsome appearance. Lupine ears stand at the 
top of his head, and a short, shaggy tail dangles behind him as he walks. His 
stance is fluid, like water, and though he carries himself well he almost never
seems tense. He is wearing a subtle dark sitara wrist sheath, a pair of 
falcon-buckle boots, a dark wytch-hunter's trench coat, a flexible leather 
glove, a pouch woven from sea grass, a noble onyx ring, a soft black-fur cloak,
a worn headband of grimy leather, a woven belt of braided leather, an entwined 
platinum and gold engagement ring, a banded shield, an Ashtear family necklace,
a black forearm sheath, dark leather-strapped gloves, a golden Antioch signet 
ring, a handspun linen tunic, a pocketbelt, a snug leather thigh sheath, a 
leather helm, a pair of leather greaves, an ebon leather backpack, a Starfire 
family collar, a pair of white billowing leggings, a set of dunestalker leather
armour, a pair of leather vambraces, and a dark mask of stained cloth. He 
wields a jagged black sitara in his left hand.

Past the gates of the Academia Sylvalis. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
wrought-iron gates of the Academia are now no more than a twisted mass of 
jagged metal. Very little of the elegant silver leaves that once adorned the 
gate remain, having been looted in the past. The pathway leading towards the 
rotting oak front doors is potholed and littered with iron spearheads and 
burned papyrus scrolls. Near the corner of the building is an overturned 
wheelbarrow, its cargo of garden utensils scattered amongst the tall grass. The
entryway has been torn down, its intricately carved wood columns leaning 
against each other to form a tenuous archway. A scroll has been fixed carefully
to the twisted metal of the gates. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey 
wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth.

He is a lupine lycaean and is rather short for his race, standing at a mere 
five and a half feet tall. Dark brown fur covers his entire body, shaggy in 
texture. He's muscular, but lithe in movement and lean in structure, built more
for speed than strength, though wiry muscle can be seen beneath the fur and 
flesh, especially in his legs and forearms. Dark green eyes stare out from 
above an imposing muzzle with a wet black nose and ivory-white teeth, a large 
scar tracing the Lycaean's jawline the only thing marring his otherwise 
relatively (in a canine sense) handsome appearance. Lupine ears stand at the 
top of his head, and a short, shaggy tail dangles behind him as he walks. His 
stance is fluid, like water, and though he carries himself well he almost never
seems tense. He is wearing a subtle dark sitara wrist sheath, a pair of 
falcon-buckle boots, a dark wytch-hunter's trench coat, a flexible leather 
glove, a pouch woven from sea grass, a noble onyx ring, a soft black-fur cloak,
a worn headband of grimy leather, a woven belt of braided leather, an entwined 
platinum and gold engagement ring, a banded shield, an Ashtear family necklace,
a black forearm sheath, dark leather-strapped gloves, a golden Antioch signet 
ring, a handspun linen tunic, a pocketbelt, a snug leather thigh sheath, a 
leather helm, a pair of leather greaves, an ebon leather backpack, a Starfire 
family collar, a pair of white billowing leggings, a set of dunestalker leather
armour, and a pair of leather vambraces. He wields a jagged black sitara in his
left hand.

Overgrown herb garden. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. An 
overgrown garden lies in wait beyond the rotting wood doors of the Academia. 
With no caretakers available, the plant life within the walls has run rampant. 
Thick vines have overtaken the landscape, latching on to every available 
surface. A pond of stagnant green water lies off to the side, serving as a home
for even more strange plants. Two stately wooden columns have endured here, 
standing as sentinels near the entryway. Hardly recognizable for all the vines 
and plant life clinging to it, a third column rests on its side in the garden, 
having been overrun by it long ago. Once serving as markers in the garden, 
small decayed signs showing herb names are strewn about the vegetation. 
Cacophonies of cackling laughter fill the air swirling around a shrine honoring
Malkav. Standing approximately five feet tall, it flows methodically into the 
image of the masks of Comedy and Tragedy. A shimmering unicursal hexagram, 
spins ever slowly over the top. A half-destroyed statue lies in the center of 
the garden. A large lizard is here, sunning itself happily. Dias is here. He 
wields a Spellscourge sitara in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.

Overgrown herb garden. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. An 
overgrown garden lies in wait beyond the rotting wood doors of the Academia. 
With no caretakers available, the plant life within the walls has run rampant. 
Thick vines have overtaken the landscape, latching on to every available 
surface. A pond of stagnant green water lies off to the side, serving as a home
for even more strange plants. Two stately wooden columns have endured here, 
standing as sentinels near the entryway. Hardly recognizable for all the vines 
and plant life clinging to it, a third column rests on its side in the garden, 
having been overrun by it long ago. Once serving as markers in the garden, 
small decayed signs showing herb names are strewn about the vegetation. 
Cacophonies of cackling laughter fill the air swirling around a shrine honoring
Malkav. Standing approximately five feet tall, it flows methodically into the 
image of the masks of Comedy and Tragedy. A shimmering unicursal hexagram, 
spins ever slowly over the top. A half-destroyed statue lies in the center of 
the garden. A large lizard is here, sunning itself happily.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and down.

He is an armored akrabi and is quite the large man in a perspective view. 
Standing at the giant height of 6'8, this Akrabi stands out from his other 
counter-parts. With the skin as tough as chitin, but as normal as a Sidhes', 
this Akrabi is obviously a racial oddity. Topping over his head to flow down 
his shoulders is his long crimson red hair, that gleams like the blood dripping
from the body. His eyes, a deep violet, contradicting his hair color though, 
they pierce into the very essence of you, studying you intently, and patiently.
His tail swings slowly behind him looking to be around five feet long and to be
covered in the same type of chitin skin. He has broad shoulders that suit him 
for his type of work, but a lithe muscled body for his power as a Predator. 
Small lips grace the face of the half breed, rarely open to show his smile. His
nose, eagle shaped like a Tanaris', and his chin nice and smooth like a 
Norrjin, this Akrabi is obviously quite the mix. His abdomen showing from his 
leather armour, you can see the tan muscled skin and tell that this Akrabi was 
once of the desert, but is now a rogue of the shadows. He is wearing a black 
forearm sheath, a pair of paw-shaped boots, a buckskin pouch flecked with 
white, a dark black silk cloak, an elven bracer, a silk pack, a pair of 
silver-framed spectacles, a suit of wyvernhide armour, a pair of leather 
vambraces, a pair of leather greaves, a leather helm, a delicate rose engraved 
locket, a crystal teardrop earring, a dainty crystal anklet, a simple ring of 
silver, an enigmatic obsidian nose stud, a spiked silver choker, and a shining 
metal surcoat of Cruxis. He wields a Spellscourge sitara in his left hand and a
tower shield in his right.

Between two mounds of rubble.
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
twin pillars that used to rise majestically above the Caanae skyline have been 
reduced to crumbling ruins. Large pieces of the black and gold veined marble 
have been strewn across the road and flung off to the side, as though something
massive struck them with brutal force. The once-gleaming granite slabs that 
constituted the road are now scuffed and dulled by age and the elements. 
Growing in reckless abandon, wild grass is springing up around the fallen 
pillars, weaving its way between the stones to reach a decent height of about 
knee level on a human. Dias is here. He wields a Spellscourge sitara in his

Past the gates of the Academia Sylvalis. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The
wrought-iron gates of the Academia are now no more than a twisted mass of
jagged metal. Very little of the elegant silver leaves that once adorned the
gate remain, having been looted in the past. The pathway leading towards the
rotting oak front doors is potholed and littered with iron spearheads and
burned papyrus scrolls. Near the corner of the building is an overturned
wheelbarrow, its cargo of garden utensils scattered amongst the tall grass. The
entryway has been torn down, its intricately carved wood columns leaning
against each other to form a tenuous archway. A scroll has been fixed carefully
to the twisted metal of the gates.
You see exits leading east and west.

He is a lupine lycaean and is rather short for his race, standing at a mere
five and a half feet tall. Dark brown fur covers his entire body, shaggy in
texture. He's muscular, but lithe in movement and lean in structure, built more
for speed than strength, though wiry muscle can be seen beneath the fur and
flesh, especially in his legs and forearms. Dark green eyes stare out from
above an imposing muzzle with a wet black nose and ivory-white teeth, a large
scar tracing the Lycaean's jawline the only thing marring his otherwise
relatively (in a canine sense) handsome appearance. Lupine ears stand at the
top of his head, and a short, shaggy tail dangles behind him as he walks. His
stance is fluid, like water, and though he carries himself well he almost never
seems tense. He is wearing a subtle dark sitara wrist sheath, a pair of
falcon-buckle boots, a dark wytch-hunter's trench coat, a flexible leather
glove, a pouch woven from sea grass, a noble onyx ring, a soft black-fur cloak,
a worn headband of grimy leather, a woven belt of braided leather, an entwined
platinum and gold engagement ring, a banded shield, an Ashtear family necklace,
a black forearm sheath, dark leather-strapped gloves, a golden Antioch signet
ring, a handspun linen tunic, a pocketbelt, a snug leather thigh sheath, a
leather helm, a pair of leather greaves, an ebon leather backpack, a Starfire
family collar, a pair of white billowing leggings, a set of dunestalker leather
armour, a pair of leather vambraces, and a dark mask of stained cloth. He
wields a jagged black sitara in his left hand.

jagged metal. Very little of the elegant silver leaves that once adorned the

burned papyrus scrolls. Near the corner of the building is an overturned
wheelbarrow, its cargo of garden utensils scattered amongst the tall grass. The
entryway has been torn down, its intricately carved wood columns leaning

He is a lupine lycaean and is rather short for his race, standing at a mere
five and a half feet tall. Dark brown fur covers his entire body, shaggy in
texture. He's muscular, but lithe in movement and lean in structure, built more
for speed than strength, though wiry muscle can be seen beneath the fur and
flesh, especially in his legs and forearms. Dark green eyes stare out from
above an imposing muzzle with a wet black nose and ivory-white teeth, a large
scar tracing the Lycaean's jawline the only thing marring his otherwise
relatively (in a canine sense) handsome appearance. Lupine ears stand at the
top of his head, and a short, shaggy tail dangles behind him as he walks. His
stance is fluid, like water, and though he carries himself well he almost never
seems tense. He is wearing a subtle dark sitara wrist sheath, a pair of
falcon-buckle boots, a dark wytch-hunter's trench coat, a flexible leather
glove, a pouch woven from sea grass, a noble onyx ring, a soft black-fur cloak,
a worn headband of grimy leather, a woven belt of braided leather, an entwined
platinum and gold engagement ring, a banded shield, an Ashtear family necklace,
a black forearm sheath, dark leather-strapped gloves, a golden Antioch signet
ring, a handspun linen tunic, a pocketbelt, a snug leather thigh sheath, a
leather helm, a pair of leather greaves, an ebon leather backpack, a Starfire
family collar, a pair of white billowing leggings, a set of dunestalker leather
armour, and a pair of leather vambraces. He wields a jagged black sitara in his
left hand.

Overgrown herb garden. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. An
overgrown garden lies in wait beyond the rotting wood doors of the Academia.
With no caretakers available, the plant life within the walls has run rampant.
Thick vines have overtaken the landscape, latching on to every available
surface. A pond of stagnant green water lies off to the side, serving as a home
for even more strange plants. Two stately wooden columns have endured here,
standing as sentinels near the entryway. Hardly recognizable for all the vines
and plant life clinging to it, a third column rests on its side in the garden,
having been overrun by it long ago. Once serving as markers in the garden,
small decayed signs showing herb names are strewn about the vegetation.
Cacophonies of cackling laughter fill the air swirling around a shrine honoring
Malkav. Standing approximately five feet tall, it flows methodically into the
image of the masks of Comedy and Tragedy. A shimmering unicursal hexagram,
spins ever slowly over the top. A half-destroyed statue lies in the center of
the garden. A large lizard is here, sunning itself happily. Dias is here. He
wields a Spellscourge sitara in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and down.

He is an armored akrabi and is quite the large man in a perspective view.
Standing at the giant height of 6'8, this Akrabi stands out from his other
counter-parts. With the skin as tough as chitin, but as normal as a Sidhes',
this Akrabi is obviously a racial oddity. Topping over his head to flow down
his shoulders is his long crimson red hair, that gleams like the blood dripping
from the body. His eyes, a deep violet, contradicting his hair color though,
they pierce into the very essence of you, studying you intently, and patiently.
His tail swings slowly behind him looking to be around five feet long and to be
covered in the same type of chitin skin. He has broad shoulders that suit him
for his type of work, but a lithe muscled body for his power as a Predator.
Small lips grace the face of the half breed, rarely open to show his smile. His
nose, eagle shaped like a Tanaris', and his chin nice and smooth like a
Norrjin, this Akrabi is obviously quite the mix. His abdomen showing from his
leather armour, you can see the tan muscled skin and tell that this Akrabi was
once of the desert, but is now a rogue of the shadows. He is wearing a black
forearm sheath, a pair of paw-shaped boots, a buckskin pouch flecked with
white, a dark black silk cloak, an elven bracer, a silk pack, a pair of
silver-framed spectacles, a suit of wyvernhide armour, a pair of leather
vambraces, a pair of leather greaves, a leather helm, a delicate rose engraved
locket, a crystal teardrop earring, a dainty crystal anklet, a simple ring of
silver, an enigmatic obsidian nose stud, a spiked silver choker, and a shining
metal surcoat of Cruxis. He wields a Spellscourge sitara in his left hand and a
tower shield in his right.

chunks of marble from the once-grandiose statue litter the ruined street

Between two mounds of rubble.
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The
twin pillars that used to rise majestically above the Caanae skyline have been
reduced to crumbling ruins. Large pieces of the black and gold veined marble

massive struck them with brutal force. The once-gleaming granite slabs that
constituted the road are now scuffed and dulled by age and the elements.

once was a wall to show the inside of the bathhouse. On the other lies a
collapsed heap that may have once been a shop, shattered stones and fallen
pillars spilling off in all directions to mark where it once stood. Mahtar
