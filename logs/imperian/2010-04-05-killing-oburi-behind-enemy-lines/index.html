Imperial Parade nearing the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A sigil in the shape 
of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An elite Diavlous Knight is 
manning a cannon here. He has ninety-six cannon balls. Carefully watching 
everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. A fierce sabretooth tiger
prowls silently here. Smoky tendrils constantly twisting and weaving around a 
towering demon statue, a shadow servant is here. A kohdon scout stands here 
eyeing his surroundings with an impassionated stare. The mighty war gong of 
Stavenn looms here, hanging between two pillars of fused bone. The visage of a 
horrific demon carved in bloodstone rises up from a base of skulls and stone. 
Anointed with blood, a heinous demonic jackal crouches here baring gleaming 
teeth. A bubbling noise can be heard coming from the dark liquid of the 
fountain that has been placed here, as the occasional heart-shaped cherry bobs 
along the flowing fluid. A slow oozing of blood runs the length of this black 
cross. A fearsome lion prowls around here and greets you with a warning roar. A
crushed indigo nightfire butterfly is on the ground. A crushed white pearl 
butterfly is on the ground. Lord Oburi Nessaja is here. He is holding a tower 
shield in his left hand.
You see exits leading east, southeast, west, and northwest.

Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. There are 15 
elite elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. Waving ominously, a black flag bearing
stripes of indigo and gold rustles listlessly in the wind. An ancient and 
oversized tome stands upon a regally decorated pedestal here. The dead body of 
a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, black cross. 
There are 26 elite Diavlous Knights here. A carved stone bowl rests here, 
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. A massive groomed black
stallion stands here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. A
shaggy grey mustang roams warily nearby. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with 
the crest of the Empire ripples regally from the columns of the gates. A Kenuba
hippopotamus stands here, massive jaws agape. A short, stone basin rests upon a
pedestal here filled with blood. Carefully placed here is a glass frog 
figurine, tipping his top hat. An elite Diavlous Knight is manning a cannon 
here. He has 109 cannon balls. A captivating, wrought-iron display case sits 
here, decorated with an assortment of horseshoes, bone beads and feathers. A 
glass windchime has been hung here, the lily pads that hang from it constantly 
clanking together in a soothingly melodic manner. A large red and brown desert 
buffalo stands here, claws instead of hooves digging into the ground with 
tremendous force. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the room. Defiant in 
stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the surroundings with 
piercing eyes of ice blue. A fetid stench informs you that a colossal one-eyed 
hound is here. A pike with the decapitated head of Lyon has been erected. A 
pike with the decapitated head of Ephrenia has been erected. A pike with the 
decapitated head of Rudha has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of
Dias has been erected. A white hound stands here, tongue hanging out in a 
lopsided grin. The undead form of Lord Syric A'thenelle is here. He wields a 
tower shield in his left hand and a curved sabre in his right. The undead form 
of Mistress Abrianna Farrell is here. She is holding a tower shield in her
