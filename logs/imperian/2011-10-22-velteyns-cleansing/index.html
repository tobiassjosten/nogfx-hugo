"I
want you to look into my eyes and tell me why we are against magick, Velteyn." Ekitsu 
whispers as his crimson eyes stare deep into Velteyn&#39;s silvery blue eyes as if they could pierce through the mind and discover the darkest secrets.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Magick, and demonic arts, are 
corrupt, and the path to cooruption. As in my life I wished to find love, from my family mostly, Song said it best, Demoners are incapable of such things. I am against these things myself, because it is tainted and unclean, moreover, wicked, and evil."

Velteyn ponders the situation.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "I&#39; apologize for the way this is coming out, ive never actually thought of putting these feelings into words."

Ordikara Caius Kei&#39;daan says, "All the better."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "I was a wytchen guild secretary 
about 125 years ago... And i saw what it did then. the power, the fighting, 
the....wickedness that it spawned."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "I was reminded of that and more, in 
the moments i was there for the six months i was."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "They are nothing but a group of 
thugs hungry and lustful for more taint.. i find it disgusting."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "My grandmother, Song, snapped me out of the trance they had me under with promises of love."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "And i quickly left, but not before finding out what i already knew was true."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "I was once told, in my youth."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "That absolute power, corrupts 
absolutely."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Lord Lucian, my grandfather, was 
that man."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "And it is true. If we were meant to hold these disgusting arts... we wouldve had them before the moons split."

Caius stares implacably at Velteyn.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Allow me to explain."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "As i have been there, and felt its taint. Seeping from the walls."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "It is surely not a thing i feel 
comes from any Divine i want to be associated with, thus i believe it is not something anyone should actually hold."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "The choice to do such, seals 
someones fate, they are no longer.."

Velteyn ponders the situation.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Pure i guess is the simplest term.. 
but really, just no longer able to be associated with, while they hold such things."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Dont get me wrong, I believe in 
second chances."

Ordikara Caius Kei&#39;daan says, "That you stand here today, fair Antioch believes in second chances as well."

You nod your head.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "But a person has to want to change, without encouragement."

Velteyn nods his head.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "For that I am greatful."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "I have made my own mistakes, and I freely admit that."

Velteyn shakes his head sadly.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "You were not there."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "The wytchen guildhall.."

Ekitsu says to Velteyn, "I plan to visit it soon."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Is quite comparable to Dis."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "I will have to say one thing, 
however."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Being there for that short time, was
educational."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "The wytchen have formally allied with stavenn, I learned. and its members may be stavennite. I feel that makes them doubly enemies."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Is there anything else i might 
answer? I offer everything freely, without reservation."

Comprehension flashes across Velteyn&#39;s face.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "Oh, I would like to make one thing clear."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "The Ashtears that left, the ones in the wytchen, they are not my family, I do not count them as people or as kin,They separated themselves when leaving the desert and accepting taint."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "They are incapable of love, as Song has said, and thus, i am not obligated to give any."

Ordikara Caius Kei&#39;daan says, "It is a clear choice that has been made."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "There are things there i wish i 
could have never seen."

Velteyn gives a pained sigh.

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "But everything happens for a reason, eh?"

Ekitsu draws a smoldering-red sitara from a blood-red ceremonial sheath with his left
hand.

Ekitsu says to Velteyn, "I want you to kneel now, Velteyn... But before you do, please take a moment to think about your choice. I am going to cleanse you and call you my own brother. I will gladly give my life in order to save yours but if you stray from our path, I will punish you more than I punish the tainted. I will hate you more than I hate them for you have broken my trust and hurt me in a way that they are incapable of."

Velteyn kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.

Ekitsu lowers a smoldering-red sitara on Velteyn&#39;s shoulder as he says, 
"You are now on the Holy Path. As long as your soul remains clean, we are your brothers. You shall fear nothing as we will always accompany you, even through the cold waters of Cocytus."

(Abhaen): Caius says, "Welcome proper, Velteyn."

Ekitsu sheath a smoldering-red sitara into a blood-red ceremonial sheath with his left hand.

Ekitsu says to Velteyn, "Stand up and take your first steps on the Holy Path."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "I have to say... I expected you all to kill me."

Velteyn smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Ordikara Caius Kei&#39;daan says, "Luckily it did not come to that."

Indigo Angel Velteyn Ashtear, Star of the Sand says, "I won&#39;t dissapoint you, my 
brothers."'>Ekitsu grabs Velteyn by the chest and pulls him closer for inspection. "I
want you to look into my eyes and tell me why we are against magick, Velteyn." Ekitsu
whispers as his crimson eyes stare deep into Velteyn's silvery blue eyes as if they could pierce through the mind and discover the darkest secrets.
