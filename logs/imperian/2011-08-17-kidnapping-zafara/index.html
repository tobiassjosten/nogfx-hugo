Before a gate of the great desert city of Antioch. (road). (Shaahri desert.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A large
piece of sandstone inscribed with the word &#39;WARNING!&#39; juts upwards from the 
surrounding desert. Both fierce and protective, a massive statue of the Just 
Lord stands before the gates of Antioch, towering above the city walls. A lithe
desert fox slinks cunningly nearby. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey 
wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s 
Assistant is here. She wields a spiritual mace in her left hand.
You see exits leading north, northeast, southeast, northwest, and a set of 
ornately wrought, massive gates stand to the southwest (gate closed).

You flick your forked tongue out briefly, testing the air.

Zafara narrows her eyes and glances around.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I don&#39;t think you&#39;re who I think 
you are.."

You shake your head.

You have emoted: The whispered voice of a masked man murmurs, "But you will 
come with me either way, yes?"

Zafara backs away slightly and stops directly at the gates, unable to enter the
city.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I don&#39;t know."

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Why should I go with you? I don&#39;t
even know who you are."

You have emoted: A masked man paces slowly towards Zafara as he removes a rope 
from his cloak and forms a lasso.

Zafara smiles nervously, unable to see you in the surrounding area, the gates 
refusing to open for her.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I .. I think you have me mixed up
with someone else."

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I&#39;m Zafara. I&#39;m probably not who 
you think. I&#39;m just a priest.. no.. a Cleric of Antioch."

Zafara holds her mace in front of her sternly.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I am not afraid."

You have emoted: The whispered voice of a masked man murmurs, "No?"

You have emoted: In a split second, a masked man leaps on his wolf and begins 
to spin the lasso in the air before he throws it with precision at Zafara, who 
falls to the floor, screaming as she struggles to escape from the ropes.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant exclaims, "No!! Stop, someone. help me 
please!"

You see Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant yell, "No!! Stop, someone. help 
me please!!"

You see Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant yell, "Agghhh!!"

You have emoted: A masked man pulls the rope and ties it around his waist, 
ignoring Zafara&#39;s screams.

Zafara struggles hard, trying desperately to break out of the ropes, screaming 
and yelling for anyone around in the area to help, but her screams go 
completely unheard.

You see Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant yell, "Someone! I know you&#39;re 
out there, I need help!"

You have emoted: A masked man slithers close to Zafara and whispers in her ear,
"Nobody cares about you, Zafara. Do you see anyone here? No. You are my 
property now."

Tears fill Zafara&#39;s eyes and begin to slowly run down her face.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Nobody..?"

You have emoted: A masked man&#39;s tail wraps around Zafara as he murmurs close to
her ear, "Nobody, cleric. You are all mine."

You have emoted: "Cha!" a masked man murmurs as he leaps on his wolf.

Zafara follows you to the north.
A junction of Wendigo catwalk. (Ithaquan Council.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. This 
has been marked as holy ground. Arching up towards the sky, with a curtain of 
shifting light hung within it, the Lunar Pylon stands proudly here. A layout 
has been discarded here. A layout has been discarded here. There are a group of
762 charcoal cinders here. You have entered the campground of Aislygn. His 
muzzle grey and hoary with age, an elder of the village crouches here casting 
bones. Bundled in fur and leather, an Ithaquan village woman stands here 
silently. There are 2 Ithaquan villagers here. A spirited Shaahri stallion 
trots about. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large cream colored 
Graytrem draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. An elite Warden lancer 
is manning a cannon here. He has ninety-nine cannon balls. There are 2 elite 
Warden lancers here. There are 2 black wolves here. Silent as the grave, a 
massive armoured wolf sits here upon its haunches, ears swiveling at unheard 
sounds. A Kenuba hippopotamus stands here, massive jaws agape. An obese duck 
waddles precariously in a circle. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive
warhorse stands here imperially. A roan mustang is here, its long, full mane 
flowing freely in the wind. Its long, smooth tail curled around its legs, an 
exotic canine sits here peacefully. A vicious smoke-blue stallion stands here, 
pawing and stomping ferociously at the ground. A cloud of smoke fills the area,
coming from a campfire in the center of a campground. 
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.

You have emoted: A masked man tramples in on his wolf, dragging Zafara after 
him.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Where are we..?"

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I&#39;m still so.. disoriented .. who
are you?"

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "And what do you want with me..."

You have emoted: "Home." a masked man says as he leaps from his wolf and 
removes the ropes which were entangled around Zafara. "I am Pahm and you, you 
are my woman now." he says, helping Zafara to get on her feet.

You gaze intently upon Zafara, flickering your forked tongue inquisitively.

Zafara takes your hand and stands up, looking around nervously, wiping the dirt
and snow off herself.

A masked woman wraps her tail gently around Zafara, affectionately pulling her 
close.

Zafara narrows her eyes at you in an unnerving manner.

A masked woman sniffs Zafara, trying to decipher just what that smell emanating
from her is.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant exclaims, "Don&#39;t touch me!"

Zafara slaps you on the cheek.

A masked woman says to you, "She smells clean...."

A masked woman shudders violently.

Zafara glances around nervously, surrounded by unseen voices.

You have emoted: "Shut your mouth, woman!" a masked man murmurs as he raises 
his hand to strike Zafara but suddenly stops, controlling his anger.

Zafara gives a pained sigh.

A masked woman says to you, "This is the best you could do?"

A masked woman gives a trillingly melodic laugh.

A masked woman points an ivory sitara at Zafara.

Zafara holds her mace in front of her threateningly, stepping away from the 
masked man and swinging it around violently at all who might approach her.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant exclaims, "I&#39;ve had a lot of combat 
training, don&#39;t touch me, stay way from me!"

You have emoted: A masked man&#39;s tail caresses Zafara&#39;s face as he murmurs, "But
she is so pretty." The tail suddenly wraps itself around Zafara&#39;s legs and 
pulls them towards a masked man, causing her to fall.

Julianna releases the clasp on her mask, revealing herself.

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says to Zafara, "You&#39;re at the junction..."

Zafara swings her mace violently in response to his touching, missing 
completely and falling down off her feet from the tail sweeping.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant exclaims, "Shut up!"

Julianna Adresteia says, "Yes...combat training..."

Julianna Adresteia says, "Was that against a rat?"

Zafara narrows her eyes at Julianna in an unnerving manner.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I&#39;ll.. show you!"

Zafara makes an impassioned plea for truth to the Gods.

Julianna Adresteia says to you, "I suggest you make an honest woman out of 
her."

A spiritual mace clatters to the ground as Zafara&#39;s poorly-aimed throw misses 
you.

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Zafara, Sharatar would shoot me if I
didnt try to care for you."

The spiritual mace blinks out of existence.
Zafara bows her head in concentration and suddenly is holding her spiritual 
mace again.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Why is she not here?"

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Why didn&#39;t she come for me when I
cried for help?"

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Because she is antiochan."

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "This is the coldest place in 
Aetherius."

andering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Ironwood."

You have emoted: A masked man draws a shimmering sitara in his left hand and 
leaps onto Zafara, pressing the boneblade against her throat. "Relax or I will 
cut your throat. Just do as I say and you will survive through this."

Julianna swings her scaled tail back and forth contently.

Zafara struggles to release herself from his grasp, very carefully avoiding any
sudden movement to keep her neck from slicing on the blade.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Kill me, I&#39;m not scared of you."

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Let the poor girl go."

You flick your forked tongue out briefly, testing the air.

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "She is the Sister to an An&#39;sheri."

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "He&#39;s trying to kill me, and he 
dragged me here."

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "PAhm Stop."

A gentle hum arises from Zafara&#39;s seraph, as it raises a shield to protect her.

Calisto draws a hornbow and lets fly a broad-tipped arrow at you.
You are knocked unconscious from a broad-tipped arrow striking you in the head.

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Stop it."

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Yes, Pahm."

Julianna Adresteia says to you, "When you are done, we should speak."

You raze Zafara&#39;s translucent shield with an ivory sitara.

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Pahm I outrank you in this stop."

You narrow your eyes at Calisto in an unnerving manner.

A gentle hum arises from Zafara&#39;s seraph, as it raises a shield to protect her.

You give a pained sigh.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says to you, "You&#39;re a very strange 
person."

You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "And you belong to me 
now. Hand me all your gold."

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Next time il fill you with 
incediary."

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "You kidnap me, threaten me, try 
to hurt me, and then try to help me at the same time, but yet you are a secret 
admirer?"

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I don&#39;t belong to anyone."


You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "Really?"

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says to you, "She is not an enemy."

You have emoted: Pahm turns to Calisto and murmurs, "No. She is not. She is my 
woman."

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I&#39;m not an enemy, I was taken 
here against my will."

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says to you, "Cease it or I&#39;m getting the 
Feyn involved."

You utter a deep, rumbling laugh at Calisto.

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "She obviously doesn&#39;t share your 
view of being your woman."

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Feyn.. Ironwood.. Pines.. what&#39;s 
going on?"

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says to you, "Pahm.."

You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "I believe it is time to 
move to a private location."

Julianna wraps her tail gently around you, affectionately pulling you close.

Julianna whispers to you, "Perhaps this is not the place."

You gaze intently upon Calisto, flickering your forked tongue inquisitively.

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Pahm, there are better ways of 
winning her affection an you&#39;re not doing a very good job."


You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "Calisto, I will settle 
this with you in a moment."

An&#39;sheri Oracle Sharatar Eldunari Savann, Lion&#39;s Claw says, "Why was I pulled 
here?"

afara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Why should I trust him, or any of
you?"

Julianna swings her scaled tail back and forth contently.

Julianna Adresteia says, "Follow me, Zafara."

Jorzan says, "You can trust me. I&#39;ve got one of those trustworthy faces."

Jorzan gives himself an acknowledging nod.

You have emoted: Pahm draws a piece of rope and forms a lariat. In a split 
second, he leaps on his wolf and throws the lariat at Zafara, entrapping her 
once again.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Ugh.."

Panic overcomes you as Calisto draws back her bowstring and releases an arrow, 
a thin trail of smoke left by the burning fuse as it flys toward you.
Sparks catch your eye as an arrow cuts through the air, burying itself deep in 
your flesh. Noticing the fuse which burns upon it through the blinding pain, 
you are almost overcome with panic.

You manage to pull the buried arrowhead from your body with intense 
concentration of will and ignorance of the pain, extinguishing the fuse and 
tossing it away.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "Leave me alone!"

Julianna steps in and executes a quick slash across your torso, opening a 
ragged wound.
The attack rebounds back onto Julianna!
Julianna quickly flows into the Ein-Fasit stance.
Pain tears at your body as Julianna strikes you with a deep vertical slice.
The attack rebounds back onto Julianna!
Julianna quickly flows into the Vae-Sant stance.
Julianna steps in and executes a quick slash across your torso, opening a 
ragged wound.
The attack rebounds back onto Julianna!
Julianna quickly flows into the Ein-Fasit stance.

An&#39;sheri Oracle Sharatar Eldunari Savann, Lion&#39;s Claw says to you, "Let my 
sister go."

You roll your eyes at Calisto.

Sharatar stands with arms outstretched, her mouth moving rapidly in fervent 
prayer to the Goddess of Life.

(Ring): Julianna says, "Love this system."

Brilliant blue strands of light weave themselves together before Sharatar, and 
within seconds she holds a spiritual mace within her grasp.

You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "I will Ironcode you for 
this."

Julianna Adresteia says, "Let me take her Pahm."

A masked woman says, "What is the issue?"

Julianna Adresteia says, "You obviously need help."

Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "You have kidnapped someone here 
agains her will."

A masked woman snarls viciously.

An&#39;sheri Oracle Sharatar Eldunari Savann, Lion&#39;s Claw says, "Someone better 
explain why I was called here."

Julianna Adresteia says, "Isn&#39;t that what kidnapping is? Has someone been 
kidnapped not against their will?"

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "I&#39;ve been tied up, kidnapped and 
taken here by Pahm."

You have emoted: "Cha!" Pahm murmurs, as his wolf begins to pace around Zafara.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "He keeps attacking me and 
threatening me, and I have no clue where I am."

(Ring): Jazyra says, "Jesus wtf are you doing besides causing a bad scene :P."

(Ring): You say, "I&#39;m kidnapping a woman."

(Ring): You say, "What the fuck?"

(Ring): You say, "Did you check my surname? it&#39;s not Vuh&#39;uni."

(Ring): You say, "It&#39;s S&#39;Sylistha."

Balance Taken: 0.92s

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant asks, "Why should I trust you at all?"

You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "Because you haven&#39;t got 
another option."

You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "I am quite taken by your
looks and I want you as my woman. What I want, I get. Besides, nobody cared 
about you in Antioch."

You gaze intently upon Zafara, flickering your forked tongue inquisitively.

Wind whistles through the trees, making an eerie sound.

Zafara Eldunari, Physician&#39;s Assistant says, "... no.. my sister .. she cares 
about me."

You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "If that is true, I will 
allow her to visit you."

admirer."
Before a gate of the great desert city of Antioch. (road). (Shaahri desert.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A large
piece of sandstone inscribed with the word 'WARNING!' juts upwards from the
surrounding desert. Both fierce and protective, a massive statue of the Just
Lord stands before the gates of Antioch, towering above the city walls. A lithe
desert fox slinks cunningly nearby. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey
wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. The shining figure of a
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Zafara Eldunari, Physician's

exotic canine sits here peacefully. A vicious smoke-blue stallion stands here,
pawing and stomping ferociously at the ground. A cloud of smoke fills the area,
coming from a campfire in the center of a campground.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.
You have emoted: A masked man tramples in on his wolf, dragging Zafara after
him.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Where are we..?"
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "I'm still so.. disoriented .. who
are you?"
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "And what do you want with me..."
You have emoted: "Home." a masked man says as he leaps from his wolf and
removes the ropes which were entangled around Zafara. "I am Pahm and you, you
are my woman now." he says, helping Zafara to get on her feet.
You gaze intently upon Zafara, flickering your forked tongue inquisitively.
Zafara takes your hand and stands up, looking around nervously, wiping the dirt
and snow off herself.
A masked woman wraps her tail gently around Zafara, affectionately pulling her
close.
Zafara narrows her eyes at you in an unnerving manner.
A masked woman sniffs Zafara, trying to decipher just what that smell emanating
from her is.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant exclaims, "Don't touch me!"
Zafara slaps you on the cheek.
A masked woman says to you, "She smells clean...."
A masked woman shudders violently.
Zafara glances around nervously, surrounded by unseen voices.
You have emoted: "Shut your mouth, woman!" a masked man murmurs as he raises
his hand to strike Zafara but suddenly stops, controlling his anger.
Zafara gives a pained sigh.
A masked woman says to you, "This is the best you could do?"
A masked woman gives a trillingly melodic laugh.
A masked woman points an ivory sitara at Zafara.
Zafara holds her mace in front of her threateningly, stepping away from the
masked man and swinging it around violently at all who might approach her.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant exclaims, "I've had a lot of combat
training, don't touch me, stay way from me!"
You have emoted: A masked man's tail caresses Zafara's face as he murmurs, "But
she is so pretty." The tail suddenly wraps itself around Zafara's legs and
pulls them towards a masked man, causing her to fall.
Julianna releases the clasp on her mask, revealing herself.
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says to Zafara, "You're at the junction..."
Zafara swings her mace violently in response to his touching, missing
completely and falling down off her feet from the tail sweeping.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant exclaims, "Shut up!"
Julianna Adresteia says, "Yes...combat training..."
Julianna Adresteia says, "Was that against a rat?"
Zafara narrows her eyes at Julianna in an unnerving manner.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "I'll.. show you!"
Zafara makes an impassioned plea for truth to the Gods.
Julianna Adresteia says to you, "I suggest you make an honest woman out of
her."
A spiritual mace clatters to the ground as Zafara's poorly-aimed throw misses
you.
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Zafara, Sharatar would shoot me if I
didnt try to care for you."
The spiritual mace blinks out of existence.
Zafara bows her head in concentration and suddenly is holding her spiritual
mace again.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Why is she not here?"
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Why didn't she come for me when I
cried for help?"
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Because she is antiochan."
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "This is the coldest place in
Aetherius."
andering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Ironwood."
You have emoted: A masked man draws a shimmering sitara in his left hand and
leaps onto Zafara, pressing the boneblade against her throat. "Relax or I will
cut your throat. Just do as I say and you will survive through this."
Julianna swings her scaled tail back and forth contently.
Zafara struggles to release herself from his grasp, very carefully avoiding any
sudden movement to keep her neck from slicing on the blade.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Kill me, I'm not scared of you."
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Let the poor girl go."
You flick your forked tongue out briefly, testing the air.
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "She is the Sister to an An'sheri."
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "He's trying to kill me, and he
dragged me here."
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "PAhm Stop."
A gentle hum arises from Zafara's seraph, as it raises a shield to protect her.
Calisto draws a hornbow and lets fly a broad-tipped arrow at you.
You are knocked unconscious from a broad-tipped arrow striking you in the head.
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Stop it."
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Yes, Pahm."
Julianna Adresteia says to you, "When you are done, we should speak."
You raze Zafara's translucent shield with an ivory sitara.
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Pahm I outrank you in this stop."
You narrow your eyes at Calisto in an unnerving manner.
A gentle hum arises from Zafara's seraph, as it raises a shield to protect her.
You give a pained sigh.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says to you, "You're a very strange
person."
You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "And you belong to me
now. Hand me all your gold."
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Next time il fill you with
incediary."
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "You kidnap me, threaten me, try
to hurt me, and then try to help me at the same time, but yet you are a secret
admirer?"
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "I don't belong to anyone."
You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "Really?"
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says to you, "She is not an enemy."
You have emoted: Pahm turns to Calisto and murmurs, "No. She is not. She is my
woman."
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "I'm not an enemy, I was taken
here against my will."
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says to you, "Cease it or I'm getting the
Feyn involved."
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh at Calisto.
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "She obviously doesn't share your
view of being your woman."
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Feyn.. Ironwood.. Pines.. what's
going on?"
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says to you, "Pahm.."
You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "I believe it is time to
move to a private location."
Julianna wraps her tail gently around you, affectionately pulling you close.
Julianna whispers to you, "Perhaps this is not the place."
You gaze intently upon Calisto, flickering your forked tongue inquisitively.
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "Pahm, there are better ways of
winning her affection an you're not doing a very good job."
You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "Calisto, I will settle
this with you in a moment."
An'sheri Oracle Sharatar Eldunari Savann, Lion's Claw says, "Why was I pulled
here?"
afara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Why should I trust him, or any of
you?"
Julianna swings her scaled tail back and forth contently.
Julianna Adresteia says, "Follow me, Zafara."
Jorzan says, "You can trust me. I've got one of those trustworthy faces."
Jorzan gives himself an acknowledging nod.
You have emoted: Pahm draws a piece of rope and forms a lariat. In a split
second, he leaps on his wolf and throws the lariat at Zafara, entrapping her
once again.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Ugh.."
Panic overcomes you as Calisto draws back her bowstring and releases an arrow,
a thin trail of smoke left by the burning fuse as it flys toward you.
Sparks catch your eye as an arrow cuts through the air, burying itself deep in
your flesh. Noticing the fuse which burns upon it through the blinding pain,
you are almost overcome with panic.
You manage to pull the buried arrowhead from your body with intense
concentration of will and ignorance of the pain, extinguishing the fuse and
tossing it away.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Leave me alone!"
Julianna steps in and executes a quick slash across your torso, opening a
ragged wound.

An'sheri Oracle Sharatar Eldunari Savann, Lion's Claw says to you, "Let my
sister go."
You roll your eyes at Calisto.
Sharatar stands with arms outstretched, her mouth moving rapidly in fervent
prayer to the Goddess of Life.
(Ring): Julianna says, "Love this system."
Brilliant blue strands of light weave themselves together before Sharatar, and
within seconds she holds a spiritual mace within her grasp.
You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "I will Ironcode you for
this."
Julianna Adresteia says, "Let me take her Pahm."
A masked woman says, "What is the issue?"
Julianna Adresteia says, "You obviously need help."
Wandering Sister, Calisto Targaryen says, "You have kidnapped someone here
agains her will."
A masked woman snarls viciously.
An'sheri Oracle Sharatar Eldunari Savann, Lion's Claw says, "Someone better
explain why I was called here."
Julianna Adresteia says, "Isn't that what kidnapping is? Has someone been
kidnapped not against their will?"
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "I've been tied up, kidnapped and
taken here by Pahm."
You have emoted: "Cha!" Pahm murmurs, as his wolf begins to pace around Zafara.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "He keeps attacking me and
threatening me, and I have no clue where I am."
(Ring): Jazyra says, "Jesus wtf are you doing besides causing a bad scene :P."
(Ring): You say, "I'm kidnapping a woman."
(Ring): You say, "What the fuck?"
(Ring): You say, "Did you check my surname? it's not Vuh'uni."
(Ring): You say, "It's S'Sylistha."

another option."
You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "I am quite taken by your
looks and I want you as my woman. What I want, I get. Besides, nobody cared
about you in Antioch."
You gaze intently upon Zafara, flickering your forked tongue inquisitively.
Wind whistles through the trees, making an eerie sound.
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "... no.. my sister .. she cares
about me."
You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "If that is true, I will
allow her to visit you."
Zafara Eldunari, Physician's Assistant says, "Why do you have to tie me up?"

not run from me."
