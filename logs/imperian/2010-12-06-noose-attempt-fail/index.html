A tentacle shoots up from the ground, wraps itself around you, and drags you 
back to earth.
A junction of Wendigo catwalk.
This has been marked as holy ground. An icebox sits here. Arching up towards 
the sky, with a curtain of shifting light hung within it, the Lunar Pylon 
stands proudly here. Entrancingly placed in the room, someone has put a bread 
loaf shaped candle here. Lying on the ground is an oaken pipe. A fairly large 
group of charcoal cinders lies discarded here. You have entered the campground 
of Santhaea. The wise glance of a snow owl passes over you. Bundled in fur and 
leather, an Ithaquan village woman stands here silently. There are 2 Ithaquan 
villagers here. An elite young Warden sentry is manning a bolt thrower here. He
has eighty-eight bolts. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large cream
colored Graytrem draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. His muzzle grey 
and hoary with age, an elder of the village crouches here casting bones. 
Muscles rippling beneath black bone armour, a massive shire stands here poised 
and alert. A fierce sabretooth tiger prowls silently here. Absently shifting 
his weight, an owl of ghostly hues has perched here. There are 20 elite Warden 
lancers here. A powerful white she-wolf is lounging here, looking over her 
surroundings with a watchful eye. Carefully watching everything, a large, tan 
coloured tiger prowls here. Alitis, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the 
surroundings with a miasma of fear. A cloud of smoke fills the area, coming 
from a campfire in the center of a campground. 
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.
You are no longer alone with your victim; you withdraw into the treetops.
