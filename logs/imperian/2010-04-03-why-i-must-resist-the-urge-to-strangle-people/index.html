Dregaur used to love logging onto Stavenn once every three months to tell everyone how worthless they are. Once a person&rsquo;s IC infamy reaches a critical mass, they are allowed to say pretty much whatever they want. Whether Galt is one of those people is of course debatable, but this log seems to suggest he is.</p><p>Likewise, when a guild reaches a critical mass of reputed failure (deserved or undeserved), people can say pretty much anything they want about them without fear of consequence. Restoring a reputation as tarnished as that of the Bards is a very time consuming process. If the guild is well run and participating in the city, avoiding scandal and so forth, it will happen&mldr; but don&rsquo;t expect it to happen overnight and don&rsquo;t expect the opinions of older players to change&mldr;ever.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2afb5d3f943568db94ab188de21ad36c?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by ray.doraisamy@xxx on 04 Apr 2010</p><p>Jarrhn.

And my last ten deaths, at least, come from people jumping me in groups and/or killing me while I&rsquo;m hunting, fighting Chur and other people means I lose. And the reason why I&rsquo;m really mad is that if Galt should be calling any guild useless, in my opinion, it should be the Lorekeepers. The Bard&rsquo;s guild is one of the more active guilds in the city, and it&rsquo;s members don&rsquo;t shrink from their duty of defending the city. Even though most of them have transed nothing, they still go out and fight. I can&rsquo;t say that of the Lorekeepers guild leader, or of most of the Lorekeepers in general. The Lorekeeper&rsquo;s are the official guards of Kinsarmar yet when I asked the leader for help, he said he couldn&rsquo;t and was gone by the time the raid was over. I&rsquo;m tempted to take up the profession so we actually have someone to vortex since their is never anyone up when we need it. I don&rsquo;t even know why the Bard&rsquo;s have such a bad reputation beyond the fact that there used to be a bunch of people who simply did mudsex all the time. It hasn&rsquo;t been like that in a long, long, time&mldr;And what really annoys me with Galt is that he doesn&rsquo;t even do anything constructive. He doesn&rsquo;t say you are doing this or this wrong, he just says, you suck and sleeps&mldr;and stirs up trouble with Celidon. They already don&rsquo;t help us s because Kinsarmar screws them over every time they help and Galt&rsquo;s prejudice against them doesn&rsquo;t help. <em>sigh</em></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10837ba7dca9ea0fca6d0d390ab598ac?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by kuroi_ka_neko@xxx on 04 Apr 2010</p><p>I find it funny that you call the Lorekeepers useless, when 3/4 of Kinsarmar&rsquo;s most powerful combatants are currently Lorekeepers.</p><p>Also, cruellamenting Ahkan and getting Kinsarmar raided more often isn&rsquo;t really helping the city.

Ahkan raided the city at least six times before I cruel lamented him. And he was hoisting and killing people inside the city. So the whole, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be attacked if you didn&rsquo;t lament him,&rdquo; argument is a false one. I was told that Ahkan was going to be ready to talk peace before I lamented him but&mldr;is someone who hoists and kills four the day he was supposedly going to be ready to end the attacks really want peace?

Well, I have 1, hammer of forging. means I spend less comms trying to get the sabre that I need, that I would get anyway, but I just wanna do it cheaper. Ivellios is right about Doshar. Insinyan did the same thing. Kinsarmar was being raided, and he said he couldn&rsquo;t help. I think that if you&rsquo;re in the vanguard, and you do not come when asked, it should be city disfavor. If you&rsquo;re not from Kinsarmar, you should be ousted from the clan and enemied to Kinsarmar. it&rsquo;s bullshit. Ivellios and I are both tired of being the only ones ready to defend Kinsarmar when the time comes. I&rsquo;m half tempted to pay for about 5 or 6 characters lessons to get them started and get some decent combatants in them. And yes, bards to have a reputation of being lawlmudsecks, but with Ivellios Mathius, Xohln, et cetera, I&rsquo;ve seen a huge change in them. I&rsquo;ve been tempted to make a bard alt. Bard is a strong class to play. Ivellios, if you want RG profession, just say the word. You&rsquo;ll have it.

Not really. Let me break it down. Revelation ticks every eight seconds. When it ticks, you must hit with yoth, if you miss, you have to spend another eight seconds delaying and not dying before trying again. For people who eat juniper, then hyssop, it is even harder. And if you are getting vodun tickled, or grove knocking you off balance, it is very easy to miss the timing. Thespia songs&mldr;yes, once I do them, you have to wait them out but my god it&rsquo;s not like you can&rsquo;t prevent me from doing them. Break my arms, start with one, then I can&rsquo;t wield a second instrument so I will be unable to play bedazzlement which is the strongest of my offensive thespia songs. For a sketch, have a pet intimidate it away. It isn&rsquo;t that hard to figure out a winning stragety to beat a bard. You just have to do it. Trevize kicked my ass in a free for all with his use of Vodun tickle so I couldn&rsquo;t ever get my offense going. I&rsquo;m sure people can figure out ways for their profession to win, if you can&rsquo;t pull it off&mldr;<em>shrug</em></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed6448a92c7b99fef57c4ecd650ab11d?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by david.anez@xxx on 07 Apr 2010</p><p>Comparing bards to priests should had gave you a clue of my point.

Or, more accurately, every class in the game is overpowered, which is how they &ldquo;balance&rdquo; it. Bards get owned by some classes and own others. This statement may be accurately applied to every class in the game. You&rsquo;re whining because you think Bards are too powerful, but frankly, there&rsquo;s not a single class in the game that&rsquo;s too powerful, and thanks to classleads, they&rsquo;re all constantly being nerfed. If you choose to fight with the worst class you have in your repertoire, that&rsquo;s your prerogative, but in the meantime, don&rsquo;t take it out on everyone else because you make bad decisions.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed6448a92c7b99fef57c4ecd650ab11d?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by david.anez@xxx on 07 Apr 2010</p><p>Awesome how people can resort to say &lsquo;you just suck&rsquo; when they can&rsquo;t counter other&rsquo;s points.</p><p>My offer for bards to try it with a real class like runeguard is still open.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx on 07 Apr 2010</p><p>Fact is, bards have far less bad matchups then most.</p><p>Monk because they have kaido blind and deaf.

Of course, every single class out there I hear is good. I&rsquo;ve heard good and bad things about every class. When I took Laethus anti-magick, everyone told me Monk was easy. So I took it, mastered the profession, and found it to be the most difficult profession I&rsquo;ve ever fought in. I couldn&rsquo;t get around people&rsquo;s parry. It was to the point I was ready to get the lvl 3 str arti and the lvl 3 monk arti so I could jab punch people to death. Jab punches to straight damage without targeting a limb. So yeah, that&rsquo;s what I was going to have to do to get headway. I couldn&rsquo;t effectively fight summoners/hunters/outriders/druids because my fists couldn&rsquo;t hold a toxin. So I went predator, not knowing much about them, thinking they&rsquo;re a toxin class because they make them. I was wrong. Go ahead, laugh, I don&rsquo;t care, but the other 2 professions in the game that make toxins and are a toxin using class, so if you can&rsquo;t see why I thought that might be the case with the other one then you&rsquo;re just trolling anyway. So then I looked at a log of Zyran, saw that Wardancer was a good toxin class, and took it. I don&rsquo;t know it all that well, but I like it. Point being, every class has its pros and cons. Bard was good for its passive stuff, but I could be beaten by a Mage every time. I still to this day have never beaten a Mage. Even after they got nerfed. So we can all argue about which classes are &lsquo;real professions&rsquo; or we can accept that some professions are easier for some people and not others.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf6ba8df8dfcaaf54773e1311f830f6b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mbayliss1990@xxx on 07 Apr 2010</p>I can&rsquo;t find words to sum up the amount of -wut- I have for the,&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get past parry.&rdquo; &lt;&mdash;- as a monk, statement that you have put forth.
