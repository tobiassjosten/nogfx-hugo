Don't know who this is, killed me for no reason. Was reading help files on the 
website to try to get back into the game and came back to find myself dead for 
no reason.

nael wanted to phase before going through a Kinsarmarian towne. You can't phase
with a person in the room. She killed him to be able phase. Could she have 
asked him politely to leave, yes. Would that be in character for nael? No it 
would not. She has been driven partly mad from demon summoner and revels in the
blood of her enemies, she has no reason to be polite to anyone.">> Issue #102024   Reported by: Cian    Re: Nael
