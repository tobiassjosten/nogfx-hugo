Xylia smiles whimsically.

You say to Xylia, "I had a strange dream and I believe it has a meaning."

You purse your lips contemplatively.

Xylia says in an abnormally calm tone, "I&#39;m listenin&#39;."

A masked man also cants his head to listen, his features curious.

You say to Xylia, "First of all, before I describe the events which occurred in my dream, I would like to point out that it was very vivid and once I awoke, I was filled with regret..."

You give a pained sigh.

You say, "Why regret? you must be thinking..."

Xylia rests her elbows casually on the table and leans forward to listen.

You say, "I have never felt more alive than I did in my dream. Not even in reality. I had... a thirst for life."

You say, "I cannot explain it well."

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says, "Explain it as it comes ta ya."

You say, "I was floating on a raft, next to a friend. I do not know who that person was but somehow, I felt that his presence was warm and that I could trust him. I am not sure if I have met this person in reality."

Xylia slowly tilts her head to the side in observance.

You say, "And as we were floating away from the shores of this ocean that I have never seen or perhaps I cannot recall visiting such location, in the horizon, we sighted a brown mountain, as if it was made of mud or
earthenware... in the middle of the ocean."

Xylia looks about herself, rubbing her chin thoughtfully.

You say, "As we approached this strange mountain, we discovered strange caves which were inhabited by people. I wish I could say they were like me or you but no... They were the most peaceful type of people I have ever 
met. As we were approaching the caves, they waved and greeted us with sincere smiles. This group of people seemed to be unconcerned with our day to day struggles. It was as if everything was perfect in their life and their purpose was to reassure us, the outsiders, that everything can be perfect... That life is indeed beautiful and our struggle has ended as soon as we disembarked the raft and stepped into the cave."

You say, "We were surrounded by this peaceful energy, power... and it changed us as people. In my dream, I regained my trust for humanity. I stopped fearing that I might be disappointed if I show my softer side and I embraced everybody as if they were my brothers, sisters, cousins and so on."

A masked man says, "Uh, Xylia, have you any further need of me?"

Xylia blinks.

Xylia shakes her head at a masked man.

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says, "No&#39; now."

A masked man gives Xylia an acknowledging nod.

A masked man says, "A-all right."

You say, "We spent a few days among them, days in which we danced, we ate and we drank. They taught us their strange dance which had no choreography or preset movements and we also needed no music. We danced to the tempo of our hearts and moved as if nobody was watching us. We ate with them these strange indigo fish which were sweet and boneless and nobody was fishing them, they jumped into our caves as if they were gladly offering their life for our survival. We drank the best wine which did not leave us with a hangover. We 
weren&#39;t even drunk... Or perhaps we were..."

You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.

You say, "With happiness."

You say, "We communicated with these people better than we did with our family and the strangest thing of them all is that we used no words."

You say, "I am not sure how it happened but we communicated with thoughts, feelings and eye contact."

You say, "When the sun rays found a way into the caves, we remembered about our raft and decided to return to it to continue our journey. As we were embarking the raft, these people were waving at us and smiling just as they did when we came. Even though we weren&#39;t sure if we were going to see each other again, there were no good byes, no tears and no regrets. It was as if we finally were at one with the world and we understood the course of life so well that we had nothing to fear or regret."

You say, "As we were sailing away and this strange mountain was getting smaller and smaller, we were smiling and staring into the horizon... And then I had this feeling..."

You say, "I felt as if I was ready for everything and anything was possible. It was as if the world had no boundaries and I have just discovered the beginning of it. I felt no concern about the future and I embraced everything there was to come... I was at peace..."

You say, "And then I woke up."

You say, "And the peace was gone."

You shake your head sadly.

Xylia&#39;s mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says to you, "It sounds like ya need ta listen ta what yar spirit is tellin&#39; ya."

You say, "I don&#39;t know what my spirit is telling me."

Xylia&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says, "Yar spirit is tellin&#39; ya that thar beh no broundaries. Onleh tha ones ya set fer yarself. This is vereh true. Fear, is tha ultimate prison."

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says, "Ya found a home within this dream and peace."

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says, "Ya then decided ta leave. Ya were readeh ta leave with this new found knowledge. Tha&#39; person next ta ya was yar inner self."

You say, "Who were the cave dwellers?"

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says, "They were the embodiment of what ya wanted ta beh."

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says, "Peaceful, content, happeh."

You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.

Spirit Eyes, Xylia El&#39;Zaahir the Lykaina Alpha says, "Tell meh... what troubles have ya been facin&#39; now? Even tha slightest on goin&#39; anxieteh that ya can think of."

You say to Xylia, "Thank you. I have a few things I need to think about."

You say, "Thank you. You have been very helpful."'>Xylia pats a burly aspen log pedestal table in a friendly manner.
