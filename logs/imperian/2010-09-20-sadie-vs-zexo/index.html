A gaping hole is all that is left of the path, which seems to have suddenly 
collapsed here. It's quite clear that some sort of major natural event caused 
the collapse of an entire section of the arena. A faint path can be picked out 
amongst the rubble leading under the ground. Little plant life grows here; the 
rock and gravel prevents much from taking root. A rune circle has been sketched
into the ground here. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon 
you. Sir Zexo Bercalion, Knight Captain is riding on an armoured battle 
stallion. He wields a Souledge Sabre in his left hand and a tower shield in his
right.
You see exits leading north and down.

You move in towards Zexo for the backbreaker.
You lift Zexo triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised 
knee with back breaking force.
With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, Zexo's head lolls aimlessly far 
too far to one side. Zexo collapses into such an undignified sprawl that you 
realise that the throw did indeed snap the spine like a dry twig.
You have slain Zexo.">Abrupt end at a chasm. (road). (Northwest Arena.)
A gaping hole is all that is left of the path, which seems to have suddenly
collapsed here. It's quite clear that some sort of major natural event caused
the collapse of an entire section of the arena. A faint path can be picked out
amongst the rubble leading under the ground. Little plant life grows here; the
rock and gravel prevents much from taking root. A rune circle has been sketched
into the ground here. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon
you. Sir Zexo Bercalion, Knight Captain is riding on an armoured battle
stallion. He wields a Souledge Sabre in his left hand and a tower shield in his
right.
You see exits leading north and down.

You move in towards Zexo for the backbreaker.
You lift Zexo triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised
knee with back breaking force.

You move in towards Zexo for the backbreaker.
You lift Zexo triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised
knee with back breaking force.
With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, Zexo's head lolls aimlessly far
too far to one side. Zexo collapses into such an undignified sprawl that you
realise that the throw did indeed snap the spine like a dry twig.
You have slain Zexo.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3fd57273d1cd45f320a85ecd7ad20bec?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by falcon32252003@xxx on 21Â Sep 2010</p>Zexo needs to work on parrying more and putting parry back up, I didn&rsquo;t see him parry a single attack in the whole log.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
