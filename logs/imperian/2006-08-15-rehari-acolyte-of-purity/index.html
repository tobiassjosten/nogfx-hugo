With an almighty yell and a ripping sound to match, a thick, musty tome yields to Rehari&#39;s strength and gets torn in two by her mighty hands.

She is a stocky dwarf (etc)
  
With a look of accomplishment evident on her face, Rehari disposes of the 
remnants of a thick, musty tome in the provided rubbish bin.
    
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Bear witness and summon your friends."
  
Mortre says, "Was that it?"
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "See what pure strength is."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Anybody could rip a tome apart."
     
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Sarrius, "You would like to try?"
  
Mortre says, "That was it!?"
    
Rehari gives a thick, musty tome to Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm.
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I could set it on fire."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Rip it then."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "It&#39;s blank."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Sure, hell, why not."
  
(tome spam, he fails)

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "It seems the tome has proven you wrong, 
Sarrius."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Not a chance."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm exclaims, "Again!"
    
Performer Railos says, "What does that prove?"
    
Valafar Hlomaren says, "A cogent point."
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "It proves...she can rip thing."
     
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Apparently."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Maybe something smaller, like a deck of tart cards."
  
Performer Railos says, "I still don&#39;t get it."
  
Mortre says, "I was hoping for something a little more...interesting."
      
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Everyone may try."

Performer Railos says, "This is going to pointless.."

(tome spam)
  
You say, "Rely on no crutches...define "crutch", Dwarf."
  
Mortre says, "Wait, what did this have to do with abandoning magic?"
    
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Yes, bring in the Xiur, let the little dwarf show them strength."

(tome spam)
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "I believe you&#39;re either cheating, or we&#39;re just idiots."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "The strength of the dwarves is well known."
    
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "People use magick to increase their strength, though it only blinds them from the tuth."
    
Valafar Hlomaren says, "What&#39;s the point?"
    
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Far more useful to fill the tome with knowledge, than destroy it."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Fine, I will show you more."

Mortre says, "I think this is all some elaborate joke."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "There.. has to be.. a way.."

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Who here has the strength to lift this stone?"
    
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Do you think the propagandist allows his opponent to succeed?"
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Valafar, "A wise statement."
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I don&#39;t like these guys..propaganda...total loserness."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Why don&#39;t they just stand up for themselves."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I could yell about what I think all day."
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Dosen&#39;t make people think any better of me."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Surely, you may think that I have jinxed them in some way, but when you reject magicks there is no way to do so with ordinary items."
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Everyone...I think we should all give up magick right now and follow crazy here."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Nay, you have no need to "jinx" items when you make them yourself."

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Exactly."
   
Mortre says to Rehari, "You&#39;re a loony."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "It is a simple trick of craftsmanship to set them to fault just so."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Oh come on guys."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Lets follow the loony."
    
Performer Railos says to Rehari, "You&#39;re a dwarf!"
  
Performer Railos says, "You&#39;re naturally strong!"
    
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "There must be a rip in each of them.. somewhere.."
  
Onyn jumps onto Rehari, clinging desperately to her.
  
Rehari&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Believe my little dwarf woman."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "My strength is increased by my purity."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "She&#39;s an honest lass...as honest as a pervert in a whore house."
      
You say to Rehari, "I use no magick nor demons, lady Dwarf. Nor do I pray like a sycophant. So what do you consider "pure"?"
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "By your training, you mean."
  
Shyle Scrae&#39;Uden, High Oracle says to Rehari, "And what is pure?"
  
Mortre says, "Oh, puffy pantaloons, your purity."
  
Performer Railos says to you, "Joining Antioch, pretty much, I bet."
  
Master Varil Anar says, "I reject magick, have the strength of the Taekyon in my blood, yet cannot tear this tome."

You say to Railos, "Antioch is about as pure as Onyn&#39;s whorehouse over there."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Pure is yourself, without the crutch. Even Monks have crutches."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Varil, "I think she thinks your weak because you...are...taller than her?"
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "The faith of your guild is to serve the Divine is it not?"
  
Varil gives Rehari an acknowledging nod.  [Not really, Varil, you lose, sorry!]
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Thus a crutch."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "There is a fairly wide difference of definitions for people when it comes to crutch."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Rehari, "You say the divine are crutches?"
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Be glad you&#39;re graced."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "How... selfish, though not strictly in the pejorative sense."
  
Performer Railos says, "This was only an attempt to get us converted..?"
  
Rehari cries aloud her rejection of divine grace.
    
Valafar Hlomaren says to Railos, "What did you honestly think?"
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Oh, now it&#39;s going to get interesting."
    
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Not bad."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Who has the strength to pull this?"
  
You see Mortre yell, "Come one; come all! See the great loony battle!"
  
Rehari pats a weighted cart in a friendly manner.
  
Performer Railos says, "Kill me in a heartbeat.."
    
(Sarrius tries, can rock it a little)
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "I guess I can.. sort 
of."
  
Valafar Hlomaren smiles impishly and says, "It&#39;s only a half-ton."
  
Mortre says, "Go on, Rehari, amaze us with your purity."
    
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Ahh, the cynicism."
    
Shyle Scrae&#39;Uden, High Oracle says, "Do the pure have any other 
goals? Besides proselytizing, that is...you all seem rather adept at that."

(Rehari tries, succeeds of course) 
      
You say, "Indeed, "acolyte". Why do you not tell us what this "purity" is, besides leaving annoying little contraptions that shout their mildly silly propaganda?"
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "She taste yummy."
  
Mortre says, "So, is this going to become anything more than a spitting contest?"
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks, "Can we eat her?"
    
Valafar Hlomaren says to Onyn, "Down, boy."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I am showing you what you can do for yourselves without the aid of others."
    
You say, "A...huh."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Thats what I think about you&#39;re ideas, Rehari."
  
You notice a terrible smell in the air and see that Onyn is trying to look inconspicuous.
    
Mortre says, "So...you&#39;re teaching us your ways...by showing how much better you are...and not teaching anything."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Congratulations, you have proven that the crutches also affect your bowels."
  
You say, "And you are going to teach those of us who have no "crutches" your non-magickal parlor tricks for appearing stronger than a trained Hunter, then?"
  
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Go back to your mother&#39;s womb...or are you too pure for a family, evidently you&#39;re too pure for the gods."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Fine."

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I will show you the true strength."

Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Now, if you want to reject your creator go ahead, but I think I&#39;ll stick by him."
  
Mortre says, "Oh, good. Another display. Huzzah."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "A longsword, a weapon of your enemies can be easily broken."
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Break my curses."
  
You say, "Indeed. All you need is a hammer and a forge, or another sword and a body."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Break the magick flow of Aetherius."
  
Rehari&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "You&#39;re so pure and powerful."
    
Valafar Hlomaren says, "That&#39;s like saying break the moons - again."
  
Rehari begins to wield a shining longsword in her left hand.

A throwing axe comes speeding in from the southwest and strikes Rehari!
Rehari&#39;s body ceases to move as her body stiffens into paralysis.
    
 (axe spam while Rehari attempts to break said sword)
  
You see Rehari, Acolyte of Purity yell, "Make me a martyr."
  
Sarrius leaps forwards onto Rehari and mauls her viciously.

Rehari embraces herself with ardour.
  
Rehari has been slain by Sarrius.

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "How&#39;s that for strength, bitch?"

Overcome by death, Rehari&#39;s spirit fades to grey.
  
Mortre says, "Wait...the axes weren&#39;t part of it."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Now he catches on."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I have a doll of the pure one."
    
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm spins his axe by the handle, placing it in the loop of his belt swifty.

You say, "Ah, magick. Tainted, yet in this case even I find it amusing."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "I shall be offering the body to Father."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Excuse me."
  
Mortre says, "That was...rather amusing at the end."
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Good."
    
Mortre says, "Well...I think that turned me away from whatever she was preaching."
    
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Ah, well, back to life as usual for time being."

Valafar Hlomaren says, "At least until they try converting us again."
  
Mortre says, "I&#39;m amazed it took that long for someone to put her out of her misery."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "As if that were the end of her."
    
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "I was restraining myself."

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "But I grew angry."
  
You say, "She&#39;ll return, I am sure."
  
You say, "And will declare herself a martyr to her cause of false purity."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "How perfectly Wrathful of you."
    
Mortre says, "Oh...if we kill her enough, she might quit."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Wrath? Mmm."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "No."
    
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "The Fury of the Storm, 
perhaps."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "But not Wrathlike, I 
assure you."
  
You say, "Tempestuous, perhaps."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "If you insist."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Well, I&#39;ll leave you all back to your hunting, or whatever it was you were doing."
  
You say to Ailish, "You just missed it."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "Missed what?"
  
You say to Ailish, "We had a lovely young Dwarf here, she was performing parlor tricks and preaching of purity."
  
Mortre says, "The amazing display."

Ailish Eraudan says, "Oh?"
  
You say, "I&#39;m afraid we seem to be a tough crowd, from whichever walks of life we come, however. Sarrius decided to kill her."

        Rehari - Beneath the waterfall      (2 rms) - (multiple areas matched)

Varil, Cireb, Ailish, Kamaylie, Xanthus, Mortre, Sarrius, Nisha

Ailish Eraudan says, "Why should we listen to a dwarf?"

You say, "Oh, but Ailish, she&#39;s hilarious."

Mortre says, "She could pull a cart!"

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "She claims she&#39;s powerful and pure."

You say, "And rip a book in half!"

Mortre says, "And something with a sword!"

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "I got a little angry at the holier than thou attitude, so I put an axe in her skull."
  
Rehari&#39;s eyes sparkle with amusement.
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "A creature not even powerful enough to make its appearance not inciting of laughter."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Rehari, "Back for more?"
  
Lyargai arrives from the southwest.

Mortre says to Rehari, "Do another one!"
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Maybe, though a civil mouth would be appreciated."
    
Lyargai Thetiman says to Rehari, "Ah, there ye be lass, I dinnae know ye&#39;d thought tae be comin&#39; over here."

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Rehari, "My civility tends to leave when people act arrogant and call my lifestyle weak, in a matter of speaking."

Ailish Eraudan says to Rehari, "Perhaps they merely didn&#39;t appreciate being lectured to by a member of an inferior race."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I&#39;m simply displaying what one can achieve without relying on other powers."
  
Mortre says, "Yeah! Do the sword trick."

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Rehari, "Whose powers am I relying on, when I kill you?"
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "None but my own."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "Well, so far, the only thing I&#39;ve seen you achieve is die to Sarrius..."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I have spent years training to show people and to demonstrate."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "And if you are so powerful, how come you remain in this comic appearance?"
  
Mortre says, "My favorite trick was the one with the axes."
    
Lyargai Thetiman says, "Aye, an&#39; ye take pride in bein&#39; able tae slay an innocent Disciple?"
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "I mean, I am always open to new ideas, but so far, I&#39;m not overly impressed."

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Lyargai, "When she attempts to flaunt what little power she has and act arrogant about it? Yes."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "I take pride in killing fools like you and your fellows."

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Killing someone for a demonstration doesn&#39;t shine highly on your intellectual side, Sarrius."

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I offered you no harm."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Who needs intellect when I can kill people?"
  
Sarrius hums quietly to himself.

Lyargai Thetiman says to Ailish, "Tis, maybe, that we nae be Divine. Tisnae that we disrespect &#39;m, but we dunnae seek tae rely on&#39;t gods, fer reliance on aught that isnae yer own weakens ye."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "Speak common please."

Ailish Eraudan says, "I do not understand this dwarven gibberish."
  
Mortre says, "You&#39;d think that a pure one would have some sort of...protection."

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Why kill people when you can show them a better way?"
  
Lyargai Thetiman says to Sarrius, "Ah, ye dealin&#39; death be yer sole point o&#39; pride? Nae mind behind it then?"
  
Lyargai Thetiman says to Ailish, "I be speakin&#39; common, nae Dwarvish. Use ye ears, lassie."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Alright then, lets turn the tables. Why are your beliefs so much better?"
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Teach me."
 
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Because...we rock."
 
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "And?"
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Rehari, "I&#39;ll gladly teach you to throw an axe. Care to have your friend here act as a target?"
 
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Evidently one of us...was more than enough for you."
 
You say, "Because they are based on reality rather than parlor tricks and "teachings"?"
  
Mortre says, "And...we don&#39;t use parlor tricks to convert people."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "And horrible accents."
 
Valafar Hlomaren says, "So many holes."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "Don&#39;t forget the horrible accents."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Onyn, "I never stated that I study combat did I?"
   
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Lyargai, "Do you?"
 
Mortre says, "You never stated you could rip apart a book, but you did that."
 
Valafar Hlomaren says, "The simple fact of the matter is that, as I&#39;ve said to others, ideas are like shoes. We take what we need, and let the rest go hang."
 
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "So why is it that people assume that combat is so important? No, I don&#39;t, as you witnessed."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Our arts are stronger because they are more refined. They have flourished and they have a strength behind them. Be it study, be it practice, be it magick or the divine. But it quite obviously outclasses you and your teachings, I noticed."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says to Rehari, "I wonder that myself oftentimes."
    
Mortre says, "Why is ripping books apart so important? I&#39;m not going to defend myself by telling an orc to watch me rip a book apart!"

You say, "I trust the animals that come when I call because they trust me. I trust my axe because I throw it with strength. I trust my words because I speak reasonably and laugh at your idea of false purity and rejecting the Gods because I have seen my Lady heal an entire valley."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Rehari, "Maybe people throwing axes is too hard for you?"
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I can teach you though."
   
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I see that you miss the point. I have no care for combat, thus I don&#39;t bother to defend."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says to Rehari, "Admirable, if misplaced."
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "So when attacked, you just lay down and die?"
 
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks, "Can I have a better doll, 
then?"
  
Lyargai Thetiman says to you, "Ye nae listen, eh? We dunnae reject Gods. But we dunnae seek to beg em tae be usin&#39; their power, fer tis a crutch that prevents us from growin&#39;"    [IÃ¢â¬â¢d listen if youÃ¢â¬â¢d learned that accent roleplay not only sucks, but  a stereotypical KithÃ¢â¬â¢Vahni accent on a muamrite is retarded]
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "In a world like this, where I obviously just attacked you for striking a nerve with me, I think it is a wise choice to care about it."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I study personal strength. While someone who studies defense will likely not be able to do what I can because all my training goes towards muscle."       [Muscle that rips apart books?]
  
Rehari stands up from the ground.
   
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Muscle that can do nothing."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Because you have not disciplined it to achieve a goal."
  
Performer Railos says, "Sheesh...everyone&#39;s still here..."
  
Mortre says, "I&#39;d rather defend myself than be a loony."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Like the Taekyon have."
    
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "What you claim is pure also has no direction. No purpose. No place."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I have disciplined myself to achieve a goal."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "To achieve what goal? 
Become arrogant?"
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "Actually, as a reincarnation of purity myself, I&#39;m curious as to her ideas about purity."

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "And when that fails you, it achieves what, again? Nothing, so you die."
  
Rehari gives a thick, musty tome to Performer Cireb Murne.
  
You say to Lyargai, "So you are against those of Antioch, those of Stavenn, and those of other guilds that use magick. You are being hypocritical, then, to say that you do not reject the Gods but do not use the gifts They give."
 
Cireb studies a thick, musty tome before placing a hand on either side and 
attempts to rip it in half.
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Just because one doesn&#39;t use them doesn&#39;t mean that one has to go and attack those that do."
  
Sweat begins to form on Cireb&#39;s arms as he strains against the strength of a 
thick, musty tome.
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Rehari, "Had you refined your strength in to something powerful, something practiced and disciplined, you could have defended yourself against me."
 
Cireb groans in exertion as the edges of a thick, musty tome begin to tear.
 
Lyargai Thetiman says to you, "When ye beseech fer a miracle, tisnae a case of &#39;em givin&#39;. Tis a case of ye beggin&#39; fer it."
  
With an almighty yell and a ripping sound to match, a thick, musty tome yields 
to Cireb&#39;s strength and gets torn in two by his mighty hands.
  
Ailish Eraudan says to Cireb, "Let me help you."
 
Lyargai applauds Cireb wholeheartedly.
 
With a look of accomplishment evident on his face, Cireb disposes of the 
remnants of a thick, musty tome in the provided rubbish bin.
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Cireb, "Good work."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Sarrius, "If I cared to study it, yes."
  
Performer Cireb Murne says to Ailish, "I&#39;m perfectly fine without your help, but I thank you for the offer."
 
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Cireb, "Congratulations."
 
You say to Lyargai, "My Lady grants me a measure of Her strength because I am Her Voice. She offers these things freely for me to utilize when they are most needed."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Lyargai, "So, what do your people do for fighting...just punch the hell outa people, cause as far as I can tell...using a sword...would be using a tool, which you don&#39;t do."
 
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Lyargai, "Which meens that
the Taekyon should be ok in your book."

-    19  Cireb               No Guild       On

Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Tell me that."
  
Mortre says, "This got a little more interesting."
    
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "The Taekyon focus on pleasing the Gods, a pleased God grants rewards."   [UhÃ¢â¬Â¦which Taekyon are these?]
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "The Taekyon focus on no such thing."
 
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Oh my, they please the gods, how terrible of them."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Are you insane?"
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "She taste insane."
  
Mortre says, "I&#39;ve been calling her a loony for a while now; are you just 
catching on?"

You say, "Do you know, I am fairly certain that none of my family that has been in that particular guild have ever been terribly concerned with pleasing the Divine."
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "Nor have I, when I was one."
  
Someone powerful says to Onyn, "Ye know, if&#39;n ye have naught but boyish mockery, &#39;n insults wi&#39; naught behind &#39;em but the mind of a brick, might be best if ye dinnae speak."

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Though what was the guild founded on? Serving the Divine maybe?"
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "No."
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Contemplation and 
bodily discipline."

You say, "Perhaps you should take the cotton out of your mouth, Lyargai, you&#39;d 
speak more clearly."

Ailish Eraudan says, "You really ought to demonstrate some knowledge rather 
quickly. For you&#39;re crunchy and I&#39;m hungry."
    
Mortre says, "Let&#39;s eat her and absorb her purity!"

You say, "The Taekyon broke off from the Clerics and decided to perfect their own talents, rather than worshipping the Gods. Perhaps you should read a book, pure one."
 
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Come now, let us stay civil in conversation. Discussion is a good thing."
 
Valafar Hlomaren says, "How swiftly talk moves to violence."

Mortre says, "That&#39;s it. I grow weary of this."

Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Everyone...lets just do this, her way."
  
Lyargai Thetiman says to Rehari, "Eh, these&#39;n be windin&#39; each other up wi&#39; their clever remarks an&#39; violent tendancies. I&#39;ll be in&#39;t me workshop when ye get tired o&#39; tryin&#39; tae give em the gift o&#39; self-reliance."
  
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Rehari, "What is it that you want us to know?"
  
You say to Ailish, "They&#39;re a bit naive, don&#39;t you think?"
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "Stupid, more like it."
  
Sa&#39;Athien Garess Mahl&#39;Hanna says to you, "What are they on about?"
  
You say to Garess, ""purity"."
  
Valafar Hlomaren mutters, "I..... ideas everywhere, and h...ly a m..d to 
thi..."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "You could always ask me to leave."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "Or rather, without any coherent point."
  
Rehari shakes her head sadly.
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Or."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "I could.. you know.. 
kill you again."
 
Sarrius flashes Rehari a joyous smile.
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "I&#39;ve been here for a bit now, and I still have no idea what they&#39;re on about."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Not to be a jerk or anything."
    
Kamaylie Pyralis says, "There is no point in violence.."
    
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "You did that one, what would doing it again prove?"
 
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder&#39;s Shadow says, "When isn&#39;t there a point in violence?"
   
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Rehari, "That I&#39;m still stronger than you and your arts."
  
Sa&#39;Athien Garess Mahl&#39;Hanna says, "Sadly, I&#39;m going to have to go with the demonlover on this one."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "In my experience violence solves everything."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Point being, violence is an answer to every problem - just not necessarily the best one."

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "You still fail to listen."
 
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Because this kind of discussion has been going on for ever, Stavenn versus Antioch, Kinsarmar versus Antioch, Kinsarmar versus Stavenn, its all the same, they think each is evil and impure, what is it that makes you so ground shattering, why do you think that me or any of these people would react diffrently, I&#39;ve acted like an ass, but there it is, what is it that is so important about you, that makes you worth world attention."
 
Kamaylie Pyralis says, "Then sad experiences."
  
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder&#39;s Shadow says, "If not the best answer."
  
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder&#39;s Shadow says, "It&#39;s easily the most fun."
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "No. I listen. But I do 
not care."

Ailish Eraudan says, "I am listening, you&#39;re just not saying anything."
    
Ailish Eraudan says, "Don&#39;t kill her yet."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "I want her to make one coherent point."
   
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Ailish, "She has."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "Just one thing that actually makes sense."
  
Ailish Eraudan says, "Not while I was here!"
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Onyn, "I&#39;m not special. I&#39;m just here to show people that there is a different way to life."
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "If she can, I&#39;ll be so stunned she can flee with her life while I recover."
    
Onyn Scrae&#39;Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Ailish, "Then don&#39;t make her repeat herself, because you weren&#39;t here, we&#39;ve acted like fools long enough."  [Falling into the godplayer trapÃ¢â¬Â¦now!]
  
Mortre says, "You&#39;re all still here."
  
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "If I only show one person what they can achieve on their own then I have succeeded in my task."
  
Ailish Eraudan says to Onyn, "Quiet. I am not talking to you."
  
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Some people like the sounds of their own voices a bit 
much."

Mortre says to Rehari, "Do the axe trick again!"
 
Sarrius rubs some salve on his skin.
 
Sarrius says, "Yup."

Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder&#39;s Shadow says to Sarrius, "Do your axe trick!"
    
Ailish Eraudan says, "And what precisely do you mean, "on your own"?"
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Which one?"

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Oh.."
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "That one."
 
Sa&#39;Athien Garess Mahl&#39;Hanna says to Rehari, "Everything I&#39;ve ever achieved that was worth it, I&#39;ve achieved on my own. You have nothing to teach me."
 
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder&#39;s Shadow says, "The one where blood gets all over."
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Eh."
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "Are you implying that my actions are not my own?"
  
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Oh, THAT one."

(Sarrius drags Rehari SW and kills her again)

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm yells, "You mean that one?"
  
You say, "Apparently she&#39;s busy."
  whodead

Valafar Hlomaren says, "And everone fails again."

Valafar Hlomaren says, "So amusing."

Sa&#39;Athien Garess Mahl&#39;Hanna says, "Can I have the head?"
 
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder&#39;s Shadow says, "And I the heart?"
 
Ailish Eraudan says to Sarrius, "You know, I was talking to her."
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Ailish, "I was too. But I got bored."
 
Mortre says, "I want the liver!"

Valafar Hlomaren says, "Like it matters. He likes to kill."

(CG): Kabaal says, "Stop exhibiting free will already. Bow down to the predetermined plot."  [This comment was on CG, but I kept it because it was so appropriate.]

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "My attention span is similar to this coyote here."
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "Not that I particularly care."
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says, "Typically very tiny."
 
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder&#39;s Shadow says, "What&#39;s wrong with killing?"
 
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Farewell, chatterers."
 
Performer Cireb Murne says, "Violence apparently solves everything in the minds of the people of Aetherius.."
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "But I wanted to beat her with argument rather than with an axe."

Performer Cireb Murne says, "It&#39;s a pity that ti&#39;s come to that, honestly.."
 
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Cireb, "Why yes. It does!"
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "That I could have done myself a long time ago."
 
Sa&#39;Athien Garess Mahl&#39;Hanna says to Cireb, "Just about, aye."
 
You say to Ailish, "To make a long story short, my dear, Rehari wishes to show us how to rip books."
 
You say to Ailish, "In order to prove that such things mean one is "pure"."

Ailish Eraudan says, "Cireb, when your opinion is needed, it will be given to you."

Performer Cireb Murne says, "I&#39;ve been around long enough to remember when the realm wasn&#39;t just, "Your idea is wrong, you die." Even Antioch and Stavenn held meetings back when I was younger that didn&#39;t end in bloodshed.."

Ailish Eraudan says, "Someone of your age really ought to have learned a few things."
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "First of all, violence solves anything. It might not be the best solution, but it is a solution."

Performer Cireb Murne says, "Someone my age realizes how those that strive to cure things with violence are the same people that I end up getting trimmed when they turn into nice leafy little beings of wonder."

Ailish Eraudan says, "Finally, your comment about hedges and bushes is neither here nor there, and, in fact, is wildly inconsequential to any point of discussion at present."

(Cireb attempts the cart trick, succeeds)
 
You say to Sarrius, "Old friend, your friendly acolyte has left Dis."
 
Ailish Eraudan says, "Is that one of her parlor tricks?"

        Rehari - Aryana&#39;s Spring                (1) - ruins of Caanae.

You say, "Let&#39;s see what else she has to say."

Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Onyn, "Is there a place where we can convine in safety? There are a few people who have taken an interest."

Valafar Hlomaren says, "Define "safety"."

Valafar Hlomaren says, "Or rather, safe from whom?" 

Valafar Hlomaren says, "Your homicidal friend with the axes?"

Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer&#39;s Storm says to Rehari, "Come back to me when you have learned to fight."

Kamaylie Pyralis says to Rehari, "Depending of who you wish to bring with you, I do have an area."
 
Valafar Hlomaren says, "I could offer one as well, however it would restrict the guest list."
 
Ailish Eraudan says to Rehari, "So you preach rejecting Divine Gifts, yet you 
accept Divine Grace?"

Valafar Hlomaren says, "It&#39;s called "pragmatism."."

Ailish Eraudan says, "Your teachings appear to have some holes in it."'>You see the following people here:
Vespa, Varil, Sarrius, Rehari, Kamaylie, Onyn, Zayn, Railos, Mortre, Nisha,
With an almighty yell and a ripping sound to match, a thick, musty tome yields to Rehari's strength and gets torn in two by her mighty hands.
She is a stocky dwarf (etc)
With a look of accomplishment evident on her face, Rehari disposes of the
remnants of a thick, musty tome in the provided rubbish bin.
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Bear witness and summon your friends."
Mortre says, "Was that it?"
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "See what pure strength is."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Anybody could rip a tome apart."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Sarrius, "You would like to try?"
Mortre says, "That was it!?"
Rehari gives a thick, musty tome to Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm.
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I could set it on fire."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Rip it then."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "It's blank."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Sure, hell, why not."
(tome spam, he fails)
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "It seems the tome has proven you wrong,
Sarrius."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Not a chance."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm exclaims, "Again!"
Performer Railos says, "What does that prove?"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "A cogent point."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "It proves...she can rip thing."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Apparently."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Maybe something smaller, like a deck of tart cards."
Performer Railos says, "I still don't get it."
Mortre says, "I was hoping for something a little more...interesting."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Everyone may try."
Performer Railos says, "This is going to pointless.."
(tome spam)
You say, "Rely on no crutches...define "crutch", Dwarf."
Mortre says, "Wait, what did this have to do with abandoning magic?"
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Yes, bring in the Xiur, let the little dwarf show them strength."
(tome spam)
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "I believe you're either cheating, or we're just idiots."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "The strength of the dwarves is well known."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "People use magick to increase their strength, though it only blinds them from the tuth."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "What's the point?"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Far more useful to fill the tome with knowledge, than destroy it."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Fine, I will show you more."
Mortre says, "I think this is all some elaborate joke."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "There.. has to be.. a way.."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Who here has the strength to lift this stone?"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Do you think the propagandist allows his opponent to succeed?"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Valafar, "A wise statement."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I don't like these guys..propaganda...total loserness."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Why don't they just stand up for themselves."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I could yell about what I think all day."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Dosen't make people think any better of me."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Surely, you may think that I have jinxed them in some way, but when you reject magicks there is no way to do so with ordinary items."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Everyone...I think we should all give up magick right now and follow crazy here."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Nay, you have no need to "jinx" items when you make them yourself."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Exactly."
Mortre says to Rehari, "You're a loony."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "It is a simple trick of craftsmanship to set them to fault just so."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Oh come on guys."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Lets follow the loony."
Performer Railos says to Rehari, "You're a dwarf!"
Performer Railos says, "You're naturally strong!"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "There must be a rip in each of them.. somewhere.."
Onyn jumps onto Rehari, clinging desperately to her.
Rehari's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Believe my little dwarf woman."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "My strength is increased by my purity."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "She's an honest lass...as honest as a pervert in a whore house."
You say to Rehari, "I use no magick nor demons, lady Dwarf. Nor do I pray like a sycophant. So what do you consider "pure"?"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "By your training, you mean."
Shyle Scrae'Uden, High Oracle says to Rehari, "And what is pure?"
Mortre says, "Oh, puffy pantaloons, your purity."
Performer Railos says to you, "Joining Antioch, pretty much, I bet."
Master Varil Anar says, "I reject magick, have the strength of the Taekyon in my blood, yet cannot tear this tome."
You say to Railos, "Antioch is about as pure as Onyn's whorehouse over there."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Pure is yourself, without the crutch. Even Monks have crutches."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Varil, "I think she thinks your weak because you...are...taller than her?"
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "The faith of your guild is to serve the Divine is it not?"
Varil gives Rehari an acknowledging nod. [Not really, Varil, you lose, sorry!]
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Thus a crutch."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "There is a fairly wide difference of definitions for people when it comes to crutch."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Rehari, "You say the divine are crutches?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Be glad you're graced."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "How... selfish, though not strictly in the pejorative sense."
Performer Railos says, "This was only an attempt to get us converted..?"
Rehari cries aloud her rejection of divine grace.
Valafar Hlomaren says to Railos, "What did you honestly think?"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Oh, now it's going to get interesting."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Not bad."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Who has the strength to pull this?"
You see Mortre yell, "Come one; come all! See the great loony battle!"
Rehari pats a weighted cart in a friendly manner.
Performer Railos says, "Kill me in a heartbeat.."
(Sarrius tries, can rock it a little)
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "I guess I can.. sort
of."
Valafar Hlomaren smiles impishly and says, "It's only a half-ton."
Mortre says, "Go on, Rehari, amaze us with your purity."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Ahh, the cynicism."
Shyle Scrae'Uden, High Oracle says, "Do the pure have any other
goals? Besides proselytizing, that is...you all seem rather adept at that."
(Rehari tries, succeeds of course)
You say, "Indeed, "acolyte". Why do you not tell us what this "purity" is, besides leaving annoying little contraptions that shout their mildly silly propaganda?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "She taste yummy."
Mortre says, "So, is this going to become anything more than a spitting contest?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks, "Can we eat her?"
Valafar Hlomaren says to Onyn, "Down, boy."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I am showing you what you can do for yourselves without the aid of others."
You say, "A...huh."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Thats what I think about you're ideas, Rehari."
You notice a terrible smell in the air and see that Onyn is trying to look inconspicuous.
Mortre says, "So...you're teaching us your ways...by showing how much better you are...and not teaching anything."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Congratulations, you have proven that the crutches also affect your bowels."
You say, "And you are going to teach those of us who have no "crutches" your non-magickal parlor tricks for appearing stronger than a trained Hunter, then?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Go back to your mother's womb...or are you too pure for a family, evidently you're too pure for the gods."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Fine."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I will show you the true strength."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Now, if you want to reject your creator go ahead, but I think I'll stick by him."
Mortre says, "Oh, good. Another display. Huzzah."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "A longsword, a weapon of your enemies can be easily broken."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Break my curses."
You say, "Indeed. All you need is a hammer and a forge, or another sword and a body."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Break the magick flow of Aetherius."
Rehari's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "You're so pure and powerful."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "That's like saying break the moons - again."
Rehari begins to wield a shining longsword in her left hand.
A throwing axe comes speeding in from the southwest and strikes Rehari!
Rehari's body ceases to move as her body stiffens into paralysis.
(axe spam while Rehari attempts to break said sword)
You see Rehari, Acolyte of Purity yell, "Make me a martyr."
Sarrius leaps forwards onto Rehari and mauls her viciously.
Rehari embraces herself with ardour.
Rehari has been slain by Sarrius.
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "How's that for strength, bitch?"
Overcome by death, Rehari's spirit fades to grey.
Mortre says, "Wait...the axes weren't part of it."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Now he catches on."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I have a doll of the pure one."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm spins his axe by the handle, placing it in the loop of his belt swifty.
You say, "Ah, magick. Tainted, yet in this case even I find it amusing."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "I shall be offering the body to Father."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Excuse me."
Mortre says, "That was...rather amusing at the end."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Good."
Mortre says, "Well...I think that turned me away from whatever she was preaching."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Ah, well, back to life as usual for time being."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "At least until they try converting us again."
Mortre says, "I'm amazed it took that long for someone to put her out of her misery."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "As if that were the end of her."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "I was restraining myself."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "But I grew angry."
You say, "She'll return, I am sure."
You say, "And will declare herself a martyr to her cause of false purity."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "How perfectly Wrathful of you."
Mortre says, "Oh...if we kill her enough, she might quit."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Wrath? Mmm."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "No."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "The Fury of the Storm,
perhaps."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "But not Wrathlike, I
assure you."
You say, "Tempestuous, perhaps."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "If you insist."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Well, I'll leave you all back to your hunting, or whatever it was you were doing."
You say to Ailish, "You just missed it."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Missed what?"
You say to Ailish, "We had a lovely young Dwarf here, she was performing parlor tricks and preaching of purity."
Mortre says, "The amazing display."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Oh?"
You say, "I'm afraid we seem to be a tough crowd, from whichever walks of life we come, however. Sarrius decided to kill her."
Rehari - Beneath the waterfall (2 rms) - (multiple areas matched)
Varil, Cireb, Ailish, Kamaylie, Xanthus, Mortre, Sarrius, Nisha
Ailish Eraudan says, "Why should we listen to a dwarf?"
You say, "Oh, but Ailish, she's hilarious."
Mortre says, "She could pull a cart!"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "She claims she's powerful and pure."
You say, "And rip a book in half!"
Mortre says, "And something with a sword!"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "I got a little angry at the holier than thou attitude, so I put an axe in her skull."
Rehari's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Ailish Eraudan says, "A creature not even powerful enough to make its appearance not inciting of laughter."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Rehari, "Back for more?"
Lyargai arrives from the southwest.
Mortre says to Rehari, "Do another one!"
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Maybe, though a civil mouth would be appreciated."
Lyargai Thetiman says to Rehari, "Ah, there ye be lass, I dinnae know ye'd thought tae be comin' over here."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Rehari, "My civility tends to leave when people act arrogant and call my lifestyle weak, in a matter of speaking."
Ailish Eraudan says to Rehari, "Perhaps they merely didn't appreciate being lectured to by a member of an inferior race."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I'm simply displaying what one can achieve without relying on other powers."
Mortre says, "Yeah! Do the sword trick."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Rehari, "Whose powers am I relying on, when I kill you?"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "None but my own."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Well, so far, the only thing I've seen you achieve is die to Sarrius..."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I have spent years training to show people and to demonstrate."
Ailish Eraudan says, "And if you are so powerful, how come you remain in this comic appearance?"
Mortre says, "My favorite trick was the one with the axes."
Lyargai Thetiman says, "Aye, an' ye take pride in bein' able tae slay an innocent Disciple?"
Ailish Eraudan says, "I mean, I am always open to new ideas, but so far, I'm not overly impressed."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Lyargai, "When she attempts to flaunt what little power she has and act arrogant about it? Yes."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "I take pride in killing fools like you and your fellows."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Killing someone for a demonstration doesn't shine highly on your intellectual side, Sarrius."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I offered you no harm."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Who needs intellect when I can kill people?"
Sarrius hums quietly to himself.
Lyargai Thetiman says to Ailish, "Tis, maybe, that we nae be Divine. Tisnae that we disrespect 'm, but we dunnae seek tae rely on't gods, fer reliance on aught that isnae yer own weakens ye."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Speak common please."
Ailish Eraudan says, "I do not understand this dwarven gibberish."
Mortre says, "You'd think that a pure one would have some sort of...protection."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Why kill people when you can show them a better way?"
Lyargai Thetiman says to Sarrius, "Ah, ye dealin' death be yer sole point o' pride? Nae mind behind it then?"
Lyargai Thetiman says to Ailish, "I be speakin' common, nae Dwarvish. Use ye ears, lassie."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Alright then, lets turn the tables. Why are your beliefs so much better?"
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Teach me."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Because...we rock."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "And?"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Rehari, "I'll gladly teach you to throw an axe. Care to have your friend here act as a target?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Evidently one of us...was more than enough for you."
You say, "Because they are based on reality rather than parlor tricks and "teachings"?"
Mortre says, "And...we don't use parlor tricks to convert people."
Ailish Eraudan says, "And horrible accents."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "So many holes."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Don't forget the horrible accents."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Onyn, "I never stated that I study combat did I?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Lyargai, "Do you?"
Mortre says, "You never stated you could rip apart a book, but you did that."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "The simple fact of the matter is that, as I've said to others, ideas are like shoes. We take what we need, and let the rest go hang."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "So why is it that people assume that combat is so important? No, I don't, as you witnessed."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Our arts are stronger because they are more refined. They have flourished and they have a strength behind them. Be it study, be it practice, be it magick or the divine. But it quite obviously outclasses you and your teachings, I noticed."
Valafar Hlomaren says to Rehari, "I wonder that myself oftentimes."
Mortre says, "Why is ripping books apart so important? I'm not going to defend myself by telling an orc to watch me rip a book apart!"
You say, "I trust the animals that come when I call because they trust me. I trust my axe because I throw it with strength. I trust my words because I speak reasonably and laugh at your idea of false purity and rejecting the Gods because I have seen my Lady heal an entire valley."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Rehari, "Maybe people throwing axes is too hard for you?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "I can teach you though."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I see that you miss the point. I have no care for combat, thus I don't bother to defend."
Valafar Hlomaren says to Rehari, "Admirable, if misplaced."
Ailish Eraudan says, "So when attacked, you just lay down and die?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks, "Can I have a better doll,
then?"
Lyargai Thetiman says to you, "Ye nae listen, eh? We dunnae reject Gods. But we dunnae seek to beg em tae be usin' their power, fer tis a crutch that prevents us from growin'" [IÃ¢â¬â¢d listen if youÃ¢â¬â¢d learned that accent roleplay not only sucks, but a stereotypical KithÃ¢â¬â¢Vahni accent on a muamrite is retarded]
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "In a world like this, where I obviously just attacked you for striking a nerve with me, I think it is a wise choice to care about it."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I study personal strength. While someone who studies defense will likely not be able to do what I can because all my training goes towards muscle." [Muscle that rips apart books?]
Rehari stands up from the ground.
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Muscle that can do nothing."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Because you have not disciplined it to achieve a goal."
Performer Railos says, "Sheesh...everyone's still here..."
Mortre says, "I'd rather defend myself than be a loony."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Like the Taekyon have."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "What you claim is pure also has no direction. No purpose. No place."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "I have disciplined myself to achieve a goal."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "To achieve what goal?
Become arrogant?"
Ailish Eraudan says, "Actually, as a reincarnation of purity myself, I'm curious as to her ideas about purity."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "And when that fails you, it achieves what, again? Nothing, so you die."
Rehari gives a thick, musty tome to Performer Cireb Murne.
You say to Lyargai, "So you are against those of Antioch, those of Stavenn, and those of other guilds that use magick. You are being hypocritical, then, to say that you do not reject the Gods but do not use the gifts They give."
Cireb studies a thick, musty tome before placing a hand on either side and
attempts to rip it in half.
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Just because one doesn't use them doesn't mean that one has to go and attack those that do."
Sweat begins to form on Cireb's arms as he strains against the strength of a
thick, musty tome.
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Rehari, "Had you refined your strength in to something powerful, something practiced and disciplined, you could have defended yourself against me."
Cireb groans in exertion as the edges of a thick, musty tome begin to tear.
Lyargai Thetiman says to you, "When ye beseech fer a miracle, tisnae a case of 'em givin'. Tis a case of ye beggin' fer it."
With an almighty yell and a ripping sound to match, a thick, musty tome yields
to Cireb's strength and gets torn in two by his mighty hands.
Ailish Eraudan says to Cireb, "Let me help you."
Lyargai applauds Cireb wholeheartedly.
With a look of accomplishment evident on his face, Cireb disposes of the
remnants of a thick, musty tome in the provided rubbish bin.
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Cireb, "Good work."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Sarrius, "If I cared to study it, yes."
Performer Cireb Murne says to Ailish, "I'm perfectly fine without your help, but I thank you for the offer."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Cireb, "Congratulations."
You say to Lyargai, "My Lady grants me a measure of Her strength because I am Her Voice. She offers these things freely for me to utilize when they are most needed."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Lyargai, "So, what do your people do for fighting...just punch the hell outa people, cause as far as I can tell...using a sword...would be using a tool, which you don't do."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Lyargai, "Which meens that
the Taekyon should be ok in your book."
***********************[ Newbie Who ]***********************
(newbies, plus!:)
- 19 Cireb No Guild On
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Tell me that."
Mortre says, "This got a little more interesting."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "The Taekyon focus on pleasing the Gods, a pleased God grants rewards." [UhÃ¢â¬Â¦which Taekyon are these?]
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "The Taekyon focus on no such thing."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Oh my, they please the gods, how terrible of them."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Are you insane?"
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "She taste insane."
Mortre says, "I've been calling her a loony for a while now; are you just
catching on?"
You say, "Do you know, I am fairly certain that none of my family that has been in that particular guild have ever been terribly concerned with pleasing the Divine."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Nor have I, when I was one."
Someone powerful says to Onyn, "Ye know, if'n ye have naught but boyish mockery, 'n insults wi' naught behind 'em but the mind of a brick, might be best if ye dinnae speak."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Though what was the guild founded on? Serving the Divine maybe?"
Ailish Eraudan says, "No."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Contemplation and
bodily discipline."
You say, "Perhaps you should take the cotton out of your mouth, Lyargai, you'd
speak more clearly."
Ailish Eraudan says, "You really ought to demonstrate some knowledge rather
quickly. For you're crunchy and I'm hungry."
Mortre says, "Let's eat her and absorb her purity!"
You say, "The Taekyon broke off from the Clerics and decided to perfect their own talents, rather than worshipping the Gods. Perhaps you should read a book, pure one."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "Come now, let us stay civil in conversation. Discussion is a good thing."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "How swiftly talk moves to violence."
Mortre says, "That's it. I grow weary of this."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says, "Everyone...lets just do this, her way."
Lyargai Thetiman says to Rehari, "Eh, these'n be windin' each other up wi' their clever remarks an' violent tendancies. I'll be in't me workshop when ye get tired o' tryin' tae give em the gift o' self-reliance."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits asks Rehari, "What is it that you want us to know?"
You say to Ailish, "They're a bit naive, don't you think?"
Ailish Eraudan says, "Stupid, more like it."
Sa'Athien Garess Mahl'Hanna says to you, "What are they on about?"
You say to Garess, ""purity"."
Valafar Hlomaren mutters, "I..... ideas everywhere, and h...ly a m..d to
thi..."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "You could always ask me to leave."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Or rather, without any coherent point."
Rehari shakes her head sadly.
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Or."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "I could.. you know..
kill you again."
Sarrius flashes Rehari a joyous smile.
Ailish Eraudan says, "I've been here for a bit now, and I still have no idea what they're on about."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Not to be a jerk or anything."
Kamaylie Pyralis says, "There is no point in violence.."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "You did that one, what would doing it again prove?"
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder's Shadow says, "When isn't there a point in violence?"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Rehari, "That I'm still stronger than you and your arts."
Sa'Athien Garess Mahl'Hanna says, "Sadly, I'm going to have to go with the demonlover on this one."
Ailish Eraudan says, "In my experience violence solves everything."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Point being, violence is an answer to every problem - just not necessarily the best one."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "You still fail to listen."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Rehari, "Because this kind of discussion has been going on for ever, Stavenn versus Antioch, Kinsarmar versus Antioch, Kinsarmar versus Stavenn, its all the same, they think each is evil and impure, what is it that makes you so ground shattering, why do you think that me or any of these people would react diffrently, I've acted like an ass, but there it is, what is it that is so important about you, that makes you worth world attention."
Kamaylie Pyralis says, "Then sad experiences."
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder's Shadow says, "If not the best answer."
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder's Shadow says, "It's easily the most fun."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "No. I listen. But I do
not care."
Ailish Eraudan says, "I am listening, you're just not saying anything."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Don't kill her yet."
Ailish Eraudan says, "I want her to make one coherent point."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Ailish, "She has."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Just one thing that actually makes sense."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Not while I was here!"
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Onyn, "I'm not special. I'm just here to show people that there is a different way to life."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "If she can, I'll be so stunned she can flee with her life while I recover."
Onyn Scrae'Uden, Hedgeteacher of the Spirits says to Ailish, "Then don't make her repeat herself, because you weren't here, we've acted like fools long enough." [Falling into the godplayer trapÃ¢â¬Â¦now!]
Mortre says, "You're all still here."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says, "If I only show one person what they can achieve on their own then I have succeeded in my task."
Ailish Eraudan says to Onyn, "Quiet. I am not talking to you."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Some people like the sounds of their own voices a bit
much."
Mortre says to Rehari, "Do the axe trick again!"
Sarrius rubs some salve on his skin.
Sarrius says, "Yup."
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder's Shadow says to Sarrius, "Do your axe trick!"
Ailish Eraudan says, "And what precisely do you mean, "on your own"?"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Which one?"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Oh.."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "That one."
Sa'Athien Garess Mahl'Hanna says to Rehari, "Everything I've ever achieved that was worth it, I've achieved on my own. You have nothing to teach me."
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder's Shadow says, "The one where blood gets all over."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Eh."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Are you implying that my actions are not my own?"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Oh, THAT one."
(Sarrius drags Rehari SW and kills her again)
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm yells, "You mean that one?"
You say, "Apparently she's busy."
whodead
Valafar Hlomaren says, "And everone fails again."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "So amusing."
Sa'Athien Garess Mahl'Hanna says, "Can I have the head?"
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder's Shadow says, "And I the heart?"
Ailish Eraudan says to Sarrius, "You know, I was talking to her."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Ailish, "I was too. But I got bored."
Mortre says, "I want the liver!"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Like it matters. He likes to kill."
(CG): Kabaal says, "Stop exhibiting free will already. Bow down to the predetermined plot." [This comment was on CG, but I kept it because it was so appropriate.]
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "My attention span is similar to this coyote here."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Not that I particularly care."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says, "Typically very tiny."
Wysrias Reopev, Sukhder's Shadow says, "What's wrong with killing?"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Farewell, chatterers."
Performer Cireb Murne says, "Violence apparently solves everything in the minds of the people of Aetherius.."
Ailish Eraudan says, "But I wanted to beat her with argument rather than with an axe."
Performer Cireb Murne says, "It's a pity that ti's come to that, honestly.."
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Cireb, "Why yes. It does!"
Ailish Eraudan says, "That I could have done myself a long time ago."
Sa'Athien Garess Mahl'Hanna says to Cireb, "Just about, aye."
You say to Ailish, "To make a long story short, my dear, Rehari wishes to show us how to rip books."
You say to Ailish, "In order to prove that such things mean one is "pure"."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Cireb, when your opinion is needed, it will be given to you."
Performer Cireb Murne says, "I've been around long enough to remember when the realm wasn't just, "Your idea is wrong, you die." Even Antioch and Stavenn held meetings back when I was younger that didn't end in bloodshed.."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Someone of your age really ought to have learned a few things."
Ailish Eraudan says, "First of all, violence solves anything. It might not be the best solution, but it is a solution."
Performer Cireb Murne says, "Someone my age realizes how those that strive to cure things with violence are the same people that I end up getting trimmed when they turn into nice leafy little beings of wonder."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Finally, your comment about hedges and bushes is neither here nor there, and, in fact, is wildly inconsequential to any point of discussion at present."
(Cireb attempts the cart trick, succeeds)
You say to Sarrius, "Old friend, your friendly acolyte has left Dis."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Is that one of her parlor tricks?"
Rehari - Aryana's Spring (1) - ruins of Caanae.
You say, "Let's see what else she has to say."
Rehari, Acolyte of Purity says to Onyn, "Is there a place where we can convine in safety? There are a few people who have taken an interest."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Define "safety"."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Or rather, safe from whom?"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "Your homicidal friend with the axes?"
Redwood Ranger, Sarrius Chytovil, Summer's Storm says to Rehari, "Come back to me when you have learned to fight."
Kamaylie Pyralis says to Rehari, "Depending of who you wish to bring with you, I do have an area."
Valafar Hlomaren says, "I could offer one as well, however it would restrict the guest list."
Ailish Eraudan says to Rehari, "So you preach rejecting Divine Gifts, yet you
accept Divine Grace?"
Valafar Hlomaren says, "It's called "pragmatism."."
Ailish Eraudan says, "Your teachings appear to have some holes in it."</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+1 points with 1 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
