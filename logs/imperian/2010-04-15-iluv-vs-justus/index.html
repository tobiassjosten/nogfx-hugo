A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin 
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of 
utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in 
ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man 
with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue 
of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the 
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.
A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A 
small sign points into a market stall. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze 
cast over the Springs. A pallid stallion stands here idly. A demon resembling 
Hysaara, a shaman's apprentice idly paces here. A squat russet hound paces 
around, slobber dripping from his powerful jaws.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)

spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin 
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of 
utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in 
ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man 
with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue 
of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the 
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.
A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A

apart his innards, causing a maximum of horrifying pain, and, enjoying the

(((YOU HAVE SLAIN Justus.)))
You have slain Justus.">Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of
utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in
ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man
with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue
of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.
A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A
small sign points into a market stall. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze
cast over the Springs. A pallid stallion stands here idly. A demon resembling
Hysaara, a shaman's apprentice idly paces here. A squat russet hound paces
around, slobber dripping from his powerful jaws.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway
leads down.

utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in
ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man
with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue

large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.

A demon resembling Hysaara, a shaman's apprentice pulls back his leg and kicks
Justus with all his might, leaving a nasty gash in his shin.
&lt;512/512h 274/286m 2359e 1319w &lt;e-> &lt;bd>>
Pain grips you, the perfect memory of your sins is too much to bear.

A squat russet hound slashes Justus viciously.
You are not currently riding anything.

Drawing on the power of undeath, you wreathe your hand in black, crackling
energy. With a diabolical laugh, you stiffen your hand and slowly run it down
Justus's chest, splitting it open as you do so. With an expert touch, you rip
apart his innards, causing a maximum of horrifying pain, and, enjoying the
spectacle of Justus writhing and screaming in agony, you rip out his sternum
and drive it through his splayed body, pinning him to the ground to die.
(((YOU HAVE SLAIN Justus.)))
