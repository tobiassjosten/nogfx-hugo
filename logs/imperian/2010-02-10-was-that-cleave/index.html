Markie is already an enemy.
Rock covered cave. (Southwestern Arena.)
The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is
littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another
path in the southeast of this chamber.
You see exits leading east, southeast, and up.
