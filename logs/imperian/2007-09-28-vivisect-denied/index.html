Katsuma calls upon the Lord of the Dead and gives a grave nod to his Seraph, 
whose wings flare suddenly as an alien and frightening look of power sweeps 
across her face. With one hand, the Seraph reaches forward, and as her hand 
touches your chest, it flares an impossibly bright white, and enters your 
breast. The Seraph's eyes roll back in its head and as your soul is torn 
screaming from your body, you collapse to the ground in neverending, inhuman 
pain.
You have been slain by Katsuma.
You are OUT of the combat free-for-all!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. 
Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. There 
are 6 charcoal cinders in 6 groups here.
You see a single exit leading down.

Katsuma calls upon the Lord of the Dead and gives a grave nod to his Seraph,
whose wings flare suddenly as an alien and frightening look of power sweeps
across her face. With one hand, the Seraph reaches forward, and as her hand
touches your chest, it flares an impossibly bright white, and enters your
breast. The Seraph's eyes roll back in its head and as your soul is torn
screaming from your body, you collapse to the ground in neverending, inhuman
pain.
You have been slain by Katsuma.
You are OUT of the combat free-for-all!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.
Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area. There
are 6 charcoal cinders in 6 groups here.
You see a single exit leading down.
