Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A rune circle has been
sketched into the ground here. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A
sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A runic
totem is planted solidly in the ground. Ovad, the mason, stands here staring at
the ground.
You see exits leading north, northeast (open door), southeast, southwest (open
door), west (open door), and northwest.
Ovad, the mason exclaims, "Some day Lord Zanik will have me cover the whole
world with concrete!"
Ovad, the mason drifts away from the conversation, lost in his daydreams.

-moved north-

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Ohh."

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Who was that."

You say, "Ovad, some idiot who gets killed every time he comes in the city and
still doesn&#39;t get the hint."

You say, "I got sick of putting any effort into it."

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Maybe I could burn him too, if Dregaur will
let me."

You say, "Well... maybe we could..."

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

A small boy named Vyzerath exclaims, "Oohh, could we send him somewhere, all
fired up!"

"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.

You say, "You sure are a sadistic one... I like that..."

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

You say to Ovad, the mason, "I think we should all have a friendly little
chat..."

(Stavenn): You say, "Somebody want to help me hold down Ovad?"

Ovad, the mason says, "You want to talk to me? You&#39;re always yelling at me."

(Stavenn): Remiel says, "How? shrivel?"

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Well, now I want to talk..."

(Stavenn): You say, "Just grab him, I don&#39;t know."

Kenikia arrives from the southeast.

Ovad, the mason peers at you unscrupulously.

Ovad, the mason says, "You have something you want built?"

(Stavenn): You say, "I&#39;m sick of him always coming into Stavenn and I want to
make sure when he dies this time he doesn&#39;t come back."

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Uh... sure, let&#39;s call it that."

Kenikia smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

Disci Prae Kenikia, of the First Circle says to Ovad, the mason, "Yes we need
something built."

Ovad, the mason ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."

Ovad, the mason says, "Very well, what might that be? Another torture area for
the unsuspecting?"

Kenikia smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

You whisper to a small boy named Vyzerath, "How strong is that demon of yours?"

You say, "Not a torture room, we aren&#39;t all sadists, one is enough."

Disci Prae Kenikia, of the First Circle says to Ovad, the mason, "How about a
secret tunnel?"

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Look, it&#39;s either you come with us or we can go
ahead with the usual method and we can kill you right now."
Ovad, the mason says, "I&#39;m only interested in honest work. Something that makes
a man sweat for his daily share."

A small boy named Vyzerath tells you, "He&#39;s pretty strong, helped keep away
some who tried to convert me to Baarites."

You tell a small boy named Vyzerath, "Think he can hold down Ovad long enough
for us to replace him with that fat kid you burned up?"

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the southeast.
Ovad, the mason looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Comprehension flashes across Ovad, the mason&#39;s face.
Ovad, the mason says, "Iloum, didn&#39;t I see your name drawn in some concrete I
slapped down?"

Ovad, the mason says, "Hardly much of a choice is it? But if you have something
you need done, far be it for me to deny work."

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the west.

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the west.
Ovad, the mason gives a pained sigh.
Ovad, the mason says, "I really need to find some work to earn a few
sovereigns."

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the north.

You say, "Well, then come with me."

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the north.
Ovad, the mason exclaims, "Some day Lord Zanik will have me cover the whole
world with concrete!"
Ovad, the mason drifts away from the conversation, lost in his daydreams.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Lord Zanik..."

Iloum raises an eyebrow at Ovad, the mason.

Iloum tells you, "Why not just kill him."

Ovad, the mason says, "Yes, My Lord."

You tell a small boy named Vyzerath, "Once we get in there, have your orc hold
him down, so we can tie him up and you can deal with him as you like."

Disci Prae Kenikia, of the First Circle says, "Wonder how much it would cost to
dig a tunnel around the girth of antioch and flood it with water so as to make
a giant quicksand pit for it to sink into..."

Kenikia ponders the situation.

You tell Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith, "I want to let Vyzerath have his fun."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Best not to Speak of Lord Zanik here...he has no place
for him here."

Ovad, the mason says, "Pish, the city shouts his name."

You ask Ovad, the mason, "Are you going to follow me or not?"

Ovad, the mason says, "But nont the less."
&amp;lt;326/326h 273/375m 1533e 1775w &amp;lt;eb&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
Ovad, the mason begins to follow you.

Iloum raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Nont the less..."

You say, "He&#39;s Antiochan, ignore him."

Disci Prae Kenikia, of the First Circle says, "None the less indeed."

-Move Spam-

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the southwest.

Iloum nods his head.

You say, "Guess it&#39;s gone."

Comprehension flashes across Iloum&#39;s face.

You say, "Oh well, hold him down anyway."

Iloum greets a small boy named Vyzerath with a sincere smile.

You ask Iloum, "Got any pikes or tall poles we can plant in the ground here?"

A small boy named Vyzerath glances at his orc guard and leans in whispering to
him.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Not at the moment."

Iloum greets a small boy named Vyzerath with a sincere smile.

A small boy named Vyzerath gives Iloum a slow nod.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to a small boy named Vyzerath, "Welcome back to the
Empire."

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the southwest.

-spam-

You tell Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith, "Grabbing the pike?"

Iloum tells you, "Yes."

You say, "Well, good... Iloum is grabbing our equipment."

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the southwest.

You say to Iloum, "Plant the thing in the ground."

A large armoured orc named Belyap picks at a sore as he waits for the boy&#39;s
orders.

Iloum ponders the situation.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith plants a pike in the ground.

You whisper to a small boy named Vyzerath, "Have your orc grab him, and tie him
to the pike."

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Now Belyap, afore he has time to think."

A large armoured orc named Belyap grabs a rope from the folds of his clothes
and charges at Ovad, knocking him down. As Ovad gags from the stench, Belyap
binds him up, tying one end of the rope to the newly staked pike.

Ovad, the mason exclaims, "The hell, the Gods will...gods it stinks, get it
away from me!"

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Now Ovad... I have a question for you... name a
discovery that helped give rise to civilization..."

A small boy named Vyzerath pokes at Ovad, a curious expression on his face as
he listens quietly.

Ovad, the mason exclaims, "The very city you call home is civilization..the
first cornerstone laid gave rise to it!"

You say, "Blah blah blah, just answer the damn question."

Ovad, the mason says, "Very well, how about the finding of ingots in
Kaark&#39;krazul, used by all to protect themselves, your weapons that defend your
home."

You tap your foot with mild impatience.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "That did not give rise to Civilization, nor aide in
it."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Only our defenses."

You say, "It&#39;s fire you idiot."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to you, "He is dense..."

Ovad, the mason says, "..fire..are you mad?"

Iloum stares blanky at Ovad, the mason as his left eye begins to twitch
spasmodically.

You say, "Fire allowed us to cook our food, boil our water."

Ovad, the mason says, "That destroys."

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Lights your homes."

Ovad, the mason says, "Fair enough, when used by those with the mind to use it
wisely...what of it?"

You say, "And it is also a means of education..."

Iloum nods slowly.

You ask a small boy named Vyzerath, "Tell me... how long did the other one last
before Death overtook him?"

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Not long, but long enough to cry like a baby,
mmm..it was good."

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Course, fat burns fast."

Overalls covered in a dry layer of mortar, Ovad appears to be confused as to
what to do with himself. His stocky build is covered with dark brown overalls
which have patches over the knees. His face looks weathered from many years
working under the hot sun.
Ovad, the mason appears to be extraordinarily strong.

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "This guy seems a bit leaner."

A small boy named Vyzerath pulls at Ovad&#39;s clothing, giving his arm a pinch as
if testing something.

You ask, "Yes... how long do you think he&#39;ll last if we light his shoes first
and let it work its way up his body... five minutes maybe?"

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Two minutes and thirty seven seconds...is my guess."

You ask Iloum, "Why do I get the feeling you have some mathimatical formula to
determine that?"

A look of sweetest innocence overtakes Iloum.

A small boy named Vyzerath snickers softly to himself.

You say, "Well, let&#39;s find out..."

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Iloum, think we could make him burn long
enough to send him..home? I&#39;d love to see him light up the city."

Iloum ponders the situation.

You say, "I like the way this kid thinks."

Iloum nods slowly.

Ovad, the mason says, "You are twisted, sick..."

You shrug helplessly.

Ovad, the mason pulls hard against the rope, only to have Belyap place a ooze
covered foot firmly against his chest and hold him down.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "I think...if you were to stick him with a torch in the
chest and pour a bit of accelerant outwards...then perhaps he would run home
aflame."

You exclaim to Ovad, the mason, "Surely you recognize the value that education
has to the growth of Civilization!"

You say to Ovad, the mason, "This isn&#39;t torture, it&#39;s a lesson."
&amp;lt;326/326h 273/375m 1533e 1775w &amp;lt;eb&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
Ovad, the mason spits in your face.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "Come now..."

Ovad, the mason says, "You will pay for any harm done me, you have ot know
that."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "Being lit aflame can be quite
enlightening."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "I do not have ot know that..."

You have emoted: Alitis wipes the spit away from his face, and shakes it off on
Ovad.

Iloum slaps Ovad, the mason on the cheek.

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Let me make something perfectly clear to you..."

You say to Ovad, the mason, "You have been killed dozens of times for your
trespass here, like many others before you."

Belyap gives a yawn as he picks at another sore, dropping some gore on Ovad,
even as he keeps a constant eye on the boy.

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Unlike them, you still haven&#39;t figured out that
you aren&#39;t welcome here."

As Iloum drops a writhing maggot into his mouth, you can see its tail end
slithering against his tongue just before he closes his lips and consumes it
fully.

Iloum gives a writhing maggot to a small boy named Vyzerath.

Ovad, the mason says, "You can&#39;t stop Civilizationyou fool."

You say to Ovad, the mason, "You keep insisting on breaking in... so now
drastic measures must be taken."

Iloum gives a writhing maggot to a large armoured orc named Belyap.

You say to Ovad, the mason, "You aren&#39;t civilization, you are just some random
mason whose head is denser than the stone he works with."

A small boy named Vyzerath holds up a writhing maggot, looking at Iloum
curiously as he asks, "Did I just see you eat one of these?".

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to a small boy named Vyzerath, "O yes...they are quite
tasty and loaded with protien."

As Iloum drops a writhing maggot into his mouth, you can see its tail end
slithering against his tongue just before he closes his lips and consumes it
fully.

You say, "Isadarr started the fad..."
&amp;lt;326/326h 273/375m 1533e 1775w &amp;lt;eb&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gwho

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to a small boy named Vyzerath, "Go ahead...try it."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "I am sure they are tastier than a Kochlan."

Ovad, the mason turns a shade of yellow, trying to avert his eyes away from the
maggots when Belyap leans down and plops the maggot given to him into Ovad&#39;s
mouth. He grabs his jaw and squishes it around, making him chew it up amidst
much gagging and sputtering.

Iloum tells you, "Thats what I was going to do."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "Tasty...no?"

You say, "I prefer Akrabi tail myself... haven&#39;t had that in years..."

A small boy named Vyzerath drops a writhing maggot into his mouth, you can see
its tail end slithering against his tongue just before he closes his lips and
consumes it fully.

Iloum gives a small boy named Vyzerath a slow nod.

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Uh..yeah tasty."

"Mhmm," Iloum murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Have another pike Iloum?"

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "I don&#39;t but I can surely get one."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "I will return."

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the southwest.

You ask Ovad, the mason, "Now, before we send you on your way, a thought
occurs... do you believe that the sciences help civilization grow?"

You ask Ovad, the mason, "You know science, right? Research? Learning about
things we don&#39;t know about?"

Ovad, the mason says, "In the hands of someone wise enough to know what to do
with the sciences sure, look at the grand clock tower in Antioch, only one of
science could have contrived such a thing."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "I have it."

Iloum closes his eyes and inhales.

Iloum jabbers at Ovad, the mason unrelentingly, pestering him like an old
fishwife.

You ask Ovad, the mason, "Then why do followers of your Lord seek to prevent
the research of certain sciences?"

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Namely, that of magick and demonology."

You say to Ovad, the mason, "And before you say "they&#39;re too dangerous", if
that&#39;s your defense..."

You say to Ovad, the mason, "There is a nice big crater in the heartlands where
the great rock used to be, and magick didn&#39;t have a thing to do with it."

Ovad, the mason says, "Perhaps not, but what you all play with is not
controllable, it is too unpredictable."

say to ovad Oh you ignorant fool... it is only unpredictable to you because you

know nothing about it. It&#39;s alright, I was once like you, blind, lost, but then

I saw the light... or fire if you will

-Got DC&#39;d here, for some reason the last command I send goes through but I don&#39;t

get anything back from the server and my internet drops completely, so I fix it

real quick and log back in-

A small boy named Vyzerath glances at Alitis, a glimmer of hope flashing in his
eyes before turning his eyes back to look at Ovad.

You ask, "Did he say anything in response to the last thing I said?"

Iloum shakes his head.

You say, "Good, didn&#39;t miss it then."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "He just lays there."

Ovad, the mason says, "No, your friend was telling me how I annoy him."

Iloum savagely kicks Ovad, the mason in the shin, pouting with a vengeance.

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Well... just as I saw and learned to follow the
fires... so shall you."

Ovad, the mason says, "Is that the best you can do, you&#39;ve said or done nothing
to keep me from returning, just words."

You say, "And so will Antioch when you run there..."

Ovad, the mason says, "You..wouldn&#39;t."

You say, "You&#39;re right, I wouldn&#39;t."

You say to a small boy named Vyzerath, "Cook him."

A small boy named Vyzerath claps his hands together merrily.

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Pike and cloth Iloum?"

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith with a pike and cloth in hand begins to bind the wrists of
Ovad, the mason over his head limiting his mobility.

"Mhmm," Iloum murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Set it on fire and let him run."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "You will run back to Antioch with a
halo of flame around your head."

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "I&#39;ll hold the pike, you got the mind to pound
it in? I&#39;m not that strong yet. Once he&#39;s stuck up all good, we can wrap the
cloth around it the end and torch it."

Iloum ponders the situation.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Very well."

Iloum takes up a pike in his right hand.

"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "This will be pleasent."

Ovad, the mason kneels humbly on the ground, uttering prayers to the Gods.

You say, "Your gods won&#39;t save you..."

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith grips a pike with both hands and raising it high over his
head rams it down into the chest of Ovad, the mason.

You say, "I&#39;ve been told that before."

You say, "I&#39;m still waiting to rue a day."

Ovad, the mason howls in intense pain, the sound carrying through the entire
city.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith wraps a few pieces of cloth around the the pike allowing it
to catch aflame.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith wipes a bit of blood from his face.

Iloum rubs his hands together and grins evilly at Ovad, the mason.

You say to Ovad, the mason, "Run b****."

A small boy named Vyzerath leans down and blows and fans the flame, laughing
with total pleasure as Ovad&#39;s clothes catch aflame.

You ask Ovad, the mason, "Do I need to repeat myself?"

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the southwest.

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the southwest.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "Go now...while the door is open."

Iloum points to the southwest.

Iloum Vian&#39;Cirith says, "Go that way."

Sending fingers of fire around the room, Ovad flees to the southwest.

Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the southwest.

Stumbling a bit, a small boy moves quietly to the southwest.

-Yah, I moved SW too-

(Stavenn): Iloum says, "Watch out for Ovad...he seems to have caught himself on
fire."

Howling in terror Ovad enters from the northeast.

Sending fingers of fire around the room, Ovad flees to the southwest.'>Imperial Parade passing the Academy. (City of Stavenn.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A rune circle has been
sketched into the ground here. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A
sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A runic
totem is planted solidly in the ground. Ovad, the mason, stands here staring at
the ground.
You see exits leading north, northeast (open door), southeast, southwest (open
door), west (open door), and northwest.
Ovad, the mason exclaims, "Some day Lord Zanik will have me cover the whole
world with concrete!"
Ovad, the mason drifts away from the conversation, lost in his daydreams.

A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Ohh."

You say, "Ovad, some idiot who gets killed every time he comes in the city and

You say, "I got sick of putting any effort into it."
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Maybe I could burn him too, if Dregaur will

You say, "Well... maybe we could..."
You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

Ovad, the mason says, "You want to talk to me? You're always yelling at me."
(Stavenn): Remiel says, "How? shrivel?"
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Well, now I want to talk..."
(Stavenn): You say, "Just grab him, I don't know."
Kenikia arrives from the southeast.
Ovad, the mason peers at you unscrupulously.
Ovad, the mason says, "You have something you want built?"
(Stavenn): You say, "I'm sick of him always coming into Stavenn and I want to
make sure when he dies this time he doesn't come back."
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Uh... sure, let's call it that."
Kenikia smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.
Disci Prae Kenikia, of the First Circle says to Ovad, the mason, "Yes we need
something built."
Ovad, the mason ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."
Ovad, the mason says, "Very well, what might that be? Another torture area for
the unsuspecting?"
Kenikia smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.
You whisper to a small boy named Vyzerath, "How strong is that demon of yours?"
You say, "Not a torture room, we aren't all sadists, one is enough."
Disci Prae Kenikia, of the First Circle says to Ovad, the mason, "How about a
secret tunnel?"
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Look, it's either you come with us or we can go
ahead with the usual method and we can kill you right now."
Ovad, the mason says, "I'm only interested in honest work. Something that makes
a man sweat for his daily share."
A small boy named Vyzerath tells you, "He's pretty strong, helped keep away
some who tried to convert me to Baarites."
You tell a small boy named Vyzerath, "Think he can hold down Ovad long enough
for us to replace him with that fat kid you burned up?"
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the southeast.
Ovad, the mason looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Comprehension flashes across Ovad, the mason's face.
Ovad, the mason says, "Iloum, didn't I see your name drawn in some concrete I
slapped down?"
Ovad, the mason says, "Hardly much of a choice is it? But if you have something
you need done, far be it for me to deny work."
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the west.
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the west.
Ovad, the mason gives a pained sigh.
Ovad, the mason says, "I really need to find some work to earn a few
sovereigns."
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the north.
You say, "Well, then come with me."
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the north.
Ovad, the mason exclaims, "Some day Lord Zanik will have me cover the whole
world with concrete!"
Ovad, the mason drifts away from the conversation, lost in his daydreams.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Lord Zanik..."
Iloum raises an eyebrow at Ovad, the mason.
Iloum tells you, "Why not just kill him."
Ovad, the mason says, "Yes, My Lord."
You tell a small boy named Vyzerath, "Once we get in there, have your orc hold
him down, so we can tie him up and you can deal with him as you like."
Disci Prae Kenikia, of the First Circle says, "Wonder how much it would cost to
dig a tunnel around the girth of antioch and flood it with water so as to make
a giant quicksand pit for it to sink into..."
Kenikia ponders the situation.
You tell Iloum Vian'Cirith, "I want to let Vyzerath have his fun."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Best not to Speak of Lord Zanik here...he has no place
for him here."
Ovad, the mason says, "Pish, the city shouts his name."
You ask Ovad, the mason, "Are you going to follow me or not?"
Ovad, the mason says, "But nont the less."
&amp;lt;326/326h 273/375m 1533e 1775w &amp;lt;eb&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
Ovad, the mason begins to follow you.
Iloum raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Nont the less..."
You say, "He's Antiochan, ignore him."
Disci Prae Kenikia, of the First Circle says, "None the less indeed."
-Move Spam-
You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the southwest.
Iloum nods his head.
You say, "Guess it's gone."
Comprehension flashes across Iloum's face.
You say, "Oh well, hold him down anyway."
Iloum greets a small boy named Vyzerath with a sincere smile.
You ask Iloum, "Got any pikes or tall poles we can plant in the ground here?"
A small boy named Vyzerath glances at his orc guard and leans in whispering to
him.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Not at the moment."
Iloum greets a small boy named Vyzerath with a sincere smile.
A small boy named Vyzerath gives Iloum a slow nod.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to a small boy named Vyzerath, "Welcome back to the
Empire."
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the southwest.
-spam-
You tell Iloum Vian'Cirith, "Grabbing the pike?"
Iloum tells you, "Yes."
You say, "Well, good... Iloum is grabbing our equipment."
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the southwest.
You say to Iloum, "Plant the thing in the ground."
A large armoured orc named Belyap picks at a sore as he waits for the boy's
orders.
Iloum ponders the situation.
Iloum Vian'Cirith plants a pike in the ground.
You whisper to a small boy named Vyzerath, "Have your orc grab him, and tie him
to the pike."
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Now Belyap, afore he has time to think."
A large armoured orc named Belyap grabs a rope from the folds of his clothes
and charges at Ovad, knocking him down. As Ovad gags from the stench, Belyap
binds him up, tying one end of the rope to the newly staked pike.
Ovad, the mason exclaims, "The hell, the Gods will...gods it stinks, get it
away from me!"
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Now Ovad... I have a question for you... name a
discovery that helped give rise to civilization..."
A small boy named Vyzerath pokes at Ovad, a curious expression on his face as
he listens quietly.
Ovad, the mason exclaims, "The very city you call home is civilization..the
first cornerstone laid gave rise to it!"
You say, "Blah blah blah, just answer the damn question."
Ovad, the mason says, "Very well, how about the finding of ingots in
Kaark'krazul, used by all to protect themselves, your weapons that defend your
home."
You tap your foot with mild impatience.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "That did not give rise to Civilization, nor aide in
it."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Only our defenses."
You say, "It's fire you idiot."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to you, "He is dense..."
Ovad, the mason says, "..fire..are you mad?"
Iloum stares blanky at Ovad, the mason as his left eye begins to twitch
spasmodically.
You say, "Fire allowed us to cook our food, boil our water."
Ovad, the mason says, "That destroys."
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Lights your homes."
Ovad, the mason says, "Fair enough, when used by those with the mind to use it
wisely...what of it?"
You say, "And it is also a means of education..."
Iloum nods slowly.
You ask a small boy named Vyzerath, "Tell me... how long did the other one last
before Death overtook him?"
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Not long, but long enough to cry like a baby,
mmm..it was good."
You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Course, fat burns fast."
Overalls covered in a dry layer of mortar, Ovad appears to be confused as to
what to do with himself. His stocky build is covered with dark brown overalls
which have patches over the knees. His face looks weathered from many years
working under the hot sun.
Ovad, the mason appears to be extraordinarily strong.
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "This guy seems a bit leaner."
A small boy named Vyzerath pulls at Ovad's clothing, giving his arm a pinch as
if testing something.
You ask, "Yes... how long do you think he'll last if we light his shoes first
and let it work its way up his body... five minutes maybe?"
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Two minutes and thirty seven seconds...is my guess."
You ask Iloum, "Why do I get the feeling you have some mathimatical formula to
determine that?"
A look of sweetest innocence overtakes Iloum.
A small boy named Vyzerath snickers softly to himself.
You say, "Well, let's find out..."
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Iloum, think we could make him burn long
enough to send him..home? I'd love to see him light up the city."
Iloum ponders the situation.
You say, "I like the way this kid thinks."
Iloum nods slowly.
Ovad, the mason says, "You are twisted, sick..."
You shrug helplessly.
Ovad, the mason pulls hard against the rope, only to have Belyap place a ooze
covered foot firmly against his chest and hold him down.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "I think...if you were to stick him with a torch in the
chest and pour a bit of accelerant outwards...then perhaps he would run home
aflame."
You exclaim to Ovad, the mason, "Surely you recognize the value that education
has to the growth of Civilization!"
You say to Ovad, the mason, "This isn't torture, it's a lesson."
&amp;lt;326/326h 273/375m 1533e 1775w &amp;lt;eb&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
Ovad, the mason spits in your face.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "Come now..."
Ovad, the mason says, "You will pay for any harm done me, you have ot know
that."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "Being lit aflame can be quite
enlightening."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "I do not have ot know that..."
You have emoted: Alitis wipes the spit away from his face, and shakes it off on
Ovad.
Iloum slaps Ovad, the mason on the cheek.
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Let me make something perfectly clear to you..."
You say to Ovad, the mason, "You have been killed dozens of times for your
trespass here, like many others before you."
Belyap gives a yawn as he picks at another sore, dropping some gore on Ovad,
even as he keeps a constant eye on the boy.
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Unlike them, you still haven't figured out that
you aren't welcome here."
As Iloum drops a writhing maggot into his mouth, you can see its tail end
slithering against his tongue just before he closes his lips and consumes it
fully.
Iloum gives a writhing maggot to a small boy named Vyzerath.
Ovad, the mason says, "You can't stop Civilizationyou fool."
You say to Ovad, the mason, "You keep insisting on breaking in... so now
drastic measures must be taken."
Iloum gives a writhing maggot to a large armoured orc named Belyap.
You say to Ovad, the mason, "You aren't civilization, you are just some random
mason whose head is denser than the stone he works with."
A small boy named Vyzerath holds up a writhing maggot, looking at Iloum
curiously as he asks, "Did I just see you eat one of these?".
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to a small boy named Vyzerath, "O yes...they are quite
tasty and loaded with protien."
As Iloum drops a writhing maggot into his mouth, you can see its tail end
slithering against his tongue just before he closes his lips and consumes it
fully.
You say, "Isadarr started the fad..."
&amp;lt;326/326h 273/375m 1533e 1775w &amp;lt;eb&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gwho
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to a small boy named Vyzerath, "Go ahead...try it."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "I am sure they are tastier than a Kochlan."
Ovad, the mason turns a shade of yellow, trying to avert his eyes away from the
maggots when Belyap leans down and plops the maggot given to him into Ovad's
mouth. He grabs his jaw and squishes it around, making him chew it up amidst
much gagging and sputtering.
Iloum tells you, "Thats what I was going to do."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "Tasty...no?"
You say, "I prefer Akrabi tail myself... haven't had that in years..."
A small boy named Vyzerath drops a writhing maggot into his mouth, you can see
its tail end slithering against his tongue just before he closes his lips and
consumes it fully.
Iloum gives a small boy named Vyzerath a slow nod.
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Uh..yeah tasty."
"Mhmm," Iloum murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Have another pike Iloum?"
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "I don't but I can surely get one."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "I will return."
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the southwest.
You ask Ovad, the mason, "Now, before we send you on your way, a thought
occurs... do you believe that the sciences help civilization grow?"
You ask Ovad, the mason, "You know science, right? Research? Learning about
things we don't know about?"
Ovad, the mason says, "In the hands of someone wise enough to know what to do
with the sciences sure, look at the grand clock tower in Antioch, only one of
science could have contrived such a thing."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "I have it."
Iloum closes his eyes and inhales.
Iloum jabbers at Ovad, the mason unrelentingly, pestering him like an old
fishwife.
You ask Ovad, the mason, "Then why do followers of your Lord seek to prevent
the research of certain sciences?"
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Namely, that of magick and demonology."
You say to Ovad, the mason, "And before you say "they're too dangerous", if
that's your defense..."
You say to Ovad, the mason, "There is a nice big crater in the heartlands where
the great rock used to be, and magick didn't have a thing to do with it."
Ovad, the mason says, "Perhaps not, but what you all play with is not
controllable, it is too unpredictable."
say to ovad Oh you ignorant fool... it is only unpredictable to you because you
know nothing about it. It's alright, I was once like you, blind, lost, but then
I saw the light... or fire if you will
-Got DC'd here, for some reason the last command I send goes through but I don't
get anything back from the server and my internet drops completely, so I fix it
real quick and log back in-
A small boy named Vyzerath glances at Alitis, a glimmer of hope flashing in his
eyes before turning his eyes back to look at Ovad.
You ask, "Did he say anything in response to the last thing I said?"
Iloum shakes his head.
You say, "Good, didn't miss it then."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "He just lays there."
Ovad, the mason says, "No, your friend was telling me how I annoy him."
Iloum savagely kicks Ovad, the mason in the shin, pouting with a vengeance.
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Well... just as I saw and learned to follow the
fires... so shall you."
Ovad, the mason says, "Is that the best you can do, you've said or done nothing
to keep me from returning, just words."
You say, "And so will Antioch when you run there..."
Ovad, the mason says, "You..wouldn't."
You say, "You're right, I wouldn't."
You say to a small boy named Vyzerath, "Cook him."
A small boy named Vyzerath claps his hands together merrily.
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "Pike and cloth Iloum?"
Iloum Vian'Cirith with a pike and cloth in hand begins to bind the wrists of
Ovad, the mason over his head limiting his mobility.
"Mhmm," Iloum murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Set it on fire and let him run."
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "You will run back to Antioch with a
halo of flame around your head."
A small boy named Vyzerath says, "I'll hold the pike, you got the mind to pound
it in? I'm not that strong yet. Once he's stuck up all good, we can wrap the
cloth around it the end and torch it."
Iloum ponders the situation.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Very well."
Iloum takes up a pike in his right hand.
"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "This will be pleasent."
Ovad, the mason kneels humbly on the ground, uttering prayers to the Gods.
You say, "Your gods won't save you..."
Iloum Vian'Cirith grips a pike with both hands and raising it high over his
head rams it down into the chest of Ovad, the mason.
You say, "I've been told that before."
You say, "I'm still waiting to rue a day."
Ovad, the mason howls in intense pain, the sound carrying through the entire
city.
Iloum Vian'Cirith wraps a few pieces of cloth around the the pike allowing it
to catch aflame.
Iloum Vian'Cirith wipes a bit of blood from his face.
Iloum rubs his hands together and grins evilly at Ovad, the mason.
You say to Ovad, the mason, "Run b****."
A small boy named Vyzerath leans down and blows and fans the flame, laughing
with total pleasure as Ovad's clothes catch aflame.
You ask Ovad, the mason, "Do I need to repeat myself?"
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the southwest.
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros arrives from the southwest.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says to Ovad, the mason, "Go now...while the door is open."
Iloum points to the southwest.
Iloum Vian'Cirith says, "Go that way."
Sending fingers of fire around the room, Ovad flees to the southwest.
Iloum, riding a black ouroboros leaves to the southwest.
Stumbling a bit, a small boy moves quietly to the southwest.
-Yah, I moved SW too-
(Stavenn): Iloum says, "Watch out for Ovad...he seems to have caught himself on
fire."
Howling in terror Ovad enters from the northeast.
Sending fingers of fire around the room, Ovad flees to the southwest.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>+3 points with 5 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
