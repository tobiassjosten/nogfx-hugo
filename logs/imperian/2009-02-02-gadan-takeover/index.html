They are followed by Samiel, a crimson storm couatl, a demon resembling the wizard Hycanthus, and a wild rabid hound.

You have emoted: Miana twirls a galingale flower between her thumb and forefinger, waiting for the nod of the Imperator.

Imperator Sagron Savet says to you, "A moment."

Kye&#39;s forked tongue flickers out briefly as she tests the air.

You nod your head.

Sagron gives a gold and obsidian banner to Felreign Trez Blackmoor of the Order of Murder.

Sagron gives a leather banner of indigo and gold to Felreign Trez Blackmoor of the Order of Murder.

Sagron gives a gold and obsidian banner to Felreign Trez Blackmoor of the Order of Murder.

Linslet cracks her knuckles, furrowing her brow in determination.

Imperator Sagron Savet says to Trez, "Implant those as you see fit."

Sagron drops a demon shaped brazier.

Sagron pats a demon shaped brazier in a friendly manner.

Linslet grins mischievously at Sagron.

Sagron attaches a flame-shaped sigil to a demon shaped brazier.

Trez gives Sagron an acknowledging nod.

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot says, "It feels almost like home!"

Linslet gives a demon shaped brazier a compassionate hug.

You smirk.

Sagron gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

Imperator Sagron Savet says to you, "Begin the first ritual."

You have emoted: Miana lifts her chin slightly in acknowledgment of the Imperator&#39;s movement. She begins to pluck the petals from the flower, grinding one before placing it in her mouth. As she removes the rest of the petals and grinds them, she begins to create a circle of destroyed galingale. Flower after flower of galingale is used until a solid circle is created.

You quickly eat a galingale flower.

A whirling cloud of black smoke interspersed with crimson flames hovers just above those gathered. A rasping, enigmatic voice says, "My blessings upon you all, in this task. I do enjoy things being taken from Khandava...".

You have emoted: Miana takes her daegger up into her hand and slices into her forearm without a flinch. She traces the circle with her steps, blood dripping over the fallen petals. When the circle is complete, she uses her tinderbox to burn the flesh of her arm to stop the bleeding. The scent of dying flesh wafts through the area.

Linslet performs a graceful curtsey.

You have emoted: Miana takes up handful of fenugreek berries in her right hand. Her eyes flash a wicked black for a brief moment as she begins to mutter something unintelligible. With her other hand, she grinds the berries and begins applying it to her arms, hands, face, and neck.

You apply a fenugreek berry to yourself.

You have emoted: Miana kneels low to the ground, carving a second circle within the first. "I need blood," she states. She points to the crevice in the ground and waits for somebody to offer their blood to fill it.

You raise an eyebrow questioningly.

The corrupted light of Argum begins to decline in a shadowy haze, ameliorating with a crimson hue.

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot draws her dirk across her palm, thrusting her hand to the crevice.

Sagron gives Linslet an acknowledging nod.

You have emoted: Miana nods approvingly before kneeling once more. She carves a triangle within the inner circle, each vertex connecting to the circle. Slowly, it, too, begins to fill with blood. Her lips turn up into a malicious smirk. Reaching into the folds of her cloak, she removes a small velvet pouch and begins to sprinkle its contents along the triangle. The substance is salt.

Using your daegger, you open a vein in your wrist, and let the blood drip to outline a pentagram, floating waist-high.

A grotesque and enormous eyeball floats up from the roiling blood in the pentagram, trailing long tendrils of blood and gore.

You have emoted: Miana watches intently as the eye floats to the center of the triangle and begins to spin rapidly.

You say, "Protection is in place, and vigilance shall be our ally. Let us crush these fools to nothing but bone and dust and claim this towne in the name of the Empire."

Sagron gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

Alaia, Caitryn, and Samiel leave to the ether following Verick.
They are followed by Samiel, a crimson storm couatl, a demon resembling the wizard Hycanthus, and a wild rabid hound.

p pit

It is a marvel that this pit has been created, for the ground within which it was dug has frozen to the consistency of the toughest stone. The rough edges of the pit indicate it was dug with great haste, and bits of paving littering its bottom hint that it has interrupted some sort of construction. The faint outline of some strange shape looms on the bottom of the pit, although its precise structure is impossible to see.
It is strangely weightless.
A deep pit is holding:
"Xiur (dead)51334"       the corpse of a Xiur woman

Myrmidon Takai says, "May I ask what the point of this pit is?"

Kye Nessaja DeviSeer follows suit, kneeling and disembowling another corpse, tossing its entrails into the pit, then its hacked limbs one by one with her bloody arms glistening in he hellish glow.

You have emoted: Miana whispers in a sing-song voice, "What next, what next!" She circles the piles of corpses before stopping next to the dead corpse of a lycaean knight.

Imperator Sagron Savet says to Takai, "The demons crave the flesh of fools so full of life as these Khandavan serfs. This helps to bring them closer to the realm we reside upon."

You see the following people here:
Linslet, Salish, Takai, Kye, Sagron, Miana

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot Jumps onto the corpse of the xiur postman, grinning widely as she brandishes a dirk in each hand.

You have emoted: Miana snickers softly, removing a length of rope from her pack. She ties it around the lengths of the dead soldier before finding a place to properly tie it up. She hoists the corpse into the air. Her daegger slices through the throat of the knight and then its arms, its blood pooling on the ground beneath it. When the blood begins to trickle lightly, she cuts the corpse down and tosses it into the pit after dismembering it.

You pick up the corpse of an aurulent Lycaean knight.

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot hums idly as she carves into the body, blood spraying in many directions before she stands up, picking up the body and showing off her handiwork, her full name carved quite elegantly into the Xiur&#39;s chest.

Linslet claps her hands together merrily.

Linslet grins mischievously.

You ask, "Does anybody have a hammer?"

Kye&#39;s forked tongue flickers out briefly as she tests the air.

Midnight tolls and a new day comes to the land.
It is the 19th day of Ferinus, in the year 571 AD.

A ravenous hound takes off running at Sagron&#39;s command, a delivery of some sort held tightly in its jaws.

Kye quivers like a tightly strung wire.

You have emoted: Miana violently begins to smash the skull of the chief with the blackened warhammer until it is nothing but pebbles and dust. Squished eyeballs lay smooshed against the ground, the tongue a flattened piece of flesh. She continues to destroy the rest of the corpse before taking her daegger back up into her hand and pushing the remains--and scraping what she can--into the pit.

You pick up the corpse of Gadin, Chief of Gadan Hold.

p pit

It is a marvel that this pit has been created, for the ground within which it was dug has frozen to the consistency of the toughest stone. The rough edges of the pit indicate it was dug with great haste, and bits of paving littering its bottom hint that it has interrupted some sort of construction. The faint outline of some strange shape looms on the bottom of the pit, although its precise structure is impossible to see.
It is strangely weightless.
A deep pit is holding:

She begins carving into his skull, and creating two small holes as she digs into the bone and then brain.

p pit

It is a marvel that this pit has been created, for the ground within which it was dug has frozen to the consistency of the toughest stone. The rough edges of the pit indicate it was dug with great haste, and bits of paving littering its bottom hint that it has interrupted some sort of construction. The faint outline of some strange shape looms on the bottom of the pit, although its precise structure is impossible to see.
It is strangely weightless.

You have emoted: Miana meanders towards the broken corpse of the young elven girl before stepping onto her chest. The sickening sound of her ribs and sternum crunching echoes through the room. Miana jumps once and the torso visibly deflates. She kneels down over the face of the girl, still standing on the corpse. She ponders for a moment, before sticking her daegger into the dead girl&#39;s mouth. She slices into the the cheeks before continuing to carve around the face. Carefully, she removes the face, revealing a bloodied skull.

You have emoted: Miana snickers wickedly as she tosses the face into the pit before returning her attention to the girl&#39;s head. Slowly, she cuts into the flesh around the ears, removing each before idly throwing them into the pit. Carefully, she drags the daegger around the girl&#39;s head, scalping her with deft precision. She continues to messily hack off each limb before pushing the remains into the pit.

The sky darkens with demonic and terrible shadows, as Argum descends for the evening, within the confines of the Empire.

The flames leap into the air from the depths of the pit, once again radiating a  crimson light that serves as a beacon of shadowed light above Gadan.

-- coming to the end --

You have emoted: Miana nods her head with an approving smirk playing across her lips. She takes her daegger into her hand and kneels on the ground, carving a circle around the demonic pit. A muffled chant escapes her lips as she cuts into her own flesh to fill the circle with blood. With delicate attention, she begins to sprinkle blackpowder within the blood-filled crevice.

The crimson flames surge brilliantly, casting shadows over those gathered. The pit begins to fold in upon itself as the flames rise higher and higher.

With a puff of smoke and a flash of crimson light, the pit is gone. A symbol remains where it once was.

You look on in astonishment as a deep pit fades away into the ether.

You smirk at a bloody pentagram.

You follow Sagron to the ether. (following)
Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles listlessly in the wind. An ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally decorated pedestal here. The dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, black cross.

You have emoted: Miana twirls a galingale flower between her thumb and forefinger, waiting for the nod of the Imperator.

Linslet gives a demon shaped brazier a compassionate hug.
You smirk.
Sagron gives you a nod of acknowledgement.
Imperator Sagron Savet says to you, "Begin the first ritual."
You have emoted: Miana lifts her chin slightly in acknowledgment of the Imperator's movement. She begins to pluck the petals from the flower, grinding one before placing it in her mouth. As she removes the rest of the petals and grinds them, she begins to create a circle of destroyed galingale. Flower after flower of galingale is used until a solid circle is created.
You quickly eat a galingale flower.
A whirling cloud of black smoke interspersed with crimson flames hovers just above those gathered. A rasping, enigmatic voice says, "My blessings upon you all, in this task. I do enjoy things being taken from Khandava...".
You have emoted: Miana takes her daegger up into her hand and slices into her forearm without a flinch. She traces the circle with her steps, blood dripping over the fallen petals. When the circle is complete, she uses her tinderbox to burn the flesh of her arm to stop the bleeding. The scent of dying flesh wafts through the area.
Linslet performs a graceful curtsey.
You have emoted: Miana takes up handful of fenugreek berries in her right hand. Her eyes flash a wicked black for a brief moment as she begins to mutter something unintelligible. With her other hand, she grinds the berries and begins applying it to her arms, hands, face, and neck.
You apply a fenugreek berry to yourself.
You have emoted: Miana kneels low to the ground, carving a second circle within the first. "I need blood," she states. She points to the crevice in the ground and waits for somebody to offer their blood to fill it.
You raise an eyebrow questioningly.
The corrupted light of Argum begins to decline in a shadowy haze, ameliorating with a crimson hue.
The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot draws her dirk across her palm, thrusting her hand to the crevice.
Sagron gives Linslet an acknowledging nod.
You have emoted: Miana nods approvingly before kneeling once more. She carves a triangle within the inner circle, each vertex connecting to the circle. Slowly, it, too, begins to fill with blood. Her lips turn up into a malicious smirk. Reaching into the folds of her cloak, she removes a small velvet pouch and begins to sprinkle its contents along the triangle. The substance is salt.
Using your daegger, you open a vein in your wrist, and let the blood drip to outline a pentagram, floating waist-high.
A grotesque and enormous eyeball floats up from the roiling blood in the pentagram, trailing long tendrils of blood and gore.
You have emoted: Miana watches intently as the eye floats to the center of the triangle and begins to spin rapidly.
You say, "Protection is in place, and vigilance shall be our ally. Let us crush these fools to nothing but bone and dust and claim this towne in the name of the Empire."
Sagron gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

p pit
It is a marvel that this pit has been created, for the ground within which it was dug has frozen to the consistency of the toughest stone. The rough edges of the pit indicate it was dug with great haste, and bits of paving littering its bottom hint that it has interrupted some sort of construction. The faint outline of some strange shape looms on the bottom of the pit, although its precise structure is impossible to see.
It is strangely weightless.

p pit
It is a marvel that this pit has been created, for the ground within which it was dug has frozen to the consistency of the toughest stone. The rough edges of the pit indicate it was dug with great haste, and bits of paving littering its bottom hint that it has interrupted some sort of construction. The faint outline of some strange shape looms on the bottom of the pit, although its precise structure is impossible to see.
It is strangely weightless.

Miana jumps once and the torso visibly deflates. She kneels down over the face of the girl, still standing on the corpse. She ponders for a moment, before sticking her daegger into the dead girl's mouth. She slices into the the cheeks before continuing to carve around the face. Carefully, she removes the face, revealing a bloodied skull.
You have emoted: Miana snickers wickedly as she tosses the face into the pit before returning her attention to the girl's head. Slowly, she cuts into the flesh around the ears, removing each before idly throwing them into the pit. Carefully, she drags the daegger around the girl's head, scalping her with deft precision. She continues to messily hack off each limb before pushing the remains into the pit.

The sky darkens with demonic and terrible shadows, as Argum descends for the evening, within the confines of the Empire.
The flames leap into the air from the depths of the pit, once again radiating a crimson light that serves as a beacon of shadowed light above Gadan.
-- coming to the end --
You have emoted: Miana nods her head with an approving smirk playing across her lips. She takes her daegger into her hand and kneels on the ground, carving a circle around the demonic pit. A muffled chant escapes her lips as she cuts into her own flesh to fill the circle with blood. With delicate attention, she begins to sprinkle blackpowder within the blood-filled crevice.
The crimson flames surge brilliantly, casting shadows over those gathered. The pit begins to fold in upon itself as the flames rise higher and higher.

A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. There are 4 armoured battle stallions here. A bench made from old, overly used weapons and armour has been placed here. An elegant copper rose and cobalt blue stained-glass vase displays an elegant black rose. There are 13 Diavlous Knights here. An elegantly dressed Noctusari is manning a cannon here. He has seventy-one cannon balls. There are 15 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with the crest of the Empire ripples regally from the columns of the gates. A black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold, at full mast upon a narrow pole has been implanted here. A shaggy grey mustang roams warily nearby. A pike with the decapitated head of Zephurus has been erected. There are 2 whiskered catfish here. There are 8 corpses of an ironwood chipmunk here. Legs and tail curled into itself, a gray woodchuck lies here in a pool of blood. There are 2 corpses of a mottled groundhog here. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. The undead form of Lachlan Qel'Daithe, Tashmit Idun is here. He wields a flame-bladed bloodstone longsword in his left hand.
