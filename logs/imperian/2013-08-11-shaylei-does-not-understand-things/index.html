Improper use of the market channel, and harassment of Shaylei. There was no reason for her so say anything about Shaylei, as Shaylei has not done anything to Linslet other then asking why she attacked with Auviryst the month prior. (Market): Linslet says, "Not to mention the privilege of dealing with Shaylei as a minister in your city! That&#39;s a rousing reason to join if I ever saw one." HELP MARKET.

I don&#39;t even know where to start here.  Tavion advertised for people to join Kinsarmar.  I advertised a reason that some people may take issue with (haha!).  This is an ingame issue for which no in game resolution was sought.  She could have done any number of things with the slight against her character.  We&#39;re of equal might, she could have easily used this as valid PK reason or filed an assassination job or anything, really.  The issue cannon she has on a hair trigger is a bit superfluous in this case.  As for "having no reason to insult Shaylei," her character&#39;s reputation does preceed her whether she likes it or not, and other characters can form opinions of hers completely independant of Shaylei&#39;s imput.  This is called "roleplaying" and it&#39;s something the game is based around.


You tell Druidess of War, Shaylei Eldunari, Dreamstalker, "You have no idea how hard I - and everyone else - laughs at you for these issues, do you?"

Shaylei tells you, "//excuse me? Issues are OOC therefore if you have nothing to say IC please refrain from using such terms. Thank you."

You tell Druidess of War, Shaylei Eldunari, Dreamstalker, "And you sought zero in game resolution before firing your issue cannon for a market response. What&#39;s your point?"

Shaylei tells you, "You used the market improperly, there was no need for IC resolution."

Shaylei tells you, "//Linslet also had no reason to verbally attack Shaylei, as she has said nothing to Linslet, nor about Linslet."

You tell Druidess of War, Shaylei Eldunari, Dreamstalker, "//Shaylei has a horrible reputation everywhere, and surprise surprise, people talk about you. Linslet doesn&#39;t need to talk to shaylei to have a reason to hate her skanky ass."

Shaylei tells you, "// just because people talk does not make the talk true. Shaylei has not done anything that would classify her as.... "skanky" since she was 20 years old. She is 80 now. Time for people to grow up and move on."

Shaylei tells you, "// Katalina emoted on CT, yet nearly all of Stavenn and Khandava run to her aide when she calls for it. Much of a double standard? I think so."

You tell Druidess of War, Shaylei Eldunari, Dreamstalker, "//It doesn&#39;t need to be true for a character in the game to act upon it, you silly person. The fact that a character in the game said something to Lins and Lins acts on this information is an IN GAME THING, and so is market. My telling people a reason to not join Kinsarmar in response to another person&#39;s market tell encouraging that is a commerce issue. He&#39;s advertising for, I&#39;m advertising against. And, the difference between you and Katalina is that she&#39;s a useful player and not someone who has superfluous issues on a hair trigger."

Shaylei tells you, "// That is fine, but you were not selling nor seeking goods or services. Therefore the Market tell was not acceptable. And I really don&#39;t care about issues. I am just sick of the continued harassment of Shaylei by people like you, who would rather believe a lie then seek the truth."

You tell Druidess of War, Shaylei Eldunari, Dreamstalker, "Neither was Tavion. Are you issuing him now?"

Shaylei tells you, "He was looking for people to Join Kinsamrar, therefor a good, as in new citymates."

Shaylei tells you, "Had you added a disclaimer of "Join the Empire" or something to that effect, we would not be having this conversation."

Shaylei tells you, "I have had my market abilities taken away for much less then what you just did to be fair."

You tell Druidess of War, Shaylei Eldunari, Dreamstalker, "By that argument, I was providing a service. Telling people that Shaylei is a minister, which some may take issue with (ha!)."

Shaylei tells you, "// then again there was unwarrented hostility against a character that Linslet has never had any interaction with other then shardfall battles."

At this point, I just started ignoring her.'>Issue #103293 Reported by: Shaylei Re: Linslet
