A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena walls to the southwest. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana. He is surrounded by a glowing white nimbus.
You see exits leading east, south, southwest, and northwest.

As you reach out towards Ageranu, he turns to face you, eyes glowing ominously. You gasp and recoil as two radiant arcs of white lightning dart forth from them, and scream as you feel your entire body enveloped in a terrible burning heat which seems to come from deep within you. Writhing in agony, you feel your blood and skin begin to boil before unconsciousness envelops you.

You are OUT of the Manhunt!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
There are 2 beehives here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A lean coyote prowls around the forest, his nose sniffing along the ground for prey.
You see a single exit leading down.
You end your concentration on carving out the heart of your hated foe.
Ageranu stands triumphant, the winner of the Manhunt in the Coliseum.
Engulfed in red flames, Ageranu rushes in from the ether.">Ageranu bows his head in silent prayer.Ageranu IS USING DELIVERANCE
