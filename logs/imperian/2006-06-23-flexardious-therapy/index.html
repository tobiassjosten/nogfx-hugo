Insinyan utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

You say, "Warm blood floating down the streets, screams of agany filling the 
air."

You drift away from the conversation, lost in your daydreams.

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "I have never been turned on by the death of another 
person...vega do you mylest corpses?"

(Saboteurs): Vega says, "I&#39;ve been celibate for.....let&#39;s see."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Pledged his penis to Lord Malkav -runs-."

"Grrrrrr," you say to Matty.

(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Or is it 24?"

You see the following people here:
Insinyan, Matty, Indoum

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "I tease Vega with that."

 Thanatos."

Insinyan utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

"Eh?" you say curiously.

You say, "Cute.."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "No god will ever get my 
 genitalia."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "I need these."

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Wouldn&#39;t marry me cause she 
 wanted to marry Thanatos."

Insinyan grabs protectively at himself.

Matty nods his head at Insinyan, showing his acceptance.

(Saboteurs): You say, "How about you.. Insinyan, surely you have slain someone?"

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Thats probably why it was orgasmic, you don&#39;t remind 
 the last time you had one -sparkle-."

(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Yay Kabal died!"

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I&#39;ll stop now, i promise."

(Saboteurs): Vega says, "*thwaps Matty*."

 parties, at special events, I celibate all the time."

(Saboteurs): Vega says, "*snickers*."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Yeah I have killed a few different people a few 
 different times."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-rofl-."

(Saboteurs): You say, "I think it&#39;s great that He celibates, keeps Him focused."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Tell us, how did it feel?"

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Domini indoum, the guild shrink."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Ohh, shrink."

(Saboteurs): Vega says, "He doesn&#39;t want to say orgasmic."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Don&#39;t make me pronounce the whole thing."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*giggles*."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Yes just good."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Like, a warm feeling?"

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "She said the O word again."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Sure."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Eep, o-word."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "I surely did not release my seed upon them though."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you, Insinyan."

You chuckle long and heartily.

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Just did not happen."

(Shades): Insinyan says, "Greet psyther, everything still going well?"

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "The O thing is kinda cute, but the seed thing is a 
 little too much for me."

(Shades): Psyther says, "Yes, everything is fine thank you."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "To much? whats that?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Don&#39;t mind them, they&#39;re slaves to the Flesh."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Tell us, how did your first feel like?"

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Don&#39;t listen to Indoum, a celibate life is a life 
 half-lived."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Well there was alot of yelling 
 and sweating...and some scratching..."

Insinyan looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.

Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.

"Ewwwwwww!" you say in disgust.

Insinyan clears his throat.

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "And then...umm.. the swords came
in."

Matty reaches over and spanks Insinyan firmly on his bum.

Insinyan gives himself an acknowledging nod.

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "....orgy."

You grin and nod at Insinyan.

Matty coughs softly.

Insinyan almost shudders with disgust, and says "Ick."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "To much sausage in here."

Insinyan shakes his head.

(Saboteurs): You say, "Saadyia?"

You give a mischievous grin.

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Oh. *blushes* Was starting to get nervous."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-thwaps indoum-."

(Saboteurs): You say, "I&#39;d never ask for a description of such a foul act."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "There are first times for many things and knowing my
mind, it&#39;s always good to clarify for me."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Then speak, on your first kill."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "We&#39;re all friends here."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*coughs* Thanks Matty."

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Its like some kinda therapy."

You grin and nod.

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Hello and welcome to 
bloodbath&#39;s with Indoum."

Matty rolls on the floor in front of you, laughing.

You chuckle long and heartily.

You yawn suddenly and mightily.

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "So many funny things to say... 
so many ways to cross the line... Im just going to shut up."

Insinyan shakes his head at himself.

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Go for it."

Matty grins mischievously.

"Good!" you enthuse at Insinyan.

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "I feel as though I&#39;ve lived seemingly lifetimes in 
this realm so it&#39;s hard to remember my first kill. I&#39;ve never been a figher so I
suppose I felt surprised that I actually did something right for a change."

Insinyan utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

You give a mischievous grin.

(Saboteurs): You say, "Then tell us how you felt when you took the life of the 
first person you remember."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "This is so twisted."

You say, "How so?"

Insinyan utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "It just is."

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "This is how Indoum gets his 
kicks."

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Now hes celibate."

You say, "Quite the opposit."

Insinyan snickers softly to himself.

You say, "From what Insinyan said."

You say, "Twisted would be to keep these feelings all to yourself."

You say, "It&#39;s beutiful, why keep it for yourself?!"

Insinyan snickers softly to himself.

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality asks, "Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex 
did i mention, sex?"

Insinyan nods his head at Matty, showing his acceptance.

(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Does anyone have a toxicologist satchel that I made?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Please, we&#39;re having a moment here."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "There was a little warm glow of satisfaction I 
suppose. Knowing that others linked with Lord Thanatos in the realm could see 
that it was me that killed another. It&#39;s not a big deal for regular fighters, 
but for me it was a nice way to be recognized. This realm seems to almost 
idolize killers."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-thwap indoum-."

Insinyan sniffles softly.

(Saboteurs): You say, "Ohh, I see."

Matty jumps up in the air and shouts, "WOO!"

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Die fucker die."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Yet no one likes pookie...why?"

Matty coughs softly.

(Saboteurs): You say, "So it was the recognition that made your day?"

Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Pookie?"

Insinyan cackles hellishly.

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Dregaur."

Comprehension flashes across Matty&#39;s face.

(Congregation): Elizabell says, "Greetings."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Everytime I honours adonis I 
laugh my ass off."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "His warcry is classic."

Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Yes. For that one moment feeling that I was a part 
of what a good portion of this realm respects."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you for sharing, Saadyia."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*bows*."

Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Im going to go spank people, see
you bolth in a little while."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Now, a round of applause for Saadyia."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Domini Matty, your turn!"

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I felt the urge to boogie, real hard. -boogies-."

You say to Insinyan, "Have fun."

Matty waves goodbye at Insinyan.

(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Huzzah!"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Go figure.."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I mean, more than usual of course."

(Saboteurs): You say, "So.. Hapiness then?"

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Do I need an appointment for next week to discuss 
any childhood reasons why I&#39;m so menetally disturbed, Domini?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "No, I think we all know why. -grin-."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I&#39;m old, i don&#39;t remember my first kill. I think it 
was an arb in his grove with my bow, managed to get him with a cyanide arrow 
while the cage went down, i felt overwhelmed with the urge to boogie."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-rofl-."

(Saboteurs): You say, "That&#39;s a great first kill!"

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Did you boogie extra hard domini?"

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I boogied for his poor soul, wait i&#39;m lying."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Was it the way you killed him or her that made you happy,
or your hatred for him/her..?"

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Aye, it amused me that in his sanctuary he was still 
vulnerable."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Alright. Thank you, Domini."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Averas, I believe you&#39;re next."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Though his name escapes me."

(Saboteurs): You say, "They&#39;re all the same.."

(Saboteurs): Averas says, "I haven&#39;t killed anyone other than the villagers in 
Transk thus far."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Don&#39;t forget to boogie, once you do."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Whilst not the same, do tell us how that felt."

(Saboteurs): You say, "The moment you were made aware that you&#39;d cut their link 
to this realm off for good."

(Saboteurs): Averas says, "Hmmmm."

(Saboteurs): You say, "How did it make you feel?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Averas?"

(Saboteurs): Averas says, "One sec."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Ofcourse."

(Saboteurs): Averas says, "Well, I was being paid to kill them, I was just 
pleased at the opportunity to practice my skills, while at the same time being 
paid for it."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Yes, how but did it Feel?"

(Saboteurs): Averas says, "Intense and invigorating."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Excellent."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you all, this night turned out alright after all."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "You never did ask me."

(Saboteurs): You say, "I did."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-rofl-."

(Saboteurs): You say, "But do you want to add?"

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "My first kill was sorrl, I was a passivist for 
years until he attacked me over and over again. Finally he came at me to get 
aneasy kill when I was un-ready with a lady friend of mine, but I was actually 
ready and I stomped the hell out of him. He tried again and again got stomped 
and I never saw him again."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "The name rings a bell."

(Saboteurs): You say, "I hear the ringing too."

(Saboteurs): You say, "It felt good, I asume?

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Cuckoo cuckoo."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Yeah. He had tried hurting my son and family and 
was just an all around crazy bastard. Felt wonderful."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Warm and fuzzy?"

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "May I add something?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Ofcourse, just let Insinyan finish."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*nods*."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Sounds as if he is finished. Go ahead, Saadyia."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "No, he&#39;s probably writing a huge paragraph that none
of us wants to be in the middle of a battle when he throws it up.""

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Im done."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Hehe."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Really? Wow."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Well, I&#39;d like to think that realizing you have 
control over life and death when choosing to kill someone is power. I think it&#39;s
that power we all enjoy when we talk about killing for the first time. Some 
people like Dregaur and Juganothion use that power to throw fear into people. 
Power over life and death is the ultimately the closest thing to being an 
Immortal we&#39;ll ever become."

(Saboteurs): You say, "I love what I&#39;m hearing, Domna."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "The power to kill someone for revenge, the power 
to kill to protect. The power to make people bow down and do things for you if 
you want to use it that way. *shrugs* That&#39;s just my feeling anyway."

(Saboteurs): You say, "However.. That&#39;s just one aspect of cutting the link."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Killing someone can be used as a tool, an opinion I 
respect. Others see death as a goal."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Ahh, Arlith."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "True. It&#39;s all a matter of perspective."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Hm?"

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Oh, I apologize, greetings everybody."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Even you must have managed to slay someone, sometime? 
Tell us how you felt, will you?"

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "I manage to slay people more than enough, thank you."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Yes, but the first time. Do you remember that?"

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, ".. The first time I ever fought and killed somebody?"

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Matty says, "Rofl, so evil Domini."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "Thanks!"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Aye."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Or rather, the first time you killed someone. Fighting 
isn&#39;t a requisit."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "It was to avenge my guildmistress, for the 
Lorekeepers. I beheaded Chasmina and before I did I smiled. I enjoy killing, but
typically I try to detach myself from emotions when I do so."

(Saboteurs): You say, "You smiled.. Because you were happy?"

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "When you grow to enjoy liking to use your weapons, 
your tools of trade, you slowly seep into a state that the common people could 
label &#39;a monster&#39;."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "I was happy I was able to kill a traitor, as ironic 
as that sounds with all of my past incidents."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "You sure thats cause of your killing skills? -tease-."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Heh."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Happy.."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you, Arlith, for sharing."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Greetings."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Hail, Addum!"

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Greetings Addum."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Just in time.. You&#39;re up!"

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Yep, Addum is next."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Eh?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "I&#39;m leading a group therapy here, and we all like to know
now about your first kill."

(Saboteurs): You say, "How did it make you feel?"

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, ".. Group therapy?"

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "My first kill? Heh."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Wow, Nisha is going to crack up when she hears I&#39;m 
getting therapy."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Aye, who it was doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all about the 
feeling."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Hmm...probably shouldn&#39;t go there then."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "I&#39;ll listen though."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Oh come on, I shared."

(Saboteurs): You say, "We&#39;ve all spoken."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Trust me, we&#39;ve even heard the O word from Vega."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "We had a moment with this conversation."

(Saboteurs): Aelastidru says, "Did I miss something?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Saadyia, don&#39;t bring that up.. -eye."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Aelastidru says, "Greetings everyone."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Ahh, Aelastidru."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Sorry..."

(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "It involved a dangerous linking of death and sexual
activity that made you want to throw up and laugh until you throw up at the same
time."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Very well. Aelastidru, you&#39;re up then."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "It made me blush even."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "As much blood as I splash around when I slit a 
throat, Insinyan, that mental image is disgusting."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Orgasmic?"

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*twiches*."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "We&#39;re not in the dark ages peoples -snicker-."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "I feel Cyth would of made a better slave than a 
pikedhead in the storeroom. I think he was my first kill, although I doubt it 
since I&#39;m sure I killed some other random people in my day, but I&#39;m too old to 
remember."

(Saboteurs): Aelastidru says, "Almost as much blood as you splashed around while
forester, Arlith?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Then, Addum, tell of the first one you do remember?"

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Heh."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "The most satisfying would probably make for a better 
story, and that would be Cyth, just because he doens&#39;t think before he acts and 
I find it funny."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Go on, tell us of your feelings when you were made 
awarethat you had indeed turned out his lights."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Wow, that&#39;s an eloquent way of saying he bit the 
dust."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Makai is here too, just as we were running out of 
subjects. Excellent."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Ah, I was going to go into the battle itself, for that
is where the purpose is. The way he died matters very little, but how he fights 
before death. Anyways, I didn&#39;t realize he was dead at first. I was too 
concerned with putting more linseed in my pipe that I didn&#39;t bother checking for
a pulse, I assumed ciguatoxin had him at first."

(Saboteurs): You say, "And then?"

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Hail brethern."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "What? I killed him and then went back to ogre 
hunting."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "He wants to know how you felt when you killed him."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Yes but how did this make you feel?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "That&#39;s it? No fuzzy feelings? No disgust? No amazement?"

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Who killed who."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Eijin, take a seat and listen."

(Saboteurs): You say, "We&#39;re having a moment together."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Oh, like I said, no real feelings. Had a job to do, so
I did it and moved on. Satisfaction I guess, since I survived."

(Saboteurs): You say, "I see.."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you, Addum, for sharing."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Glad to see so many about now, its nice. Shade Psyther
still needs to change names though..."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Dissapointment he didn&#39;t last longer too, i would 
imagine."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Matty says, "Gotta catch em all!"

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Rynok says, "Heh."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Aelastidru says, "Heh."

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "I&#39;m still confused."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Rynok says, "I&#39;m waiting for another form of spelling for 
&#39;psyther&#39;"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Aelastidru, you&#39;re next."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "He was faster than an ogre, which was kind of funny, I
had actually expected more, but oh well."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Anyone ever been to the Kobold village before?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Guess he&#39;s floating.."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Makai, I believe you&#39;d make an excellent next 
contribution to this."

(Saboteurs): You say, "All floaters.. Eijin?"

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "I dont even know what we are talking about."

(Saboteurs): You say, "The feeling you had when you first killed another."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Feeling being the key word."

(Saboteurs): Makai says, "Eijin? Triumph that they didn&#39;t PORTALS away before he
got them."

(Saboteurs): You say, "While I like the insult, whom it was is of no 
importance."

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Superior, that I could kill without breaking a 
sweat,thats what I thought when I finished my first kill."

(Saboteurs): You say, "A feeling of strength then?"

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Sure."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Alright, similar to Domna Saadyia then."

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "But I feel new things with the different people I 
kill."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Is there any Pattern in it?"

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Depends on the kind of fight they put up, I feel 
nothing with they die too quickly, and give no fight, like when I killed 
Dathanand Gelf in a Team, I felt nothing because together niether of them had no
skill."

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "And then when I kill someone who is cocky I makings me
feel righteous as if I&#39;m doing the Realm a favor of silencing this person."

(Saboteurs): You say, "So, you see their departure only as a success of your 
fight?"

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Not really, its more of me teaching, and any death I 
recieve is just a Lesson for me to understand."

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "When you kill some one they unless a complete fool 
will learn from it."

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "They well learn from it I mean."

(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Sorry."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Interesting, really."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you, Eijin, for sharing."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Makai, Aelastidru.. Either of you feel like 
contributing?"

(Saboteurs): Aelastidru says, "I agree?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "To?"

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Aelastidru says, "Bleh ok. what are we talking about. I&#39;ve been 
making ghelp files."

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "The feeling you got from your first kill."

(Saboteurs): Aelastidru says, "Methodical."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Elaborate."

(Saboteurs): You say, "A floater.. Very well."

(Saboteurs): You say, "Dagnimaer, you feel like Sharing?"

(Saboteurs): You say, "Guess not. Thank you all who participated, it&#39;s been 
flexardious."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, ".. What a display of vocabulary."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Is that a good thing...?"

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "I suppose."

(Saboteurs): Makai says, "The entire point of the discussion was so he could use
that word."

(Saboteurs): You say, "It&#39;s very good."

(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Heh, Makai."

(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*laughs* Probably."

(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Heh, saving it up."

(Saboteurs): You say, "I&#39;m revealed.."

(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-rofl-."'>(Saboteurs): You say, "Genocide.."
You cough softly.
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Eh?"
Insinyan tilts his head curiously at you.
(Saboteurs): You say, "Err, thinking out loud."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Cuckoo."
Insinyan rolls on the floor, laughing.
You grin mischievously at Matty.
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "You day dream about genocide?"
You shrug helplessly.
Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.
You say, "Don't we all?"
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality sticks out his tongue and says,
"Thats an assassin for ya."
Insinyan rolls his eyes.
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Not me."
Insinyan utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
You say, "Warm blood floating down the streets, screams of agany filling the
air."
You drift away from the conversation, lost in your daydreams.
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says to Matty, "He needs a girl
friend."
Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.
Insinyan nods sagely.
"Yuuucckk!" you say, wrinkling your nose in revulsion.
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says to you, "Do you enjoy men?"
Insinyan tilts his head curiously at you.
You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.
Unable to restrain himself, Insinyan begins laughing out loud.
Matty gives you a long snog.
Insinyan almost shudders with disgust, and says "Ick."
Insinyan shakes his head.
Comprehension flashes across your face.
Matty strokes a small black cobra tenderly.
You take a seat on an inviting leather sofa.
(Saboteurs): You say, "We've all slain someone, haven't we?"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Me never, my hands are clean."
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Stavros."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Tell me.. How was it like, the first time?"
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "*flex*."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-remembers when Vega killed Cander- -daydream-."
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "That was HILARIOUS."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Saadyia says, "Surprising that I could actually do it."
Insinyan looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
(Saboteurs): You say, "Do what, Domna?"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "You totally weren't expecting it, was funny."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Made me want trioxin so bad -grin-."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Oooh I killed Cander with trioxin."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Yup."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "It was great."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): You say, "Come now, tell me how it -felt- like."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
It is the 10th day of Tenebrae, in the year 462 AD.
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "It felt.....hrm."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): You say, "Vega's first."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;

H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;

H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;

H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "... what to say... what to do."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;

H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): You say, "Not at all. I'm disgusted, but intrigued at the same
time."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I'm excited -cough-."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;

H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "-rofl-."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "You can't tell me you've never been excited to the
point of arousal over killing someone."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;

(Saboteurs): You say, "Orgasms are usualy bound to sexual acts, and those
disgusts me."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Indoum is celibate."
H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;

H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;

H:220 M:247 E:1314 W:1521 &amp;lt;eb p&amp;gt;
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "I have never been turned on by the death of another
person...vega do you mylest corpses?"
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "I've been celibate for.....let's see."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Pledged his penis to Lord Malkav -runs-."
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "25 years now."
"Grrrrrr," you say to Matty.
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Or is it 24?"
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Meh."
You see the following people here:
Insinyan, Matty, Indoum
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "I tease Vega with that."
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "She pledged her vagina to
Thanatos."
Insinyan utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
"Eh?" you say curiously.
You say, "Cute.."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "No god will ever get my
genitalia."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "I need these."
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Wouldn't marry me cause she
wanted to marry Thanatos."
Insinyan grabs protectively at himself.
Matty nods his head at Insinyan, showing his acceptance.
(Saboteurs): You say, "How about you.. Insinyan, surely you have slain someone?"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Thats probably why it was orgasmic, you don't remind
the last time you had one -sparkle-."
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Yay Kabal died!"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I'll stop now, i promise."
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "*thwaps Matty*."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "Good. -grin-."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Matty says, "Pishposh."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "I think its good that he celibates. I celibate at
parties, at special events, I celibate all the time."
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "*snickers*."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Yeah I have killed a few different people a few
different times."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-rofl-."
(Saboteurs): You say, "I think it's great that He celibates, keeps Him focused."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Tell us, how did it feel?"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Domini indoum, the guild shrink."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Felt good of course, the person deserved it and it
was in a moment of kil or be killed."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Shrink..?"
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "I was just about to comment."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Good, just good?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Ohh, shrink."
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "He doesn't want to say orgasmic."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Don't make me pronounce the whole thing."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*giggles*."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Yes just good."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Like, a warm feeling?"
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "She said the O word again."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Sure."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Eep, o-word."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "I surely did not release my seed upon them though."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you, Insinyan."
You chuckle long and heartily.
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Just did not happen."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "..."
Insinyan rolls on the floor, laughing.
(Saboteurs): You say, "Saadyia, you're up!"
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Well neither did I, you goof."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Not what cander said -duck-."
Insinyan rolls on the floor, laughing.
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*blushes* oookay...time for me to be embarrassed."
(Shades): Psyther says, "Greetings fellow Saboteurs."
(Shades): You say, "Tidings, Shade."
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Should i like, be preparing
my answer?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Embarrassed?"
Matty purses his lips contemplatively.
You put your hands on your hips and say "Huh?" to Matty.
(Shades): Insinyan says, "Greet psyther, everything still going well?"
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "The O thing is kinda cute, but the seed thing is a
little too much for me."
(Shades): Psyther says, "Yes, everything is fine thank you."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "To much? whats that?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Don't mind them, they're slaves to the Flesh."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Tell us, how did your first feel like?"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Don't listen to Indoum, a celibate life is a life
half-lived."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Well there was alot of yelling
and sweating...and some scratching..."
Insinyan looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.
Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.
"Ewwwwwww!" you say in disgust.
Insinyan clears his throat.
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "And then...umm.. the swords came
in."
Matty reaches over and spanks Insinyan firmly on his bum.
Insinyan gives himself an acknowledging nod.
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "....orgy."
You grin and nod at Insinyan.
Matty coughs softly.
Insinyan almost shudders with disgust, and says "Ick."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "To much sausage in here."
Insinyan shakes his head.
(Saboteurs): You say, "Saadyia?"
Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Yes, Domini?"
Unable to restrain himself, Insinyan begins laughing out loud.
(Saboteurs): You say, "Hrm.. You're as orange as me sometimes. Tell of your
first time?"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "First time killing."
Unable to restrain himself, Insinyan begins laughing out loud.
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Not the o-word thing."
Insinyan rolls on the floor, laughing.
You give a mischievous grin.
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Oh. *blushes* Was starting to get nervous."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-thwaps indoum-."
(Saboteurs): You say, "I'd never ask for a description of such a foul act."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "There are first times for many things and knowing my
mind, it's always good to clarify for me."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Then speak, on your first kill."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "We're all friends here."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*coughs* Thanks Matty."
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Its like some kinda therapy."
You grin and nod.
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Hello and welcome to
bloodbath's with Indoum."
Matty rolls on the floor in front of you, laughing.
You chuckle long and heartily.
You yawn suddenly and mightily.
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "So many funny things to say...
so many ways to cross the line... Im just going to shut up."
Insinyan shakes his head at himself.
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Go for it."
Matty grins mischievously.
"Good!" you enthuse at Insinyan.
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "I feel as though I've lived seemingly lifetimes in
this realm so it's hard to remember my first kill. I've never been a figher so I
suppose I felt surprised that I actually did something right for a change."
Insinyan utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
You give a mischievous grin.
(Saboteurs): You say, "Then tell us how you felt when you took the life of the
first person you remember."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "This is so twisted."
You say, "How so?"
Insinyan utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "It just is."
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "This is how Indoum gets his
kicks."
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Now hes celibate."
You say, "Quite the opposit."
Insinyan snickers softly to himself.
You say, "From what Insinyan said."
You say, "Twisted would be to keep these feelings all to yourself."
You say, "It's beutiful, why keep it for yourself?!"
Insinyan snickers softly to himself.
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality asks, "Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
did i mention, sex?"
Insinyan nods his head at Matty, showing his acceptance.
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Does anyone have a toxicologist satchel that I made?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Please, we're having a moment here."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "There was a little warm glow of satisfaction I
suppose. Knowing that others linked with Lord Thanatos in the realm could see
that it was me that killed another. It's not a big deal for regular fighters,
but for me it was a nice way to be recognized. This realm seems to almost
idolize killers."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-thwap indoum-."
Insinyan sniffles softly.
(Saboteurs): You say, "Ohh, I see."
Matty jumps up in the air and shouts, "WOO!"
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Die fucker die."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Yet no one likes pookie...why?"
Matty coughs softly.
(Saboteurs): You say, "So it was the recognition that made your day?"
Grand Archon Matty Faris, Weaver of Reality says, "Pookie?"
Insinyan cackles hellishly.
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Dregaur."
Comprehension flashes across Matty's face.
(Congregation): Elizabell says, "Greetings."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Everytime I honours adonis I
laugh my ass off."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "His warcry is classic."
Matty rolls on the floor, laughing.
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Yes. For that one moment feeling that I was a part
of what a good portion of this realm respects."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you for sharing, Saadyia."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*bows*."
Dicae Insinyan Virs Master of the Boogie says, "Im going to go spank people, see
you bolth in a little while."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Now, a round of applause for Saadyia."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Domini Matty, your turn!"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I felt the urge to boogie, real hard. -boogies-."
You say to Insinyan, "Have fun."
Matty waves goodbye at Insinyan.
(Saboteurs): Vega says, "Huzzah!"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Go figure.."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I mean, more than usual of course."
(Saboteurs): You say, "So.. Hapiness then?"
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Do I need an appointment for next week to discuss
any childhood reasons why I'm so menetally disturbed, Domini?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "No, I think we all know why. -grin-."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I'm old, i don't remember my first kill. I think it
was an arb in his grove with my bow, managed to get him with a cyanide arrow
while the cage went down, i felt overwhelmed with the urge to boogie."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-rofl-."
(Saboteurs): You say, "That's a great first kill!"
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Did you boogie extra hard domini?"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "I boogied for his poor soul, wait i'm lying."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Was it the way you killed him or her that made you happy,
or your hatred for him/her..?"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Aye, it amused me that in his sanctuary he was still
vulnerable."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Alright. Thank you, Domini."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Averas, I believe you're next."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Though his name escapes me."
(Saboteurs): You say, "They're all the same.."
(Saboteurs): Averas says, "I haven't killed anyone other than the villagers in
Transk thus far."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Don't forget to boogie, once you do."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Whilst not the same, do tell us how that felt."
(Saboteurs): You say, "The moment you were made aware that you'd cut their link
to this realm off for good."
(Saboteurs): Averas says, "Hmmmm."
(Saboteurs): You say, "How did it make you feel?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Averas?"
(Saboteurs): Averas says, "One sec."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Ofcourse."
(Saboteurs): Averas says, "Well, I was being paid to kill them, I was just
pleased at the opportunity to practice my skills, while at the same time being
paid for it."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Yes, how but did it Feel?"
(Saboteurs): Averas says, "Intense and invigorating."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Excellent."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you all, this night turned out alright after all."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "You never did ask me."
(Saboteurs): You say, "I did."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-rofl-."
(Saboteurs): You say, "But do you want to add?"
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "My first kill was sorrl, I was a passivist for
years until he attacked me over and over again. Finally he came at me to get
aneasy kill when I was un-ready with a lady friend of mine, but I was actually
ready and I stomped the hell out of him. He tried again and again got stomped
and I never saw him again."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "The name rings a bell."
(Saboteurs): You say, "I hear the ringing too."
(Saboteurs): You say, "It felt good, I asume?
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Cuckoo cuckoo."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Yeah. He had tried hurting my son and family and
was just an all around crazy bastard. Felt wonderful."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Warm and fuzzy?"
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "May I add something?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Ofcourse, just let Insinyan finish."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*nods*."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Sounds as if he is finished. Go ahead, Saadyia."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "No, he's probably writing a huge paragraph that none
of us wants to be in the middle of a battle when he throws it up.""
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Im done."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "Hehe."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Really? Wow."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Well, I'd like to think that realizing you have
control over life and death when choosing to kill someone is power. I think it's
that power we all enjoy when we talk about killing for the first time. Some
people like Dregaur and Juganothion use that power to throw fear into people.
Power over life and death is the ultimately the closest thing to being an
Immortal we'll ever become."
(Saboteurs): You say, "I love what I'm hearing, Domna."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "The power to kill someone for revenge, the power
to kill to protect. The power to make people bow down and do things for you if
you want to use it that way. *shrugs* That's just my feeling anyway."
(Saboteurs): You say, "However.. That's just one aspect of cutting the link."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Killing someone can be used as a tool, an opinion I
respect. Others see death as a goal."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Ahh, Arlith."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "True. It's all a matter of perspective."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Hm?"
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Oh, I apologize, greetings everybody."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Even you must have managed to slay someone, sometime?
Tell us how you felt, will you?"
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "I manage to slay people more than enough, thank you."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Yes, but the first time. Do you remember that?"
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, ".. The first time I ever fought and killed somebody?"
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Matty says, "Rofl, so evil Domini."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "Thanks!"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Aye."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Or rather, the first time you killed someone. Fighting
isn't a requisit."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "It was to avenge my guildmistress, for the
Lorekeepers. I beheaded Chasmina and before I did I smiled. I enjoy killing, but
typically I try to detach myself from emotions when I do so."
(Saboteurs): You say, "You smiled.. Because you were happy?"
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "When you grow to enjoy liking to use your weapons,
your tools of trade, you slowly seep into a state that the common people could
label 'a monster'."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "I was happy I was able to kill a traitor, as ironic
as that sounds with all of my past incidents."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "You sure thats cause of your killing skills? -tease-."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Heh."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Happy.."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you, Arlith, for sharing."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Greetings."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Hail, Addum!"
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Greetings Addum."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Just in time.. You're up!"
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Yep, Addum is next."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Eh?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "I'm leading a group therapy here, and we all like to know
now about your first kill."
(Saboteurs): You say, "How did it make you feel?"
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, ".. Group therapy?"
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "My first kill? Heh."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Wow, Nisha is going to crack up when she hears I'm
getting therapy."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Aye, who it was doesn't matter. It's all about the
feeling."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Hmm...probably shouldn't go there then."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "I'll listen though."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Oh come on, I shared."
(Saboteurs): You say, "We've all spoken."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Trust me, we've even heard the O word from Vega."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "We had a moment with this conversation."
(Saboteurs): Aelastidru says, "Did I miss something?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Saadyia, don't bring that up.. -eye."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Aelastidru says, "Greetings everyone."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Ahh, Aelastidru."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Sorry..."
(Saboteurs): Insinyan says, "It involved a dangerous linking of death and sexual
activity that made you want to throw up and laugh until you throw up at the same
time."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Very well. Aelastidru, you're up then."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "It made me blush even."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "As much blood as I splash around when I slit a
throat, Insinyan, that mental image is disgusting."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Orgasmic?"
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*twiches*."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "We're not in the dark ages peoples -snicker-."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "I feel Cyth would of made a better slave than a
pikedhead in the storeroom. I think he was my first kill, although I doubt it
since I'm sure I killed some other random people in my day, but I'm too old to
remember."
(Saboteurs): Aelastidru says, "Almost as much blood as you splashed around while
forester, Arlith?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Then, Addum, tell of the first one you do remember?"
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Heh."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "The most satisfying would probably make for a better
story, and that would be Cyth, just because he doens't think before he acts and
I find it funny."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Go on, tell us of your feelings when you were made
awarethat you had indeed turned out his lights."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Wow, that's an eloquent way of saying he bit the
dust."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Makai is here too, just as we were running out of
subjects. Excellent."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Ah, I was going to go into the battle itself, for that
is where the purpose is. The way he died matters very little, but how he fights
before death. Anyways, I didn't realize he was dead at first. I was too
concerned with putting more linseed in my pipe that I didn't bother checking for
a pulse, I assumed ciguatoxin had him at first."
(Saboteurs): You say, "And then?"
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Hail brethern."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "What? I killed him and then went back to ogre
hunting."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "He wants to know how you felt when you killed him."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Yes but how did this make you feel?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "That's it? No fuzzy feelings? No disgust? No amazement?"
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Who killed who."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Eijin, take a seat and listen."
(Saboteurs): You say, "We're having a moment together."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Oh, like I said, no real feelings. Had a job to do, so
I did it and moved on. Satisfaction I guess, since I survived."
(Saboteurs): You say, "I see.."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you, Addum, for sharing."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Glad to see so many about now, its nice. Shade Psyther
still needs to change names though..."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "Dissapointment he didn't last longer too, i would
imagine."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Matty says, "Gotta catch em all!"
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Rynok says, "Heh."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Aelastidru says, "Heh."
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "I'm still confused."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Rynok says, "I'm waiting for another form of spelling for
'psyther'"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Aelastidru, you're next."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "He was faster than an ogre, which was kind of funny, I
had actually expected more, but oh well."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Anyone ever been to the Kobold village before?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Guess he's floating.."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Makai, I believe you'd make an excellent next
contribution to this."
(Saboteurs): You say, "All floaters.. Eijin?"
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "I dont even know what we are talking about."
(Saboteurs): You say, "The feeling you had when you first killed another."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Feeling being the key word."
(Saboteurs): Makai says, "Eijin? Triumph that they didn't PORTALS away before he
got them."
(Saboteurs): You say, "While I like the insult, whom it was is of no
importance."
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Superior, that I could kill without breaking a
sweat,thats what I thought when I finished my first kill."
(Saboteurs): You say, "A feeling of strength then?"
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Sure."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Alright, similar to Domna Saadyia then."
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "But I feel new things with the different people I
kill."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Is there any Pattern in it?"
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Depends on the kind of fight they put up, I feel
nothing with they die too quickly, and give no fight, like when I killed
Dathanand Gelf in a Team, I felt nothing because together niether of them had no
skill."
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "And then when I kill someone who is cocky I makings me
feel righteous as if I'm doing the Realm a favor of silencing this person."
(Saboteurs): You say, "So, you see their departure only as a success of your
fight?"
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Not really, its more of me teaching, and any death I
recieve is just a Lesson for me to understand."
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "When you kill some one they unless a complete fool
will learn from it."
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "They well learn from it I mean."
(Saboteurs): Eijin says, "Sorry."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Interesting, really."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Thank you, Eijin, for sharing."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Makai, Aelastidru.. Either of you feel like
contributing?"
(Saboteurs): Aelastidru says, "I agree?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "To?"
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Aelastidru says, "Bleh ok. what are we talking about. I've been
making ghelp files."
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Saboteurs&amp;gt;&amp;gt;: You say, "The feeling you got from your first kill."
(Saboteurs): Aelastidru says, "Methodical."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Elaborate."
(Saboteurs): You say, "A floater.. Very well."
(Saboteurs): You say, "Dagnimaer, you feel like Sharing?"
(Saboteurs): You say, "Guess not. Thank you all who participated, it's been
flexardious."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, ".. What a display of vocabulary."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "Is that a good thing...?"
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "I suppose."
(Saboteurs): Makai says, "The entire point of the discussion was so he could use
that word."
(Saboteurs): You say, "It's very good."
(Saboteurs): Arlith says, "Heh, Makai."
(Saboteurs): Saadyia says, "*laughs* Probably."
(Saboteurs): Rynok says, "Heh, saving it up."
(Saboteurs): You say, "I'm revealed.."
(Saboteurs): Matty says, "-rofl-."</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
