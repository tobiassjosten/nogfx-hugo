</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "The battle raged for weeks outside of the walls. The sand all around was black from demonic spawn. Yet by some miracle each charge led by our Justicars and clerics drove them back, time after time. Yet it was taking a toll...so many, so weary..."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "The bonfires burned each night. The demons HATED the fire and feared it greatly. Yet on this night a terrible storm was raging in the desert and the fires were very low. The demon forces held back, the sand blasting into them and killing hundreds, scattering countless more. Yet...finally it caused the fires to go out."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "In the face of this storm, many in the city had taken to their homes and the walls had largely been abandoned as it was believed nothing could survive the terrible storm that raged in the desert."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "It proved a terrible mistake. Whipped into frenzy by a demonic Commander, the demon horde attacked in the middle of the storm. Terrible magicks that had not before been seen blasted the walls and finally they breached the city and poured in..."

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale shivers and catches her breath, her skin going pale.
 
</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "I...will not speak to you of the atrocities. There are no words, and the images are not meant to be left in mortal minds. It is enough for you to know, that no enemy you may face in your daily battle will conceive of the...inhumanities...they committed upon those they came upon."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "...but there was no protection save for one heroic warrior wielding a legendary sword and a handful of his most valiant fellow knight. They stood at the doors...and battled wave after wave of nightmarish creatures."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "I do not know if it was days or hours..but eventually their prayer to keep the demons at bay were no longer heeded. They had lost the spiritual energy to muster them. They were cut off from the other troops and out of healing supplies. Only the divine power captured in Kazeem&#39;s sword, Demonsbane, was left to hold the hordes at bay."

Cut down like an animal...no..worse...much worse..and as he had known would happen if he fell, the frenzied demons gained the depths of the temple and the people there..women..children...men...it mattered not. Their horror is still there to be seen if you walk into that cursed room and see what memory of that day is left upon the very stone of the floor."

Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale smiles at you then, as she shows you the rose.
 
</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "It is a promise...and an acknowledgement of the great courage shown in the face of evil. A reminder that there is hope and that he is not forgotten. He walks now in ghostly form..still on watch...but this rose is a pact that one day his patrols will end and he will be taken home to the side of the Gods he served so well. One day, he will be forgiven..if..somehow..he can forgive himself."
