A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Silent and observant, a

raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady 
black eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. 
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Fluttering on

Forest inside the arena walls. (North Eastern Arena.)
A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Silent and observant, a 
red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A 
raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady 
black eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. 
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A sleek black 
hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Manoan Pirate, Traea 
Bharathian is here. Diavlous Initiate Verick Iscariot is here. He wields a 
dwarven battleaxe in each hand.

You inhale deeply, allowing the raging flames to build up inside you. With an 
earth-shaking roar, you release a white-hot jet of fire directly at Verick.
With an instinctive gesture of self-preservation, Verick raises his arms ahead 
of himself in terror as the jet of white-hot fire shoots towards him through 
the air. The gesture is futile, as the column of flame incinerates poor Verick 
instantly. For a second his charred skeleton stands transfixed before you, then
crumbles to ashes.
You have slain Verick.
Verick leaves to the ether.
=== Enemy left to the: Ether ===">Forest inside the arena walls. (North Eastern Arena.)
A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Silent and observant, a
red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A
raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady
black eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies.
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A sleek black
hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Hands of rotting flesh and
white bone push up from the ground.
You see exits leading north and west.

Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A sleek black

Forest inside the arena walls. (North Eastern Arena.)
A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Silent and observant, a
red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A
raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady
black eyes. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies.
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Fluttering on
delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A sleek black
hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Manoan Pirate, Traea
Bharathian is here.
You see exits leading north and west.

crumbles to ashes.
You have slain Verick.
Verick leaves to the ether.
