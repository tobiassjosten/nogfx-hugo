Subj: Lylian vs Vanmoriel election</p><p>I have put Lylian back into the guild so that the previous election can take place. If you were not eligible to vote previously, you are not allowed to vote in this election. While it is probably not possible, things like inguilding and then favouring people so they can vote, will result in shrubbery. In short, do not favor people or give people who could not previously vote the ability to do so until this election is over.</p><p>I will be reviewing all the votes to make sure nothing is out of the ordinary.</p><p>Penned by my hand on the 9th of Aequitas, in the year 41 AM.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ffb4a131fa163740262c123014e0800?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by laylackip@xxx on 15 Mar 2014</p><p>CRUSADERS NEWS #68

Subj: Guildmaster Election, Round Two</p><p>The rules from this point are whatever your guild has in place and can enforce. We only stepped in and enforced the first election as that was a mess. The game rules in place that we will enforce are:</p><ol><li>No seconds are allowed to vote.</li><li>You cannot kick anyone out of the guild that is voting until after the elections are over.</li></ol><p>If your guild had a no favoring policy, that is your call. Although one side promoting players just to vote for them is pretty lame. Inactive players that return can vote, as long as they meet the coded activity rules for voting. Bringing a second back just to vote and then quitting is pretty stupid too.</p><p>Administration does not normally regulate guildmaster votes and we are not going to start now. We stepped in on this one because of the circumstances.</p><p>Penned by my hand on the 7th of Ferinus, in the year 42 AM.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
