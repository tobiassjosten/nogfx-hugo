Subj: Contention for Erege

To all citizens:

I am Runi Shinohara, a Lorekeeper. For several years I have lived in this city,
and have done my duty to defend it every month of those years.

When our Khandavan brothers stood against us in retaliation of the actions of 
one citizen, I was there to show them that Kinsarmar is not the stagnant pool 
of idiocy that so many believe us to be.

When the cannibalistic savages of Ithaqua made their attempt to raze our 
glorious Duchy to the ground and consume every man, woman and child within, I 
was there to take the fight to their frozen waste of a village.

When the evil-minded zealots of Antioch declared us profane and launched a 
crusade to erase us from their sight I was there to drive them back into the 
hole in the sand from whence they came.

When the dark forces of the Empire of Stavenn broke through our gates; when all
had given up hope; when there was naught but the proud guardsmen of our city to
protect it against the foul, gibbering hordes of demonic madness; writhing and 
twisting in their desire to destroy our freedoms and make us slaves of their 
perverse magicks, I was there to lead the charge against them.

I was the only one who stood to fight that day, defending my home for days, 
when the rest chose to take shelter within the sewers.

This is my line of duty, Kinsarmar, as a Lorekeeper and more importantly, a 
citizen of the Duchy. My duty, and my desire, is to defend the city and its 
subjects from every threat, outside and inside.

Being a citizen of the Duchy, I understand what it is like to live at the 
bottom of the chain of command. I am not a high-brow noble whom lives their 
live in the comfort of a mansion. I am a soldier, one of the proletariat that 
has seen the state of the city at the level that a citizen does.

And as a citizen, I have seen that my efforts to defend the city have been in 
vain. I have bled on the streets only to see people such as Sorin and Dias take
positions of power. I have fought hard and fought strong only to find that 
there are those within the leadership whom denounce my will and desire to 
fight.

The enemies of Kinsarmar exist within the city just as they do without, and 
already, they have struck a deep blow upon the city. Elect me as an Erege and I
will do everything in my power to repair the wounds left by those whom have 
injured our great Duchy with their poor decisions and choices.
