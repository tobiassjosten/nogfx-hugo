Where animals go to die. (Demon's Pass.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A fairly large pile of
golden sovereigns twinkles and gleams. A large beehive hangs down from the
trees above. A nefarious albino jackal towers here, a sickly grin twisted upon
her miasmic maw. What appears to be a mere shadow upon the ground is a dead
demon. A demonic beast lies here, clearly dead. Blood mingles with the pus
surrounding this dead demon. A fat demon lies here dead, the boils on his skin
oozing out the last of their pus. A fat demon covered in boils stands here,
lips twisted into a horrible grin. A deformed demon stands here covered in
blood. There are 2 corpses of a mighty earth golem here. Dotting the ground
around you with black and yellow, lay a massive number of dead bees. A sleek
black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A massive groomed black
stallion stands here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. A
mighty earth golem stands guard here. A swarm of bees hovers menacingly nearby.
Tryon Swiftpaw is here. He wields a sharpened quarterstaff in his hands.
You see exits leading east and northwest.

energy. With a diabolical laugh, you stiffen your hand and slowly run it down
Tryon's chest, splitting it open as you do so. With an expert touch, you rip
apart his innards, causing a maximum of horrifying pain, and, enjoying the
spectacle of Tryon writhing and screaming in agony, you rip out his sternum and
drive it through his splayed body, pinning him to the ground to die.
You have slain Tryon.
