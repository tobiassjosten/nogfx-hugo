Ciguatoxin on CC is much more effective than metrazol or strychnine. If you are using whytes you need to make sure you turn off the auto deaf and auto blindness because for some reason it puts those back up over any other affliction (A particular method Sadie likes to abuse)</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx on 23Â Nov 2010</p>Not my fault if a system puts up blind/deaf over afflictions. :3</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9aae20eae432de96947b1ae57d208b39?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mralexcummings@xxx on 23Â Nov 2010</p>For reference Kyrock has been doing that way longer than Sadie and I think just about every flickwhore knows about that. Also a good note don&rsquo;t worry about throwing in the raze with CCs unless you were doing it to get into right stance and using pindown against a WD is retarded&mldr; flexibility and kipup.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6014a837177b06fcb63ae21bab9256a7?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by wispofdarkness@xxx on 23Â Nov 2010</p>Just need to make sure that you have a code that catches rebounding and shield. If shield, raze then cc. If just aura, cc.

The last time I sparred him, I hit him with cigua and he just stopped fighting. After I killed him he refused to let the spar count towards my requirements because I hit him with things he couldn&rsquo;t cure, or some shit like that.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
