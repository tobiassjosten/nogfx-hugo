I  normally wouldn't issue someone for something like this, but Alitis' player has been biased towards NEaryku for a long time. I've tried many times with civility to come to terms with his hatrwed of Near and make things work since they've been citymates for IRL years, but he just repeats the same thing. Alitis tells you, &#34;((You zerged a non-com )). Santhaea was killed by Nearyku, Xaarin, and Menoch, trying to &#34;bait&#34; other MAgickers to come out since they were hiding in the cities/councils and Santhaea is a leader of Khandava. They both agreed to kill her, so she was slain. Alitis then ordered NEaryku to stand still and let himself be cleaved. He did as ordered, returned from dis. Was citydisfavoured for it right after he died, and was then order to let himself be slain at the springs as many times as Alitis wished until he was happy. This is 3 different punishments that would take a week, maybe two or more to recover from and get back to where I was. This alone is extreme prejudice on his part, many others in the city agreed but no one with any power is willing to contest the decision. Alitis then ousted NEaryku from Stavenn, where he's been a citizen for decades and served with everything he has. He then enemied Nearyku to Kragge, Stavenn, AND the Diavlous for some reason, probably just abusing his power and the whole situation, like he always does to me. I've put up with this crap for a long time, and I'm tired of it. The fact that people can just blow things up and throw anyone out that they wish, slay them, disfavour them, then announce on the Market channel that Nearyku is no longer a stavennite and cannot enter their siege lines for protection? That's ludicrous. I do not have any other Characters I play and Nearyku does not have enough lessons to do anything else, anywhere. He doesn't even have enough lessons from forgetting his Demonic professions to trans one skill. This just ruined my entire point in playing Imperian, a game I've loved for over 5 years now.

I killed Nearyku for making Stavenn look weak by attacking a relatively weak non-combatant 3 against 1. I did not slay the other members of his party because they claimed no knowledge of their target and Alitis trusts them. As for the remaining accusations: there are no rules governing disfavours or branding people enemies, and he was NOT in an election so the only rule for outcitizening was not broken. I admit to violating the rules listed in HELP MARKET in order to inform the world of Nearyku's exile and will accept whatever punishment the admin levies for that.">Issue #96338 Reported by: Nearyku Re: Alitis

Oh and Xaarin was the other person that Alitis trusted.

Hell I&rsquo;ve grinded out a few novices myself, mostly comes down to the circumstance. I feel it&rsquo;s ok if you are in the enemy city trying to soloraid and you get jumped by a pile of them and you pick off the easy targets first. However chasing someone down while they are hunting or just wandering in caanae ect. is the definition of D-Baggery. Alitis has every right to re fuse Nearyku and as much as I think Alitis&rsquo; character is a DBag to the majority of people, I agree with him that he has the right to refuse him. If you really want to get into a guild or organization, you just have to be willing to spend a pile of time being killed, waiting for referendums, or serving out your fine and time. Hell it took Dias almost a year IRL to get into Antioch, props to him for sticking it out, but that&rsquo;s what happens if you are a griefer.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9709d27e0c92499c995b65a9553028e0?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by tonykunz@xxx on 08 Mar 2010</p>If I can quote Jimmy Dugan &ldquo;There&rsquo;s NO CRYING IN BASEBALL!&rdquo;</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f3478fe681299a8ff05fa0eba4db88d?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by kliffmuellerbrennen@xxx (author) on 08 Mar 2010</p><p>Since the log wasn&rsquo;t clear, I&rsquo;ll point out the circumstances:
-Nearyku, under false pretenses, lead two others in a 3 on 1 zerg against Santhaea, who is a non-com and a noob to boot (or at least, for some reason still hunts goblin village). The other two got chewed out but, since it was false pretenses, I didn&rsquo;t punish them severely. For those who don&rsquo;t play Impy, this is considered a PK faux paux, especially in Stavenn which is a PK&rsquo;r heavy city. Lots of people do it, true, but those people tend to be scorned when caught.</p><p>-Nearyku was disfavoured and slain, then returned and tried to feign ignorance when he was leading the party. So I told him to go out and stand at the spring so every single person he has ever griefed can have just revenge. He decided to get snippy and try to claim that what was happening to him was unfair, I decided I didn&rsquo;t want him in the city anymore. Being enemied to Kragge and Stavenn is SOP for all non-citizens/non-guests, being enemied to the Diavlous was because I REALLY don&rsquo;t like Nearyku.</p><p>-As far as whatever others are doing, I&rsquo;m not omniscient, and I&rsquo;m not on 24/7. Only reason I caught this was because I was in the right place at the right time. I&rsquo;m hoping that by setting this example, people will realize if they TELL ME about this sort of thing, I&rsquo;ll actually take action. If the person you&rsquo;re accusing lies and says he didn&rsquo;t do it, RP wise I&rsquo;d be obligated to take the word of a Stavennite over a foreigner, but I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on them all the same.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef71881661d44ae20f25c05ce842c102?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by notnoworforever@xxx on 09 Mar 2010</p>&lt;3 Alitis.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eef50fe9676c8f5aafaaca0e447520ce?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mayena54@xxx on 09 Mar 2010</p>Nearyku is on the same level as Lalaith, Andun and even Kildory. Homo thugs, they act hardcore, gang signs in the air, crotch grab galore until their tenuous facade is revealed. Then they aren&rsquo;t really grabbing at anything, but the empty space where their masculinity used to be, where retribution has now settled as a squatter with no intentions of leaving. Yah Alitis partakes in his share of douche baggery but rather a douche bag then a bitch douche bag, at least he&rsquo;s consistent.
