Outside the gates of Stavenn. (road).
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The
decapitated head of Emeren has been carelessly tossed aside. Defiant in stance,
a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing
eyes of ice blue. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands
here imperially. An old drunk sits behind a table here, drinking his fill.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, and the ominous gates of Stavenn
lie to the west (gate open).

An arrow flies towards you from the northeast.
A thin net trails the arrow, entangling you as it strikes.
