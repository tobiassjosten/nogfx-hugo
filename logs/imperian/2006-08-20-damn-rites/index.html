The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. This has been marked as holy ground. 
A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. Heated breath flaring his 
nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A small oil lamp made of 
tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A lithe desert fox 
slinks cunningly nearby. A fearsome lion prowls around here and greets you with
a warning roar. A marble altar stands tall here, in supreme devotion to Vahin, 
the Protector, and behind it rests a large carved towershield depicting a mace 
and sword, crossed before a set of scales and surrounded by a strange runic 
script. A bald eagle soars about on the thermal currents. Emanating crisp 
comfort, a snowy hammock of moonlit hues hangs here. A cleric of Antioch is 
here carefully scrutinizing passersby. A proud Justicar of the Shah stands here
at attention. A muamrite archer is mounted on a camel, his eyes watching the 
skies with bow at the ready. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large 
cream colored Graytrem draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. A satin 
black wolf stalks silently here. He sniffs the air for prey. An intricately 
carved muamrite guard's spear lies abandoned here. A linseed lies here. The 
shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Angelic Pulse, 
Alithea Vuh'uni is here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a 
spiritual mace in her right. Stablehand Brydun Sylvaleaf, Student of Justice is
here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each hand. You see a sign here 
instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, and northwest.

you.

A Justicar of the Shah smashes his massive forehead into you, making you rock 
backwards at the impact.
