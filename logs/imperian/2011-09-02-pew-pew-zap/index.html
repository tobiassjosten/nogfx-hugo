(Stavenn): Anathema says, \"Rots Tidings, Stavenn.\"

(Stavenn): Erloch says, \"Greetings, Lady Anathema.\"

(Stavenn): You say, \"Hail, Lady.\"

(Stavenn): Sandaya says, \"Greetings, Lady.\"

(Stavenn): Soach says, \"Greetings.\"

(Stavenn): Anathema says, \"How Rots things?\"

(Stavenn): Kari says, \"Greetings Lady.\"

(Stavenn): You say, \"Hopefully not at all, the city should not be looking to 
deteriorate.\"

(Stavenn): Anathema says, \"Too deteriorate, you want it to be pretty with lots 
of pink?\"

(Stavenn): Anathema says, \"Stavenn is stronger than that, strong enough to 
embrace that which Decays and destroys.\"

(Stavenn): You say, \"Again, the Empire is not looking to decay, or deteriorate,
Lady. Perhaps You could elaborate a bit more.\"

(Stavenn): Andorus says, \"Your views are to shallow, Lord Ephor. Decay 
encompassess far more than mere detriment.\"

(Stavenn): Anathema says, \"I shouldn\&#39;t have to elaborate, do you want to see 
Rot first hand?\"

A thin grey mist seeps from the ground, thickening quickly and writhing as if 
comprised of an undulating mass of amorphous shapes. A faint aura of decay 
wafts briefly from the mist as it coalesces into the form of Anathema, the 
Griever.

Anathema tilts Her head curiously at you.

(Stavenn): Soach says, \"There is no need for unpleasantries.\"

Kari gives Anathema an acknowledging nod.

(Stavenn): You say, \"Perhaps I do, as I clearly do not understand.\"

You nod slowly.

You say, \"Hail, Lady.\"

(Stavenn): Andorus says, \"Stave thy tongue, servitor. You are speaking to a 
Divine.\"

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says to Kari, \"He speaks to Me with such 
insolence, does he not understand that everything will in time Rot and that 
embracing it only makes one stronger?\"

(Stavenn): Kari says, \"A demonstration is not a form of unpleasantries, just a 
simple way of providing knowledge.\"

You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.

Imperator Kari Farrell, the Wicked says, \"The Warlord is just known to question
everything he does not understand. It is his way of learning ways he is not 
familiar with.\"

You say, \"I am of Death. Decay is but the slow and agonizing journey to the 
Underworld.\"

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, \"I am not the Goddess to ask questions,
do the mortal thing and do your research.\"

You say, \"Which is why I inquired.\"

You say, \"As an Ephor of this Empire, I beg to differ.\"

Kari shakes her head.

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, \"I am a Goddess, not someone to pander 
to petty mortals that are too lazy to do research.\"

Anathema raises Her hands and sends a bolt of burning blue fire towards 
Juganothion.
A dismal vision is spread before you. You are alone on a barren field, 
soundless but for the chilling moan of the wind. Grey skies envelop a 
remorsefully bleary, blistering sun, while wearied willow trees bereft of 
foliage dip their sagging branches in a seeming sigh to touch the long-dead 
remains of the unfortunate creatures that had thought to seek shelter beneath 
it. This insipid landscape reaches as far and wide as your eyes roam - forever 
a desolate example of Ruin and the end it brings to all life. A sudden breeze 
sweeps ash and smoke into your eyes, and when you next open them you are as you
were before, unscathed but for a cramping in your head.

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, \"You should know, your Lord and I are 
actually allies in this fight against the living.\"

Anathema, Goddess of Putrefaction says, \"And if you don\&#39;t understand that, 
perhaps I should speak to Him.\"

A brief flickering of Her form presages the sudden vanishment of the Griever, 
the hole in reality She once filled left as no more than a spot of cold air 
with a faint redolence of decay. A brief crawling sensation under your skin is 
a chill reminder of the maggots that writhed beneath Her decayed flesh.

You snort arrogantly.

A wall of solid granite. (City of Stavenn.)
There are 3 small packages here. A huge black metal jackal menaces all who 
approach with its baleful glare. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular 
monolith is on the ground. A glass-paneled case stands here, displaying the 
household\&#39;s trophies. The massive body of this white sturgeon lies limp and 
dead. Its gray body limp, this fish is no more. An elite Diavlous Knight is 
manning a netthrower here. He has seventy-eight nets. A lithe, powerful cheetah
roams here. Balanced easily on its oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is
regarding its surroundings with its huge, blue eyes. With a tail wrapped around
a branch to steady itself, a ring-tailed lemur looks about from her tree perch.
Raised up on hind legs, eyes bright with intelligence and curiosity, a rare 
black mongoose is here. A warthog snorts loudly here. Stamping his golden 
hooves and tossing his crimson mane, this blooded warhorse stands here bearing 
a regal strength. Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin 
Valley stands here impassively. Imperator Kari Farrell, the Wicked is here, 
giving off a truly ghastly stench. She is holding a tower shield in her right 
hand.
You see a single exit leading east.

You say to Kari, \"Some Divine just don\&#39;t know how to interact with a true being
of Diachaim.\"

Kari gives a trillingly melodic laugh.

Imperator Kari Farrell, the Wicked says, \"Oh yes, they should be bowing down to
you?\"

You say, \"No.\"

You say, \"Just get out of my way.\"

You narrow your eyes to thin slits.

You hear a high-pitched screaming noise and instantly a bolt of blue, crackling
energy strikes your mortal body. Your back arches as pain explodes in your 
brain. Blue fire erupts through your eye sockets and mouth as you die in 
unspeakable agony.
You have been slain by Anathema.

Your consciousness shifts, and you feel your body no more.

 <dead> 

You feel a moment of disorientation, followed by a sensation of floating upward
as if you had no weight.

 <dead> 

Looking about yourself, you notice that you have in fact risen a few feet above
the ground, and in a terrifying revelation you see your body lying twisted and 
broken before you.

 <dead> 
Ancient remains of a cracked dais.
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. A comforting
feeling of privacy pervades the area. You see a single exit leading east.
By the divine might of Anathema, you are restored to life.
