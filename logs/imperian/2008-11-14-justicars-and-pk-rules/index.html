&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: Kodo says, "He could have avoided his death by not intruding on
our grounds and killing our citizens."
&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: You say, "Fact is, it's an old rule and I'm not even a combatant
I've heard of it."

unavoidable death."
&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: You say, "An unavoidable instant death, no less."

&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: Kodo says, "I just think it's ridiculous. It isn't, it's just
how he could've avoided it."
&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: Kodo says, "And he chose to not avoid it."
&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: Kodo says, "So he died."
&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: Kodo says, "And he whined about it."
&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: You say, "By not exercizing his right to kill people? Come on."
&lt;374/374h 283/283m 1771e 1319w &lt;eb>>
&lt;&lt;Justicars>>: Kodo says, "His right?"
