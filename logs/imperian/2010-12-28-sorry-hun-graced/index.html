The Spirit of Antioch. (City of Antioch.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The room you find yourself in seems 
to be shaded and cool, almost refreshingly so when compared to the heat of the 
city. The walls are a soft hue of sandstone, two oil lamps hanging on opposite 
sides, casting enough light to banish the stray shadows from the corners of the
room. A small opening in the ceiling, sealed with a wooden hatch, allows for 
extra light during the day by swinging it open onto a bracing rod. The floor 
has been covered with a coarsely woven, soft rug, which stretches from wall to 
wall, and allows for the air to pass under hot feet. Several piles of pillows 
lay in one semi-shady corner, the perfect respite from the day to day hustle 
and bustle. On the wall near the door, there is a small window, sealed with a 
half opened canvas flap, the sounds from the Shuk echoing through quietly. This
has been marked as holy ground. A glass windchime has been hung here, the lily 
pads that hang from it constantly clanking together in a soothingly melodic 
manner. A deep green hammock suspended from a smooth mahogany frame sits here, 
swaying gently with any breeze. A very large group of charcoal cinders rests on
the ground. You have entered the campground of Ellanora. An elite Antioch 
cleric is manning a trebuchet here. She has 105 stone commodities. Compeer 
Guardsman Kaem Savann, The Sand Viper is here, hidden. A cloud of smoke fills 
the area, coming from a campfire in the center of a campground. 
You see a single exit leading west.

It is always pretty funny, especially since if I only want it to kill one person, I kill the thing I animated after they die. :D</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7a1400875c7d459cc5b62085ce014a5?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by KaydenMidbere@xxx on 29 Dec 2010</p><p>@ Sagron: It&rsquo;s an expression, leave me alone :(</p><p>@ Guardas: I disagree. There needs to be an ability to kill people who abuse Grace as a means to talk shit. Sure, I&rsquo;ll win my issue against the guy who&rsquo;s abusing it, but all that gets me is Clotho telling them that it&rsquo;s not nice and they should stop that and play fair or else she&rsquo;s going to tell their father when he gets home.</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1926e216bda1b3a8c63459c63464bf85?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by ashel@xxx on 29 Dec 2010</p><p>Ways to avoid dying to an animated Axemaster Balan:</p><ol><li>Walk the fuck away</li></ol></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9aae20eae432de96947b1ae57d208b39?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mralexcummings@xxx on 29 Dec 2010</p>Or be a Aspect and 1shot it like a champ</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92467a33c20ef4c2d82bb7101089334b?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by dgroz093@xxx on 29 Dec 2010</p>Miichelle is apparently a triple blackbelt all possible stripes at Undead Mob annihilation.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7a1400875c7d459cc5b62085ce014a5?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by KaydenMidbere@xxx on 29 Dec 2010</p>THAT IS TOTALLY NOT A PEACEFUL THING TO BE</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10837ba7dca9ea0fca6d0d390ab598ac?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by kuroi_ka_neko@xxx on 29 Dec 2010</p>Peace through power, KD.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f82196323cf7d5b4cd8d44608439bf2?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by guardian106@xxx on 29 Dec 2010</p><p>@Kayden: That&rsquo;s why Grace should last at the most 30 minutes.
