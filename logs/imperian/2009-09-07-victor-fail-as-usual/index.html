Here stand the ruins of a giant archway which marked the passage from the grand
market of Caanae to the mostly residential eastern district. Only the northern 
half of the arch remains, jutting up like an accusing finger. A few fruit trees
grow nearby, detracting only for a moment the gloominess of this place. A great
horned owl is perched here, gazing coldly at his surroundings. A demon 
resembling the wizard Hycanthus idly paces here. A sleek black hound stands 
stone still, ears perked and alert. The decaying remains of Dias lie here. A 
small fenugreek berry lies in danger of being crushed. There are 3 lovage 
leaves in 3 groups here. There are 4 pieces of kelp in 4 groups here. There are
3 linseeds in a group here. There are 6 orphine seeds in 6 groups here. There 
are 9 maidenhair leaves in 9 groups here. There are 4 juniper berries in a 
group here. A mandrake root is here. Keeper of Death, Lady Miegan Vian'Cirith, 
Fallen from Grace is here.
