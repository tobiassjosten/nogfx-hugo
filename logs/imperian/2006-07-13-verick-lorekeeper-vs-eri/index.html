A sheltered valley glade.
This sheltered glade glows with a intriuging light emitted from a strange 
monolith that grows from the very center of the valley. The small dip downwards
from the plains is covered in lush trees whose leaves are tinged with a silvery
caress that gives them a subtle radiance. The monolith itself literally grows 
from the very ground with no seam visible, and its entire surface is covered in
words and symbols of unknown origin. A misty light gathers at the feet of the 
monolith and its tendrils filter thoroughout the entire valley invigorating the
trees with amazing vibrancy and life. Marked with distinguishing white and 
black fur, a large panda bear is here munching lazily on a bamboo stalk. A 
small, plump, anxious looking kestrel waddles around the room crazily. Dame Eri
Kaziganthi, Wild Knight is here. She wields a wooden longbow in her hands.
You see exits leading north, east, and northwest.
A numbing energy runs up your limbs as your attack rebounds off of Eri's 
shield.

A sheltered valley glade.
This sheltered glade glows with a intriuging light emitted from a strange
monolith that grows from the very center of the valley. The small dip downwards
from the plains is covered in lush trees whose leaves are tinged with a silvery
caress that gives them a subtle radiance. The monolith itself literally grows
from the very ground with no seam visible, and its entire surface is covered in
words and symbols of unknown origin. A misty light gathers at the feet of the
monolith and its tendrils filter thoroughout the entire valley invigorating the
trees with amazing vibrancy and life. Marked with distinguishing white and
black fur, a large panda bear is here munching lazily on a bamboo stalk. A
small, plump, anxious looking kestrel waddles around the room crazily. Dame Eri
Kaziganthi, Wild Knight is here. She wields a wooden longbow in her hands.
You see exits leading north, east, and northwest.
