Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. The spring
of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over 
the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.

to appear nearly life-like. Swirling tendrils of soft light wrap themselves 
around the statue, bathing it in a bluish tinge. Calmly gazing upon her 
surroundings with ice blue eyes, a healthy white mare stands here upon strong 
legs. A red and black striped centipede scurries along the ground.
A crumbling pathway leads up.
To the IN you see:
Inside a market stall.
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A saucy

Beneath the waterfall.
The Pool of Inspiration rests here placidly at the base of a grand waterfall, 
shimmering with the silent promises of a new beginning. Beautifully crafted in 
polished white marble, a figure stands enshrouded in robes intricately detailed
to appear nearly life-like. Swirling tendrils of soft light wrap themselves 
around the statue, bathing it in a bluish tinge. Calmly gazing upon her 
surroundings with ice blue eyes, a healthy white mare stands here upon strong 
legs. A red and black striped centipede scurries along the ground.
A crumbling pathway leads up.
To the IN you see:
Inside a market stall.
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A saucy
chipmunk clings to the trees, scolding you for your intrusion. Krask is here.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. The spring
of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over 
the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of

its hem oscillate gently back and forth with the wind. A living vodun doll of 
Dasha lies here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs.
Muscles rippling beneath black bone armour, a massive shire stands here poised 
and alert. A pike with the decapitated head of Rueton has been erected. A pike
