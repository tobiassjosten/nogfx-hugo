A precarious mountain alcove. (Frozen Reaches.)
A naturally occurring niche in the side of a soaring mountain, this paltry 
alcove bears a fairly level floor that ends abruptly a short distance away, its
edge towering far above the terrain beneath. The air here is uncomfortably thin
and the wind vicious, as it buffets against the surrounding rock face. Narrow, 
rocky and endlessly zigzagging, a steep path leads down to the varied lands 
below, lands that from this altitude can easily be observed. A wiry 
crimson-throated songbird darts about in a flurry of motion. A muscular 
mountain lion prowls here, searching for prey. A small black cobra is flaring 
its hood here. Journeywoman Clover Murne Cauthon is here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, south, southwest, and west.

A naturally occurring niche in the side of a soaring mountain, this paltry 
alcove bears a fairly level floor that ends abruptly a short distance away, its
edge towering far above the terrain beneath. The air here is uncomfortably thin
and the wind vicious, as it buffets against the surrounding rock face. Narrow, 
rocky and endlessly zigzagging, a steep path leads down to the varied lands 
below, lands that from this altitude can easily be observed. A wiry 
crimson-throated songbird darts about in a flurry of motion. A muscular 
mountain lion prowls here, searching for prey. A small black cobra is flaring 
its hood here. A nearly perfect sketch of a female drelith floats in midair

Cauthon is here.

A precarious mountain alcove. (Frozen Reaches.)
A naturally occurring niche in the side of a soaring mountain, this paltry
alcove bears a fairly level floor that ends abruptly a short distance away, its
edge towering far above the terrain beneath. The air here is uncomfortably thin
and the wind vicious, as it buffets against the surrounding rock face. Narrow,
rocky and endlessly zigzagging, a steep path leads down to the varied lands
below, lands that from this altitude can easily be observed. A wiry
crimson-throated songbird darts about in a flurry of motion. A muscular
mountain lion prowls here, searching for prey. A small black cobra is flaring
its hood here. Journeywoman Clover Murne Cauthon is here.

alcove bears a fairly level floor that ends abruptly a short distance away, its
edge towering far above the terrain beneath. The air here is uncomfortably thin

rocky and endlessly zigzagging, a steep path leads down to the varied lands
below, lands that from this altitude can easily be observed. A wiry
crimson-throated songbird darts about in a flurry of motion. A muscular
mountain lion prowls here, searching for prey. A small black cobra is flaring
