The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The violent crashing of waves is 
rather deafening as this makeshift path extends to the north and southeast along
the rocky cliff. Though the height of the cliff seems to dwindle off a great 
deal to the north, this particular spot is a solid fifteen metres above the 
turbulent ocean, with constant winds whistling around you. Something of a 
reprieve is visible to the east, where a crack in the rock is just wide enough 
to allow entry. A swirling vortex floats here. 
You see exits leading north, east, and southeast.

Atop a precarious cliff. (road).
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The violent crashing of waves is
rather deafening as this makeshift path extends to the north and southeast along
the rocky cliff. Though the height of the cliff seems to dwindle off a great
deal to the north, this particular spot is a solid fifteen metres above the
turbulent ocean, with constant winds whistling around you. Something of a
reprieve is visible to the east, where a crack in the rock is just wide enough
to allow entry. A swirling vortex floats here.
You see exits leading north, east, and southeast.

The Moon of Life suddenly appears in your vision, and you feel yourself being
drawn towards the Lunar Plane.
A cheerful vestibule.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southwest, west, and northwest.</div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-content"><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 text-center"><p class=lead>0 points with 0 votes</p></div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9aae20eae432de96947b1ae57d208b39?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by mralexcummings@xxx on 09Â Sep 2010</p>they probably had it walled up</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3fd57273d1cd45f320a85ecd7ad20bec?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by falcon32252003@xxx on 09Â Sep 2010</p>No, vortex is specifically said to not be able to pull people out of an obelisk. And monks greater then mages in my mind for obelisk battles, just cause they are more versatile. Once you are inside an obelisk Mage can cata erode and that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s great if you get enough mages. Monks can mind strip, mind tumble, which forces you to get rid of breathing, then others kai choke, or just straight kai choke, or mind clamp to get rid of breathing, then kai choke. And once you are inside, vortex doesn&rsquo;t pull at all toward the obelisk nor can it pull people out, which is dumb.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0" style="max-width:calc(80px + 1.5em)"><img class=float-start src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10837ba7dca9ea0fca6d0d390ab598ac?s=80&d=mp"></div><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Commented by kuroi_ka_neko@xxx on 09Â Sep 2010</p>AM can use anything in their power during Obelisk battles.
Magick can use anything, with the exception of vortex.
Demons can use anything, save vortex and Golgotha.</div></aside><aside class=row><div class="col p-4 pt-0"><p class=fst-italic>Commenting and voting is temporarily disabled.</p></div></aside></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
