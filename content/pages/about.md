Nogfx is an abbreviation for "no graphics" â€“ an homage to the online, text-based games we are dedicated to. Our mission is to spread the gospel and invite more players into our wonderful world of MUDs.

Because _the book is always better_.

This website was first published back in 2006, as a playground to learn web development. It was initially meant to be used only by myself but others seemed to like it and as usage grew, so did the website.

Eventually, development ground to a halt and usage kept dropping off.

Until, in 2022, I found myself with some free time and decided to rebuild and [relaunch Nogfx](/nogfx-is-back/) with a new design and ambitious new goals!

The core is still [our MUD logs](/logs/) but I've also added some useful guides and other resources, as well as a shiny new [MUD client](/client/).

More is yet to come! If you have even just an inkling of curiousity in this amazing world of ours, I suggest [signing up for our newsletter](/subscribe/) to get the latest news and stay up to date with what's happening.
