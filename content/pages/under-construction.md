Not everything is fully operational here yet. But we're working on it!

Did you want to upload a new log? Post a comment somewhere? The only way to do that right now is via [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/tobiassjosten/nogfx-web).

I understand that it's annoying but I'm going to fix that soon and you'll be able to handle everything directly through the website, as before.

Sign up to [the newsletter](/subscribe/) and I'll let you know when it's done!
