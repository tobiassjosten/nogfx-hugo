The Nogfx MUD client is the result of scratching my own itch.

_I wanted_ a client that **runs at the speed of lightning**, never freezing at a critical moment because it's processing game mechanics.

_I wanted_ a client that **works in the terminal**, free of graphics and fluff. I play MUDs for a reason and don't want any of this distracting cruft.

_I wanted_ a client that **integrates deeply** with the games I play. It should improve my gameplay and not only be a glorified Telnet client.

That doesn't leave me with a whole lot of options.

Being a software engineer, however, and one who thinks that one of the best parts of playing MUDs is the coding aspect, I set out to create my dream client from scratch. This is the result of that.

No distracting images, no useless features, no cruft.

Nogfx.

I want to stress that I'm not dissing the existing clients. Many have served me well in the past and are great pieces of software engineering.

They're just not for me and my very specific requirements at this point.

I also realize that I'm probably in the minority here and that there might not be a whole lot of people with a matching wish list.

If you are, though, I think you'll really like what I'm building here.

## Join me!

There's not a first, stable release yet and the client changes a lot from one week to another. So now is the time to help shape the foundation.

I'd love your input!

Take it for a test spin and tell me what you think, check out and review the code, or send me your own additions with a pull request. The project is open source and very welcoming to anyone who wants to help out.
