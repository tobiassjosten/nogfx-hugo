Nogfx is a community for MUD players. Its purpose is to spread the gospel of our text-based worlds and help more players get immersed in this fantastic genre of gaming.

One of the main attractions around here, at the moment, is [our logs archive](/logs/), where you can share in others' gaming experiences.

Be sure to also check out our brand new [MUD client](/client/), which has been built from the ground up to help improve your gameplay.

Finally, we're working on guides for gamers ranging from the complete beginner to the hardcore veteran, covering topics like roleplaying, combat, scripting, and anything in between.

Please [let me know](/contact/) if you're keen to pitch in with your expertise!
