Outside the Libra dungeon (road).
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The trees here are 
quite large around, and although they are a mighty sight, they seem to be the 
only plant life around for awhile. The rest must have been trampled to death by 
whatever has beaten the large dirt path into the ground here. There is a strange
aroma coming from somewhere, but you can't seem to place it. Nestled next to one
trunk, hidden by some dead bushes obviously meant to conceal it, is a stairway 
leading down. A rune that looks like a stick man has been sketched into the 
ground here. A small wooden sign is nailed crookedly to a post here.
You see exits leading east, northwest, and down.

Ivy-covered archway to Minia (road).
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Vellis,
the butterfly collector potters about nearby. A small wooden sign is nailed 
crookedly to a post here. An heraldic pennon flies here, bearing the house arms 
of The Sect of the Black Lotus. A flame-charred chariot pulled by demonic goats 
stands here. Natri is seated here. Daryl is here. He wields a butterfly net in 
his left hand. Tribal Tler'en is here. He wields a hunter's spear in his left 
hand and a throwing axe in his right.
You see exits leading northeast, east, southeast, and south.

By the northern tip of the lake.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. You 
stand at the most northern tip of Lake Vundamere, from here able to view the 
great body of water in all its tranquil glory. To the east, along the banks of 
the lake, and beyond, the Ithmia forest rises up, while to the west, somewhat 
smaller, though still vast compared to the scale and duration of man's own 
pitiful existence, the Aureliana forest follows the line of the lake stretching 
somewhat farther to the south. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular 
monolith is on the ground. The twisted remains of Rhedyn lie here. Tribal 
Tler'en is here. He wields a hunter's spear in his left hand and a throwing axe 
in his right.

that the girl made strictly to harass me? If this isn't the same girl, then my

Harasssment. Even if I am the girl stalking him OOCly, that is absolutely no 
reason to kill me twice over something that cannot even be claimed as insult 
cause ("An insult must meet several qualifications: ... ... ... - The insult 
must be serious (serious name-calling, profanity, questioning the sexual habits 
of the victim or victim's family, etc).") HELP PKCAUSE states that Harassment is
also defined as "bringing out of character differences or disputes into Achaea".
He obviously believes that I am someone else, and is thus killing me several 
times for this.  Tribal is ruining my gameplay experience over a single 
unconfirmed belief and obviously will not stop doing so until I leave Achaea.

same way you've been ruining mine! If the Divine won't do anything but shrub 
your useless damned alts into oblivion just for you to make more to bug the piss
out of me with, then I'm going to make the pitiful excuse of a character you 
have right now suffer. Deal with it, cry me a river. If I get in trouble over 
this, I accept it. You've _RUINED_ my gameplay on NUMEROUS times. I would LOVE 
to see you leave Achaea, I long for it Valnia, you little snake. All you do is 
bug the piss out of people and try to mudsex people so you can post it all over

insulted me several times in our previous issue. Even if I did happen to be

wish only to play the game and he instead chooses to kill me wherever I set 
foot. This has gone on way too long, I kindly request action be taken.

you know what this is? It's called payback. Something I should've given you a 
looonnngggg time ago, instead of just issuing like I always did. I'm not 
harassing you, girl. Your only motive is to get me shrubbed, which is why you 
continue to break the issuing rule, and issue me again, and again, and again. 
Learn to read HELP ISSUING. Don't issue more than once for the same thing? Sound
familiar Valnia? I'll stop after you Pray for Salvation one more time, then I'll
consider us even. Remotely.
