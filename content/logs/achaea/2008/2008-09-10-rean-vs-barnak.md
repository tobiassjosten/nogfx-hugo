He is a tiger-like Rajamala and is a devoted Ashuran. He is 6 foot 2 inch tall 
and by the look of it, he may weight around 220 pounds. You can see that he pass
quite some time on training hard, as all his muscle are well defined. His fur is
black and he has the finest green eyes in all Sapience. A piece of his ear is 
missing, probably lost in combat. He is wearing a trader's satchel, an amber 
stud earring through his left ear, a wreathed oceanic armband of silver and 
onyx, a pair of shiny black leather shoes, a dragonskin pack, a gold medallion, 
a suit of leather armour, an Intellect Crown, a Belt of the Titans, an Amulet of
the Will, Gauntlets of the Aldar, a Ceylonese bracelet, brass knuckles, a pair 
of loose-fitting white tekura trousers, and a shimmering white satin tekura gi 
shirt.

He is a powerful Troll and is very tall and board. His shoulders are very thick 
and muscular, leading down to arms which are equally muscular. A firm face is 
set with strangely hazel eyes, occasionally sparkling with amusement. A 
mischieviously playful grin would usually be found on the troll's face, 
revealing his fun-loving nature. His stalwart chest and legs share the troll's 
build, hinting at years of strength and endurance training. The skin of this 
troll is a darkish blue, reminiscent of the deep sea. Ebon hair falls to the 
troll's shoulders, rarely appearing any neater than running a quick hand through
it. He is wearing a delicate coral bracelet, a pair of black leather runic 
boots, a canvas backpack, a rugged pair of rich brown trousers, a pocketbelt, a 
plain silver ring, a suit of leather armour, and a ranger's armband of tanned 
leather.

floor, while crowds are constantly streaming out from the passage entrance and

Upon a pier near the Darkshade River. (Lisigia Village)
You are standing upon the single pier of Lisigia Village. Hooks with ropes 
attached to fishing boats have been driven into the wooden pier surface, while a
number of tree bases have been smoothed into seats for the less boatworthy 
fishermen. To the east lies the village itself - though even from this vantage 
you are able to determine that Lisigia is a mere hamlet. Odours which rise out 
of the general melange include the inevitable fish, and the even more inevitable
musty tang of woodsmoke. The Darkshade River runs southwestwards and southwards 
from the end of the pier. Gunsou Barnak the Dragon Khisan-Foo is here, sprawled 
on the floor.
You see exits leading east and southwest.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Looming 
above you is the most enormous structure in this city, the grand Stadia Coronae.
It is circular in shape, its walls rise a staggering three hundred feet into the
air, pitted with countless mosaic and alcoves set with statues devoted to the 
divinities who have pledged to watch over the Crown. Providing entrance to the 
Stadia is a small door which leads through a narrow passage up, you assume, into
the spectator stands beyond. Certainly this remarkable building is one of the 
greatest wonders you have witnessed, a giant testimony to the skill of the 
Hashanite People. Advance into the combat area of the Stadia is blocked by a 
portal made of an odd translucent substance that seems to pulsate with power. 
The portal is framed with silver gates and is lined with rubies and diamonds. 
The portal, although not made of water, seems to be flowing and weaving about 
its frame, sucking the light that exists here. The figure of Valnurana, Goddess 
of Sleep and Dreams stands here, rendered in ghostly fire opal. A huge statue of
Twilight stands here, with His massive wingspan darkening much of this area. A 
massive statue of Ourania stands on a triangular marble dais, shining with a

You are south of the Northern Wealds of Lisigia at the source of two small 
streams. The streams snake off away to the southwest and eventually merge with 
the Darkshade River, while to the southeast the plains dip down into the 
wetlands of Damballah Lake. Northwards lies the tranquillity of the Wealds, 
while to the far southwest you can discern a dip in the plains which betrays the
presence of a wide and fast flowing river. In the far distances you can 
determine nothing of desperate interest, save a plume of smoke many leagues to 
the south.

quite some time on training hard, as all his muscle are well defined. His fur is
black and he has the finest green eyes in all Sapience. A piece of his ear is 
missing, probably lost in combat. He is wearing a trader's satchel, an amber 
stud earring through his left ear, a wreathed oceanic armband of silver and 
onyx, a pair of shiny black leather shoes, a dragonskin pack, a gold medallion, 
a suit of leather armour, an Intellect Crown, a Belt of the Titans, an Amulet of

Darkshade River before a village pier. (Darkshade River)
The stream-like waters of the Darkshade run very softly here, as it carelessly 
meanders between the spurs of gently rolling foothills. Sights of great interest
are few and far between in a landscape not so much barren as devoid of 
exceptions. Rolling hills are an inadequate food for your hungry eyes, both 
west, south and east, while the ominous shadow of the Northern Wealds act as a 
constant reminder of where you are located. Northeastwards is a small, 
unassuming river pier belonging to a tiny fishing village which has made its 
home here. The stream that was once the Darkshade River dips into an underground
tunnel beneath a rocky outcrop to the north. Hence you can go no further along 
the river here, though you can progress northeastwards onto the river pier and 
southwestward back to the source of the river. Gunsou Barnak the Dragon 
Khisan-Foo is here.

Darkshade River before a village pier. (Darkshade River)
The stream-like waters of the Darkshade run very softly here, as it carelessly 
meanders between the spurs of gently rolling foothills. Sights of great interest
are few and far between in a landscape not so much barren as devoid of 
exceptions. Rolling hills are an inadequate food for your hungry eyes, both 
west, south and east, while the ominous shadow of the Northern Wealds act as a 
constant reminder of where you are located. Northeastwards is a small, 
unassuming river pier belonging to a tiny fishing village which has made its 
home here. The stream that was once the Darkshade River dips into an underground
tunnel beneath a rocky outcrop to the north. Hence you can go no further along 
the river here, though you can progress northeastwards onto the river pier and 
southwestward back to the source of the river. Gunsou Barnak the Dragon

Darkshade River before a village pier. (Darkshade River)
The stream-like waters of the Darkshade run very softly here, as it carelessly 
meanders between the spurs of gently rolling foothills. Sights of great interest
are few and far between in a landscape not so much barren as devoid of 
exceptions. Rolling hills are an inadequate food for your hungry eyes, both 
west, south and east, while the ominous shadow of the Northern Wealds act as a 
constant reminder of where you are located. Northeastwards is a small, 
unassuming river pier belonging to a tiny fishing village which has made its 
home here. The stream that was once the Darkshade River dips into an underground
tunnel beneath a rocky outcrop to the north. Hence you can go no further along

meanders between the spurs of gently rolling foothills. Sights of great interest
are few and far between in a landscape not so much barren as devoid of 
exceptions. Rolling hills are an inadequate food for your hungry eyes, both 
west, south and east, while the ominous shadow of the Northern Wealds act as a 
constant reminder of where you are located. Northeastwards is a small, 
unassuming river pier belonging to a tiny fishing village which has made its 
home here. The stream that was once the Darkshade River dips into an underground
tunnel beneath a rocky outcrop to the north. Hence you can go no further along

Darkshade River before a village pier. (Darkshade River)
The stream-like waters of the Darkshade run very softly here, as it carelessly 
meanders between the spurs of gently rolling foothills. Sights of great interest
are few and far between in a landscape not so much barren as devoid of 
exceptions. Rolling hills are an inadequate food for your hungry eyes, both 
west, south and east, while the ominous shadow of the Northern Wealds act as a 
constant reminder of where you are located. Northeastwards is a small, 
unassuming river pier belonging to a tiny fishing village which has made its 
home here. The stream that was once the Darkshade River dips into an underground
tunnel beneath a rocky outcrop to the north. Hence you can go no further along 
the river here, though you can progress northeastwards onto the river pier and 
southwestward back to the source of the river. Gunsou Barnak the Dragon 
Khisan-Foo is here.

Darkshade River before a village pier. (Darkshade River)
The stream-like waters of the Darkshade run very softly here, as it carelessly 
meanders between the spurs of gently rolling foothills. Sights of great interest
are few and far between in a landscape not so much barren as devoid of 
exceptions. Rolling hills are an inadequate food for your hungry eyes, both 
west, south and east, while the ominous shadow of the Northern Wealds act as a 
constant reminder of where you are located. Northeastwards is a small, 
unassuming river pier belonging to a tiny fishing village which has made its 
home here. The stream that was once the Darkshade River dips into an underground
tunnel beneath a rocky outcrop to the north. Hence you can go no further along 
the river here, though you can progress northeastwards onto the river pier and 
southwestward back to the source of the river. Gunsou Barnak the Dragon 
Khisan-Foo is here.
You see exits leading northeast and southwest.

Spectator stands of the Stadia Coronae. (Hashan)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Row upon
row of wooden benches arc around the Stadia Coronae, encircling the central ring
with potential spectators. On active days the Stadia is a hive of activity, 
people jostling noisily with each other to gain a view of the action on the 
floor, while crowds are constantly streaming out from the passage entrance and 
taking their seats amongst their friends and compatriots. Here you are at the 
very back of the benches, at the highest point of the Stadia, able to look down 
on the entire scene. A portal made of an odd translucent substance pulsates with
power here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape
of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A mottled Mhojave Desert 
falcon glides effortlessly to and fro.
You see a single exit leading north.

You are being drawn inwards towards the centre of this mist-covered lake. 
Somehow the current drifts inexorably inwards as if the lake has assumed the 
characteristics of human introversion. The air about you is thick with a soupy 
grey mist which obscures your vision to any of the lake shores. However, your 
attention is captured above all by the very centre of the lake for poking 
proudly up above the surface mist is an obelisk. Atop the obelisk is an ebony 
owl which, despite the gentle breeze, remains affixed in a northerly direction. 
You wonder at the age of this obelisk at the centre of Damballah and, since it 
would be the tallest point of any town, at what other secrets are concealed 
beneath the surface.

You find yourself progressing towards a small fishing village - for the hamlet 
of Lisigia built upon the Darkshade River lies a short distance to the south. To
the southeast, the shores of Damballah Lake are a welcome break from the rolling
foothills surrounding you, though it holds an inexplicable aura which seems to 
wish away your presence. To the north, a few leagues distant is a small woodland
of mixed firs and beech trees. Gunsou Barnak the Dragon Khisan-Foo is here.

Northwestern edge of Damballah Lake. (Damballah Lake)
With no current to fight against in these more shallow waters you are able to 
glide through the stillness of the lake with consummate ease. The land that 
emerges northwest of here out of the waters steeps quickly up to a small 
embankment, supported by the occasional boulder and mass of small rocks, and 
already you can hear the echoing slap at its banks brought about by the lake's 
subtle tide even though you are more than a little way out from the shore 
proper. Leaking out to the southeastern horizon is the lake's entire expanse, 
itself eventually interrupted by a shoreline, you presume, although a distinct 
image of its southern coast is just barely visible at this range. Gunsou Barnak

Northwestern edge of Damballah Lake. (Damballah Lake)
With no current to fight against in these more shallow waters you are able to 
glide through the stillness of the lake with consummate ease. The land that 
emerges northwest of here out of the waters steeps quickly up to a small 
embankment, supported by the occasional boulder and mass of small rocks, and 
already you can hear the echoing slap at its banks brought about by the lake's 
subtle tide even though you are more than a little way out from the shore 
proper. Leaking out to the southeastern horizon is the lake's entire expanse, 
itself eventually interrupted by a shoreline, you presume, although a distinct 
image of its southern coast is just barely visible at this range. Gunsou Barnak
