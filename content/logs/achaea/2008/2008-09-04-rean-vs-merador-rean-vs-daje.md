Caves in the Arena. (Oops, we're lost) (Caves in the Arena?)
Thin shafts of light illuminate this mouldy cavern, breaking through a thin gap 
in the rock. A cool breeze drifts in from cracks in the chert stone cavern, 
chilling the damp air. Streaming down the walls, rivulets of water flow into 
puddles along the floor with a soft splashing sound. The cavern bottlenecks into
a dark passage, which curves deeper into the caves, winding away towards shadowy
recesses untouched by light.
You see exits leading east, south, and west.

He is a Mhun and is slightly taller than average, his broad shoulders filling 
out his long limbs as to not appear frail.  His face is long, oval-shaped, his 
jaw strong though appearing as if he hasn't shaved in a day or so, the black 
shadow bringing the lines of his face to further contrast.  His hair, the color 
of a starless night, falls along the sides of his face and past his jaw in a 
dark line.  However, his eyes are what catches most attention, the ruby orbs 
dark and deep-set, flickering constantly as he glances at his surroundings.  The
small flecks of black mingle within the crimson iris, deepening the red to a 
blood-like hue. He is wearing a pair of classy black trousers, a bag of stasis, 
a canvas backpack, a steel skull and crossbones ring, a plain gold ring, 2 plain
silver rings, a blackened steel armband of thorns, a blackened medallion marred 
with char marks, 3 plain steel rings, a shimmering golden pouch, a simple bone 
ring, a black steel mask, a long, black Infernals cloak, ebon-black cotton dress

Moist and fertile, the earth creates the perfect conditions for mosses and

Gaian forest near Modi river. (Gaian Forest)
The large oak trees thin in number, making way for crack willows and slender 
alder. The sound of rushing water wafts through the trees, mingling with 
birdsong and the gentle rustle of leaves as breezes drift through the forest. 
Moist and fertile, the earth creates the perfect conditions for mosses and 
clover to thrive, and tiny white flowers speckle the verdant patches of growth. 
Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some 
movement in the distance. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in 
mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and contort to 
the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated 
with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A 
stinking noxious cloud floats here. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone 
hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. 
Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.

Gaian forest near Modi river. (Gaian Forest)
The large oak trees thin in number, making way for crack willows and slender 
alder. The sound of rushing water wafts through the trees, mingling with 
birdsong and the gentle rustle of leaves as breezes drift through the forest. 
Moist and fertile, the earth creates the perfect conditions for mosses and 
clover to thrive, and tiny white flowers speckle the verdant patches of growth. 
Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some 
movement in the distance. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in 
mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and contort to 
the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated 
with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A 
stinking noxious cloud floats here. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone 
hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side.

Gaian forest near Modi river. (Gaian Forest)
The large oak trees thin in number, making way for crack willows and slender 
alder. The sound of rushing water wafts through the trees, mingling with 
birdsong and the gentle rustle of leaves as breezes drift through the forest. 
Moist and fertile, the earth creates the perfect conditions for mosses and 
clover to thrive, and tiny white flowers speckle the verdant patches of growth. 
Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some 
movement in the distance. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in 
mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and contort to 
the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Bloated 
with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A 
stinking noxious cloud floats here. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone 
hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. 
Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.
You see exits leading northeast, southwest, west, and northwest.

Gaian forest near Modi river. (Oops, we're lost) (Gaian Forest)
The large oak trees thin in number, making way for crack willows and slender

Moist and fertile, the earth creates the perfect conditions for mosses and 
clover to thrive, and tiny white flowers speckle the verdant patches of growth.

stinking noxious cloud floats here. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone

to die, Merador proceeds to rip apart your organs, magnifying the pain until you
are driven nearly mad. With a detached smile upon his face, he proceeds to rip 
out your sternum and drive it through your already splayed-out body, pinning it 
to the ground and finally killing you.
You have been slain by Merador.

before you, in all its vastness. You see the Erisian Tower rising from the 
middle, and the gladiator pit in the northeastern corner. Your eye roves to the 
small Gaian forest within, and to the caves in the southeast. The Modi river 
catches your eye as it flows, sparkling like sapphire. The mighty Sarapin plinth
stands tall and proud east of a cobblestone square to the north of the river. 
Truly, the varied environments that make up this tremendously historical Arena 
are interesting indeed. Standing in a long row at the front of the stands are a 
series of pedestals with some sort of odd green globe attached to each of them.

Arena Staging Grounds. (Isle of Delos)
Consisting of rows of simple wooden benches set around an open plain the Staging
Grounds of the Arena are very spartan in their arrangement. This is obviously 
not meant as a place for socialising. To the rear of the seating area is a 
large, free-standing portal. Beside the portal stands a sign that reads, "If you
would like information on using the Matsuhama Arena, use HELP ARENA." Some 
graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "~Vials of Venoms only 500 gold at 
Malevolent Armoury ~ AD 34 for info~." A cute little humgii is sitting here 
placidly, attached to a leash. A black, murky mist has settled here. Daje 
Kindfire is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

Sunken gladiators' pit. (Matsuhama Arena)
The ground here is littered with arrows, some of which are broken or snapped in 
half. Dried bloodstains have blossomed over the hard earth, the result of the 
brutal battles waged by gladiators in their desperate attempts to survive to see
another day. The area smells of rot and rust, an aroma that becomes increasingly
unpleasant if one lingers within the pit for too long. A mottled Mhojave Desert 
falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone 
push up from the ground.

He is a lizard-like Xoran and is and is closer to five feet tall. His eyes 
narrow quickly as he glances eerily about the room, grimacing at you. He quickly
grins at you in a very obtuse manner, almost malevolent, until it leaves his 
face as quickly as it came. The index finger on his right hand twitches 
incessantly, constantly straightening and curling back up, uneasy and waiting 
for even the most miniscule movement. He has naught but one tattoo on the back 
of his neck, it reads 'In Vorago es Iacio'. As you size him up, you notice a 
massive scar running up the entirety of his left calf that appears to have 
long-since healed. He is wearing 4 plain steel rings, a buckawn's amulet, a 
canvas backpack, black trousers, a suit of polished field plate armour, a pair 
of soft brown hiking boots, a black hooded cloak, a quiver, a black shirt, a 
Ceylonese bracelet, a leather falconry glove, a pocketbelt, and a Ceylonese 
ring.

city of Shallam, The Paladins and The Priests mostly. On the opposite side you 
observe a murky darkness resembling The City of Mhaldor, The Apostates, 
Necromancy users, and Occultists. Another wall shows vines climbing along its 
walls representing The Village of Eleusis, The Druids, Sentinels, and Sylvans. A
vortex of colours appears on another wall demonstrating the elements used with 
elementalism used by mages. Hanging on another wall are gloves and worn out 
weaponry depicting the warrior classes of the lands such as the Monks or even 
the Runewardens Knights. Another wall shows the musical talent of the Bards, and
the humour of the Jesters class. Serpents covering another wall show the guile 
of a slick member of the Serpent class using venoms against a Shaman using 
curses and Runes to defend himself. The last wall shows a calm fire with 
pictures of various people throughout Sapience. Above the many pictures is one 
solid word written in bright orange or all to see, "KINDFIRES". Elode stands 
here with a soft smile on her face. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push

Sunken gladiators' pit. (Matsuhama Arena)
The ground here is littered with arrows, some of which are broken or snapped in 
half. Dried bloodstains have blossomed over the hard earth, the result of the 
brutal battles waged by gladiators in their desperate attempts to survive to see
another day. The area smells of rot and rust, an aroma that becomes increasingly
unpleasant if one lingers within the pit for too long. A mottled Mhojave Desert 
falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone 
push up from the ground.
You see exits leading north, west, and up.

The falcon dives at you and throws you off balance.

You move in towards Daje for the backbreaker.
You lift Daje triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised 
knee with back breaking force.
With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, Daje's head lolls aimlessly far 
too far to one side. Daje collapses into such an undignified sprawl that you 
realise that the throw did indeed snap the spine like a dry twig.
You have slain Daje.
The ground churns as the grotesque maggots writhing across it wriggle furiously,
digging downwards and quickly disappearing beneath the earth.

Arena Staging Grounds.
Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "~Vials of Venoms only 500 gold 
at Malevolent Armoury ~ AD 34 for info~." A cute little humgii is sitting here 
placidly, attached to a leash. A black, murky mist has settled here.
You see a single exit leading southwest.
The Arena is once again open for combat.
