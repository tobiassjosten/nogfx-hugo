North of New Thera (road). (Central Wilderness)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The great highway 
stretches north and southeast across the land, while a smaller, more poorly kept
road connects to it from the southwest. This road is the link through the Black 
Forest and beyond into the Savannah, Dakhota Hills, and finally the formidable 
Mhojave Desert. A frequent rendezvous place, the highway margins are trampled 
and the grasses flattened by the many beings who meet here. Debris often litters
the place until blown away by the gusty winds. A polished wooden sign is nailed 
to a small tree here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A ladder of long, soft 
leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground.

A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
great highway stretches north and southeast across the land, while a smaller, 
more poorly kept road connects to it from the southwest. This road is the link 
through the Black Forest and beyond into the Savannah, Dakhota Hills, and 
finally the formidable Mhojave Desert. A frequent rendezvous place, the highway 
margins are trampled and the grasses flattened by the many beings who meet here.
Debris often litters the place until blown away by the gusty winds. A polished 
wooden sign is nailed to a small tree here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A

great highway stretches north and southeast across the land, while a smaller,

A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
great highway stretches north and southeast across the land, while a smaller, 
more poorly kept road connects to it from the southwest. This road is the link 
through the Black Forest and beyond into the Savannah, Dakhota Hills, and 
finally the formidable Mhojave Desert. A frequent rendezvous place, the highway 
margins are trampled and the grasses flattened by the many beings who meet here.

wooden sign is nailed to a small tree here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A 
ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground.
