On the clouds. (Skies)
You are high above the Sapience mainland with a view that is nothing short of 
outstanding. Below you are scattered clouds, and further below you see a falcon 
wheeling and banking in pursuit of its meal. A ladder of long, soft leaves 
comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Resting on the ground is a 
cube-shaped silver sigil. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed 
its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Wings folded against his 
back, Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Wings 
flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Furiae, a sable 
megachiropteran, whirs quietly here, wings at rest. Chantrelle Khisan-Foo, 
Forest's Nightingale is here. Ivory Tempest Entaro Windsong, Pontifex Fluvialis 
is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his left hand and a bard's flute in
his right. Sir Goryllin Dawyn, Senator of Cyrene is riding on an alabaster 
pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

Kandor says in a harsh, aggressive voice, "Anytime."
5465h, 2921m, 18763e, 10620w cxkdb-  (19:7:1:253)
Entaro stares meaningfully at a soulmaster and furtively makes a small gesture 
in front of his neck.
5465h, 2921m, 18763e, 10620w cxkdb-  (19:7:1:253)
Kandor cups his hands before him. An unearthly violet glow fills his cupped 
hands and solidifies into an amethyst resembling Kandor.

Under a gnarled oak. (Eastern Ithmia)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A giant old oak towers 
above all the other trees in the area. Its long limbs shade a large area, 
providing ample places to relax in its cooling comfort. The trunk of this 
ancient behemoth has gnarled over the years, perhaps due to some pesky mistletoe
or other parasite, creating a club-shaped gall. The large malformation has a 
profound effect on the bark, creating intricate swirls and shapes in the rough 
skin of the tree. In certain lighting, the gall rather resembles a knobby face, 
complete with bushy eyebrows and a whimsical smile. Someone, most likely a 
dryad, has tucked several wildflowers into the bark just above the smiling face.
A low-slung myrrh bush is here. A green-flowered ginseng plant has been planted 
here. A purple coneflower grows here, its large stalk straining towards the sky.
A low-lying wild ginger plant is growing here. A red elm tree grows here, its

Under a gnarled oak. (Eastern Ithmia)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A giant old oak towers 
above all the other trees in the area. Its long limbs shade a large area, 
providing ample places to relax in its cooling comfort. The trunk of this 
ancient behemoth has gnarled over the years, perhaps due to some pesky mistletoe
or other parasite, creating a club-shaped gall. The large malformation has a 
profound effect on the bark, creating intricate swirls and shapes in the rough 
skin of the tree. In certain lighting, the gall rather resembles a knobby face, 
complete with bushy eyebrows and a whimsical smile. Someone, most likely a 
dryad, has tucked several wildflowers into the bark just above the smiling face.
A low-slung myrrh bush is here. A green-flowered ginseng plant has been planted 
here. A purple coneflower grows here, its large stalk straining towards the sky.
A low-lying wild ginger plant is growing here. A red elm tree grows here, its 
branches gently swaying in the breeze. A lobelia wildflower is growing here. A 
large beehive hangs down from the trees above. A runic totem is planted solidly 
in the ground. There are 3 monolith sigils here. A mighty earth golem stands 
guard here. A small Lupine plinth stands here in harmony with nature. Captain 
Delphinus Windancer, the Gatecrasher is here. He wields a sharpened quarterstaff
in both hands. You may enter the wilderness map from here.

Low-hanging branches. (Black Forest)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The rustle of leaves is the only sound
to encroach upon the silence that pervades this area. Thick, contorted limbs of 
ancient oaks and elms droop low to the ground, a few of the heaviest nearly 
ready to crack under their own weight. A section of one large tree limb touches 
the ground before arcing upward, spreading its leaves over itself and creating a
quiet sitting area for two. All around, a damp layer of leaves blankets the 
forest floor, emitting a musty odour and sprouting scattered clumps of small 
brown mushrooms. A low-slung myrrh bush is here. A green-flowered ginseng plant 
has been planted here. A low-lying wild ginger plant is growing here. A purple

Low-hanging branches. (Black Forest)

the ground before arcing upward, spreading its leaves over itself and creating a
quiet sitting area for two. All around, a damp layer of leaves blankets the 
forest floor, emitting a musty odour and sprouting scattered clumps of small 
brown mushrooms. A low-slung myrrh bush is here. A green-flowered ginseng plant

wheeling and banking in pursuit of its meal. A ladder of long, soft leaves 
comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Resting on the ground is a 
cube-shaped silver sigil. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed 
its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Wings folded against his 
back, Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Wings 
flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Furiae, a sable 
megachiropteran, whirs quietly here, wings at rest. Ivory Tempest Entaro 
Windsong, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his 
left hand and a bard's flute in his right. Chantrelle Khisan-Foo, Forest's

comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Resting on the ground is a 
cube-shaped silver sigil. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed 
its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Wings folded against his 
back, Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Wings 
flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Furiae, a sable 
megachiropteran, whirs quietly here, wings at rest. A crackling chaos orb floats
and bobs here. A Baalzadeen demon towers over you, filling you with dread. 
Chantrelle Khisan-Foo, Forest's Nightingale is here. Ivory Tempest Entaro 
Windsong, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his

terrifying nightmares of some mechanical genius. If it were blooded and living, 
it would likely be nothing but a gigantic bat, but metallic plating and the cold
hum of gears torquing deep within betray its unnatural heritage. Once crafted as
a simple transportation method for navigating Clockwork Isle, it has been fitted
and modified for battle. Possessed of naught but a simple intelligence, its flat
black eyes stare blankly ahead, awaiting impetus or stimulus to ignite motion or
response. Obsidian wings expand lazily to an intimidating span, with razor-sharp
claws on the second finger of each. Some sort of dire energy arises from within 
the belly of this creature, and an everlasting tang of blood and steam taints 
the air around it.

wheeling and banking in pursuit of its meal. A ladder of long, soft leaves 
comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Resting on the ground is a 
cube-shaped silver sigil. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed 
its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Wings folded against his 
back, Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Wings 
flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A Baalzadeen demon towers 
over you, filling you with dread. The bizarre form of a chimera stands here, 
flickering its wings. Furiae, a sable megachiropteran, whirs quietly here, wings
at rest. A sharp-toothed gremlin is here, hopping from foot to foot. A crackling
chaos orb floats and bobs here. Chantrelle Khisan-Foo, Forest's Nightingale is 
here. Sir Goryllin Dawyn, Senator of Cyrene is riding on an alabaster pegasus. 
He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Ivory Tempest Entaro Windsong, 
Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his left hand

You are high above the Sapience mainland with a view that is nothing short of 
outstanding. Below you are scattered clouds, and further below you see a falcon 
wheeling and banking in pursuit of its meal. A ladder of long, soft leaves 
comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Resting on the ground is a 
cube-shaped silver sigil. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed 
its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Wings folded against his 
back, Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Wings 
flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A Baalzadeen demon towers 
over you, filling you with dread. The bizarre form of a chimera stands here, 
flickering its wings. Furiae, a sable megachiropteran, whirs quietly here, wings
at rest. A sharp-toothed gremlin is here, hopping from foot to foot. A crackling
chaos orb floats and bobs here. Chantrelle Khisan-Foo, Forest's Nightingale is 
here. Sir Goryllin Dawyn, Senator of Cyrene is riding on an alabaster pegasus. 
He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Ivory Tempest Entaro Windsong, 
Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his left hand 
and a bard's flute in his right. Droch Kandor is here.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. You are beneath a broad tract of 
sycamores, which have taken over this particular section of the forest. The 
trees are huge, and have obviously been growing for a considerable number of 
years, left undisturbed by the hands of man. From between the thick foliage of 
the boughs, light filters through to the forest floor, where the small seed pods
of the sycamore litter the ground, occasionally whirring the ground before your 
eyes, as they fall from the trees. A purple coneflower grows here, its large 
stalk straining towards the sky. A low-slung myrrh bush is here. A 
green-flowered ginseng plant has been planted here. A lobelia wildflower is 
growing here. A low-lying wild ginger plant is growing here. A red elm tree

Snarled thicket. (Oops, we're lost) (Aureliana Forest)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Like 
walls of thorn shod iron, twisted about and half strangling each other, vines 
and branches of brambly design weave a protective ring of near impassability 
about this tiny thicket in the embrace of the wood. Waving leaves of silver 
veined emerald sway themselves in whispering life as summer's keen intensity 
sets the land to lazing. Animals and insects stir in the shade of the dense 
cover, day or night, and blossoms lend a rainbow cast to the carpeting grass. A 
green-flowered ginseng plant has been planted here. A red elm tree grows here, 
its branches gently swaying in the breeze. A low-slung myrrh bush is here. A 
low-lying wild ginger plant is growing here. A purple coneflower grows here, its
large stalk straining towards the sky. A lobelia wildflower is growing here. A 
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A large beehive hangs down from 
the trees above. A slimy sea cucumber is here. An ivory lily bobs at the surface
of a small pond of crystal-clear water, marking the placement of a shrine to 
Kastalia. A small Lupine plinth stands here in harmony with nature. A ladder of 
long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A mighty 
earth golem stands guard here. Elegant and refined, a golden mare delicately 
noses the ground for food. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head 
impatiently. Standing proudly, a forestal portal is here. Captain Delphinus 
Windancer, the Gatecrasher is here. He wields a sharpened quarterstaff in both

You quickly utter "Duanathar" and your wings attempt to swiftly carry you far

On the clouds.
A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. 
Resting on the ground is a cube-shaped silver sigil. Standing still as a statue,
a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. 
Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. The bizarre form of 
a chimera stands here, flickering its wings. A sharp-toothed gremlin is here, 
hopping from foot to foot. Furiae, a sable megachiropteran, whirs quietly here, 
wings at rest. Dominatus Mirko de Soulis is here. He wields a hunter's spear in 
his left hand and a kite shield in his right. Chantrelle Khisan-Foo, Forest's 
Nightingale is here. Ivory Tempest Entaro Windsong, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. 
He wields an ornate steel rapier in his left hand and a bard's flute in his 
right. Sir Goryllin Dawyn, Senator of Cyrene is riding on an alabaster pegasus.

its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Furiae, a sable 
megachiropteran, whirs quietly here, wings at rest. Ivory Tempest Entaro 
Windsong, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his 
left hand and a bard's flute in his right. Chantrelle Khisan-Foo, Forest's 
Nightingale is here. Dominatus Mirko de Soulis is here. He wields a hunter's 
spear in his left hand and a kite shield in his right.

wheeling and banking in pursuit of its meal. A ladder of long, soft leaves

cube-shaped silver sigil. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed 
its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Wings folded against his 
back, Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Eyes 
flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and
hovers close to its master's side. Furiae, a sable megachiropteran, whirs

On the clouds. (Skies)
You are high above the Sapience mainland with a view that is nothing short of 
outstanding. Below you are scattered clouds, and further below you see a falcon 
wheeling and banking in pursuit of its meal. A ladder of long, soft leaves 
comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Resting on the ground is a 
cube-shaped silver sigil. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed 
its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Wings folded against his 
back, Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Eyes 
flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and
hovers close to its master's side. Furiae, a sable megachiropteran, whirs 
quietly here, wings at rest. A crackling chaos orb floats and bobs here. 
Chantrelle Khisan-Foo, Forest's Nightingale is here. Ivory Tempest Entaro 
Windsong, Pontifex Fluvialis is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his 
left hand and a bard's flute in his right. Dominatus Mirko de Soulis is here. He
wields a hunter's spear in his left hand and a kite shield in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west,
northwest, up, down, and in.

its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Wings folded against his 
back, Xi'vyar, an infernal cerberus, stands here silent and still. Eyes 
flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and
hovers close to its master's side. Furiae, a sable megachiropteran, whirs 
quietly here, wings at rest. A crackling chaos orb floats and bobs here.

He is a frog-like Grook and is tall, regal, and deeply pale... too pale, as one 
who has drunk deeply of wrath and war. His smile is easy and quick, flashing out
at all who pass by. His nose is thin and flat, in consequence of many facial 
blows from monks. A heavily tattooed right arm fidgets back and forth between a 
relaxed stance and an array of martial gear thrust carelessly into his belt. His
head is shaved and gleams dully reflecting back any light in the surroundings. 
Blackened is his fist, as though he has passed it through fire and singed it 
deeply, tainting the flesh. His clothes are clearly chosen with an eye to 
functionality, not flash. It is obvious from his carriage that he has been a 
wielder of blades. He is muscled, but not unusually good-looking. His 
friendliness is easily seen, as is his quick anger. All this is but exterior 
however, and you can see that many dark and frightening secrets lurk within his 
mind. His eyes sparkle with a constant amusement, as one who understands hidden 
meanings behind all he sees. He is wearing 4 simple bone rings, 2 plain platinum
rings, goggles of whitesight, a suit of scale mail, a Ceylonese ring, a wyrmskin
pack, a Stygian pendant, a ring of pestilence, a ring of the Magus, a glittering
ring of vitality, a quiver, a pair of eagle's wings, an Aldar Diadem, Pixies' 
Boots, a buckawn's amulet, a Sash of Wisdom, a Girdle of the Titans, Robes of 
the Magi, a Collar of Diablerie, a Ceylonese bracelet, a deck of Tarot cards, a 
Hood of the Sphinx, and a Circlet of the Will. A rune shaped like a mighty oak 
has been sketched onto him.

Clouds stretch out underneath, some stretches mere flecks of foam, others lush, 
thick banks of pristine white. Through the gauzy layers of condensed moisture, 
the dizzying variety of the landscape of Sapience can be seen. Like a brilliant 
oblong sapphire, the southern expanse of Lake Vundamere glistens below. Furiae, 
a sable megachiropteran, whirs quietly here, wings at rest. A crackling chaos 
orb floats and bobs here. Wings folded against his back, Xi'vyar, an infernal 
cerberus, stands here silent and still. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a 
bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's

ornate steel rapier in his left hand and a bard's flute in his right. Chantrelle
