blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The waters here have been 
miraculously parted.</font><font color="#C0C0C0"> Constructed of wrought iron and monumental white marble, 
the inner gates leading into the city of Shallam stand untarnished by the ages. 
Graven upon the marble faces are intricate eastern designs and set with 
semi-precious stones, the royal seal and a crescent moon are at the centre. 
Ornamental fig trees and tea roses line the road leading through the gates, and 
fine silver and gold silks drape from the walls to catch the breeze. Above the 
gates on either side, two small turrets contain the stern-faced city guards who 
control them.</font><font color="#008080"> A runic </font><font color="#00FF00">totem</font><font color="#008080"> is planted in the ground. A cute little humgii is 
sitting here placidly, attached to a leash. Someone's valuable personal journal 
has been carelessly left behind here. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped 
sigil. A blue-bordered banner hangs down from the gates, displaying a mighty 
victory of the Light. A metal bucket is here. The statuesque form of a white 
marble gargoyle looms here. Pericles, Captain of the Shallamese Guard stands 
here, an expression of pure vigilance worn on his face. A huge statue of the 
Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.</font><font color="#00FFFF"> Brother Synbios, Sentaari
Pilgrim is here. He wields a steel Theran broadsword in each hand.
