North of New Thera (road). (Central Wilderness)
The world is a slate of white, heavy snow. The great highway stretches north and
southeast across the land, while a smaller, more poorly kept road connects to it
from the southwest. This road is the link through the Black Forest and beyond 
into the Savannah, Dakhota Hills, and finally the formidable Mhojave Desert. A 
frequent rendezvous place, the highway margins are trampled and the grasses 
flattened by the many beings who meet here. Debris often litters the place until
blown away by the gusty winds. There are 3 cube sigils here. A small wooden 
lottery box stands here. A polished wooden sign is nailed to a small tree here. 
A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver\'s Fern along the ground. 
The Red Dragon Geraint\'s imposing form looms. The Blue Dragon Santar\'s imposing 
form looms.
You see exits leading north, southeast, south, southwest, and northwest.

He is a Blue Dragon, immense and powerful. Mighty wings jut from a huge, scaled 
back, and a large sinuous tail trails off his hindquarters. Four powerful limbs 
terminating in deadly-looking claws support its massive, scaled body, but the 
most impressive feature of this most impressive being is the proud, regal head. 
A long, flattened snout sports row upon row of razor-sharp teeth, and the glint 
in his saucer-sized eyes speaks of an ancient and formidable intellect.

Sunny glen. (Aureliana Forest)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Into the
airiness of a circled little clearing spills the widened road of packed and 
beaten earth as it twines its way through the heart of the forest north to 
south. Swaying leaves in verdant hues shade the rim of an emerald grassed knoll 
where wildflowers frame the path and lend bright splashes of colour beneath the 
bowl of the sky, which lofts above where the forest\'s canopy parts enough for it
to be seen. A low-slung myrrh bush is here. A purple coneflower grows here, its 
large stalk straining towards the sky. A lobelia wildflower is growing here. A 
low-lying wild ginger plant is growing here. A green-flowered ginseng plant has 
been planted here. A red elm tree grows here, its branches gently swaying in the
breeze. A rune that looks like a stick man has been sketched into the ground 
here. A large beehive hangs down from the trees above. The Red Dragon Geraint\'s 
imposing form looms.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, south, southwest, west, and 
northwest.
