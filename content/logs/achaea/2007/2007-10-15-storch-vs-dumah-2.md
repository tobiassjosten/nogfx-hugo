A snowy war horse stands here, stamping impatiently. A mottled Mhojave desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. 
Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes 
curiously with beady black eyes. Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A grumpy 
badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a 
cunning glint of the eye. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Silver Sabre Storch, the 
Fallen Avenger is riding on a snowy white riodian war horse. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.
