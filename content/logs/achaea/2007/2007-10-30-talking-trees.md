He is a Chaos Lord and is covered with creamy white and brown bark giving his 
young, supple exterior an overall molted appearance. His large branches look 
dangerous, but no malice radiates from him.  Moss covers his root like feet. His
eyes, painted to look little more than gnarled knots, sparkle with a keen gaze 
about his surroundings.  Standing at only five and a half feet in height he 
resembles a large sycamore, his branch-like wooden covered arms appear strong, 
yet he appears to be, for the most part, not a visually aggressive creature.  
His bark and vibrant yet incomplete foliage flutters gently in the breeze, the 
broad and flat leaves sheltering his face beneath them. Though slightly 
resembling a Mhun, he has an expanded skull and a sunken chest and is covered 
with bumpy skin.
He is wearing:
 a deck of Tarot cards,
 a canvas backpack,
 a suit of scale mail,
 a ring of pestilence,
 simple suede sandals,
 a treekin costume,
 a set of vampire's fangs, and
 a large black ribbon

Zech empties out a mahogany vial into his mouth.

You blink.

You say in a quiet voice, "Did that tree just drink?"

You scratch your head in confusion.

Zech , creaking and crackling, sways back and forth stretching his branched arms
to the sky. Shaking lightly, beautifully colored leaves release themselves from 
his branches and descend upon you.

Ashley says in a sadistic, purring voice, "What tree?"

You point accusingly at Zech.

You say in a quiet voice, "That tree... it just drank a vial."

Ashley says in a sadistic, purring voice, "Oh that's just Zech, ignore him."

You say in a quiet voice, "...you guys name your trees?"

Zech says with a treekin accent, "What!"

You have emoted: Nyseia quickly jumps back.

Zech says with a treekin accent, "Why just ignore my I was having fun."

The corners of Zech's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

Ashley says in a sadistic, purring voice, "It's not a tree, it's a person."

Ashley rolls her eyes.

You say in a quiet voice, "Looks like a tree to me..."

Zech says with a treekin accent, "A very mutated one."

Ashley says in a sadistic, purring voice, "Psh."

You say in a quiet voice, "A mutated tree.... joy."

Zech says with a treekin accent, "Hey."
