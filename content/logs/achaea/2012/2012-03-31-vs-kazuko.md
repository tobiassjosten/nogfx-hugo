5596h, 4316m, 26034e, 20875w cexkdb-
Kazuko exhales loudly.
Kazuko dashes off the clarion call of the wanderer, summoning his harmonics to him.
5596h, 4218m, 26034e, 20872w cexkdb-
Kazuko says, "Begin."
5596h, 4203m, 26054e, 20869w cexkdb-
With a flourish of your arm, you bow deeply.
5596h, 4113m, 26060e, 20872w cexkdb-

5596h, 4796m, 26080e, 20872w cexkdb-
Kazuko's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
Kazuko viciously jabs a quillblade rapier into your right arm.
You watch, in horror, as your left arm shrivels up and becomes useless.
A bell-like tone rings out from Kazuko's rapier, echoed by the sound of cracking bone as your right arm snaps painfully.
5005h, 4796m, 26080e, 20872w cexkdb-8-

5005h, 4796m, 26080e, 20872w cexkb-14-
Using a heavy tremolo Kazuko crushes your left leg.
The songbird upon Kazuko's shoulder sings a graceful maqam of el'Jazira at you, and you feel suddenly clumsy in comparison.

The bones in your right arm mend.
5005h, 4796m, 26080e, 20872w cexkb-14-
First faintly, and then full force, the notes of Kazuko's harmonics respond to his call.
5005h, 4796m, 26080e, 20872w cexkb-14-
You are carrying 191 gold sovereigns.

You cannot see that being here.
5596h, 4562m, 26106e, 20843w cekdb-14-
You have no amnesia.
5596h, 4562m, 26106e, 20843w cekdb-14-

Kazuko lightly strikes the side of your head with his rapier, restoring your hearing.

Entrance to a forest. (Forest of Solitude)
A thin dirt path leads into and out of a forest here. The soil itself is firm yet the many scattered rocks make it uncomfortable for some to traverse. The trees appear to be scattered more infrequently here than within the forest glade and the flowers thrive in the sunlight that easily makes its way through the forest canopy. A thick blanket of grass covers much of the ground surrounding the path, only thinning as it rises up the hill to the northwest.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and northwest.

Beautiful garden.
Tiny songbirds can be heard chirping in a sweet melody, while barely discernable movement in the forest suggests the presence of other small animals. As a gentle breeze passes through the area, the leaves rattle in a melodic rhythm of their own, sounding much like the soft beat of lightly falling rain. The sweet scent of wildflowers looms here with an uncountable number of the iridescent flowers lining the ground. A stream lightly tumbles over a pile of rocks before coming to rest in a shallow pool. This area exudes peace and would make even the most heartless of warriors almost joyous by simply standing here. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Kazuko is here. He wields a quillblade rapier in his left hand and a green glass flute in his right.
You see exits leading north and west.

Forest off the path. (Oops, we're lost) (Forest of Solitude?)
Just off the path, the trees seem to rise up to meet those that pass this way. The entire area appears lined with wildflowers. Upon glancing your eyes catch even more of the plantlife sprouting from between the large oaks that rest here. A smell of vibrant life permeates the air, as the delicate scents of soft soil, wildflowers, trees and nearby water infuse the air with a most divine and natural perfume. To the east the scenery seems to become even more lush as the trees part just enough to allow a tiny glimpse of the area.
You see exits leading east, west, and northwest.

Lightning-quick, Kazuko jabs your right arm with a quillblade rapier.
You watch, in horror, as your left arm shrivels up and becomes useless.
A bell-like tone rings out from Kazuko's rapier, echoed by the sound of cracking bone as your right arm snaps painfully.
4806h, 3332m, 26287e, 16327w cexkb-100-

5301h, 2067m, 26307e, 16247w cexkdb-100-
You drop to the floor and sweep your legs round at Kazuko.

Kazuko lightly strikes the side of your head with his rapier.

Kazuko's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
Lightning-quick, Kazuko jabs you with a quillblade rapier.
You feel a tightening sensation grow in your lungs.
The songblessing unleashes a stunning percussive blast.

Kazuko lightly strikes the side of your head with his rapier.
4749h, 2137m, 26116e, 10669w cexkb-100-
His eyes gleaming, Kazuko smiles and quickly sings a jaunty limerick at you.
4749h, 2137m, 26116e, 10669w cexkb-100-
You are too stunned to be able to do anything.
4749h, 2137m, 26116e, 10669w cexkb-100-
The dark Lament pervades your being as you cry out in fear.
4749h, 2137m, 26116e, 10669w cexkb-100-
The Anthem shifts, protecting from psychic damage.
4749h, 2137m, 26116e, 10669w cexkb-100-
Kazuko takes a long drag off his oaken pipe.

You are no longer stunned.
5028h, 2137m, 26122e, 10675w cexkb-100-
You eat a piece of kelp.
Your bronchial tubes open up and your asthma is cured.
5028h, 2137m, 26122e, 10675w cexkb-100-
You inhale deeply, allowing the air to fill your mighty lungs.

You cannot do that because both of your arms must be whole and unbound.

5028h, 2037m, 26130e, 10675w cekb-100-
Forest off the path. (Forest of Solitude)
Kazuko sways to and fro here, unpredictably. He wields a quillblade rapier in his left hand and a green glass flute in his right.
You see exits leading east, west, and northwest.
5028h, 2037m, 26130e, 10675w cekb-100-

You cannot be bothered to do that, it is too boring.
4365h, 1845m, 26130e, 10672w cexkb-100-
You inhale deeply and begin holding your breath.
4365h, 1845m, 26130e, 10672w cexkb-100-
You cease holding your breath and exhale loudly.
You take out some salve and quickly rub it on your arms.
The bones in your right arm mend.
4365h, 1845m, 26130e, 10672w cexkb-100-
The Bagatelle strikes a sharp, piercing note, and you cry out in sudden pain.

You may drink another health or mana elixir or tonic.
4102h, 1845m, 26130e, 10672w cexkb-100-
My friend, clearly you know little of the sultry tango, if you think that you can perform it without a partner.
4102h, 1845m, 26150e, 10672w cexkb-100-
You wouldn't want to drink a salve. It would not be tasty at all.
4302h, 1695m, 26150e, 10642w cexkb-100-
