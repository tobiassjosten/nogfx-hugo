High above the clouds.
A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A vicious death adder

You nod gravely at your Guardian Angel, whose wings flare suddenly as an alien 
and frightening look of power sweeps across her face. With one hand, she reaches
forward and as her hand touches Hellrazor Cain Aristata, Mhaldorian Warlord 
chest, it flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters his breast. The Angel\'s
eyes roll back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Hellrazor Cain 
Aristata, Mhaldorian Warlord body. Cain collapses without a sound; his body now 
nothing more than a useless husk.
You have slain Cain.
Golden sovereigns spill onto the ground from Cain\'s corpse.
