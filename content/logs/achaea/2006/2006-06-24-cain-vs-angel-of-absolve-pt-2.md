You bid your guardian angel to seek out the lifeforce of Hellrazor Cain 
Aristata, Dragonslayer.
Your guardian angel senses Hellrazor Cain Aristata, Dragonslayer at Dusty road 
before the gate of Thera, on a health of 3789 and a mana of 760.
He has no companions.

5306h, 4115m, 19214e, 17800w cexkdb-
You step through a fiery portal.
Dusty road before the gate of Thera.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Some graffiti has been 
scrawled here. It reads, "Happy Logosmas, from Ruishimo!" Busily involved in the
serious business of being young, a child plays intently. Floating in the air is 
a fiery portal. Hellrazor Cain Aristata, Dragonslayer is here, hidden. He wields
a Lupine bow in his left hand.
You see exits leading north and south.
Your guardian angel informs you that she senses Hellrazor Cain Aristata, 
Dragonslayer is in this room.
5306h, 4115m, 19214e, 17800w cexkdb-
You nod gravely at your Guardian Angel, whose wings flare suddenly as an alien 
and frightening look of power sweeps across her face. With one hand, she reaches
forward and as her hand touches Hellrazor Cain Aristata, Dragonslayer chest, it 
flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters his breast. The Angel's eyes roll
back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Hellrazor Cain Aristata, 
Dragonslayer body. Cain collapses without a sound; his body now nothing more 
than a useless husk.
You have slain Cain.
A starburst tattoo flares and bathes Cain in red light.
A death adder falls from Cain's person.
Some bayberry bark falls from Cain's person.
A length of rope falls from Cain's person.
