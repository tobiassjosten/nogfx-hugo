The thunderous voice of Pentharian resonates across the realm, "Years ago, the beacon of goodness and hope was destroyed. The Chrysalis Basilica was engulfed in an inferno that destroyed all within it and left the Paladins and Priest without a home."

The thunderous voice of Pentharian resonates across the realm, "After countless attempts by the forces of Evil, Chaotic and Dark siblings, I was forced to move the reconstruction of the Basilica to a plane out of the reach of their minions and their divine influence."

The thunderous voice of Pentharian resonates across the realm, "It has been hidden from them, but the time for hiding is no more. The Chrysalis Basilica has been reconstructed and improved and will take its rightful home in Shallam once more."

The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Egads, Pentharian. I don't recall giving any of My children orders to keep the re-construction down. Are you getting paranoid on Me?"

The thunderous voice of Pentharian resonates across the realm, "Yes brother, I do not expect ye to admit to it."

The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Aww. Why would I admit to something I didn't do? I do believe you are indeed getting quite paranoid."

You notice a large ball of light shoot into the sky above Shallam, leaving a trail of sparkles in its wake. It stops abruptly and begins to slowly pulse, causing the sky above the city to shimmer and falter as if it was a lake that had just been struck by a pebble.

The tempo of the pulsing increases until you are forced to shield your eyes from the glow radiating from the gem.

The divine voice of Gaia rings out from the forests of Achaea, "Really Twilight, must you rain on everyone's parade? Don't you have Children to order about or something?"

A weak male voice shouts, "Begone, Lord Twilight!"

A stream of crackling blue fire sizzles across the sky. Rayvn has been slain by the might of Lord Twilight Trismegistus.

A resounding explosion rips across the heavens as the sky above Shallam is ripped apart, giving birth to a enormous magical gate. Winged being flit all about the rim of the portal, armed with flamed trimmed blades and quivers of arrows strung across their backs.

As you look on, the form of Pentharian followed by Lorielan can be seen rising from the from Shallam to stop before the great rift.

The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Delicious. Thank you Rayvn, that is just what I was looking to do. You have provided this ancient God with much amusement."

His arms outstretched, Pentharian casually makes a beckoning motion toward the portal and you watch in awe as the morning sun slowly become a kaleidoscope of colors as the magnificent Chrysalis Basilica comes forth from the gate.

The two Divine beings nonchalantly stride across the sky, the great mass of glass and stone in tow behind them before finally stopping before the site of the old Basilica. With a broad smile, Pentharian nods at the structure and it falls upon the crater, landing lightly and removing all semblance of it ever being there.

The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Great work Pentharian and Lorielan. Now perhaps you can begin to do what you are supposed to be doing and save the world from "Evil"."

The divine voice of Gaia rings out from the forests of Achaea, "Rayvn, I suggest you learn to speak to the Gods with respect. I find it rather distasteful when I am forced to defend that particular Brother."
