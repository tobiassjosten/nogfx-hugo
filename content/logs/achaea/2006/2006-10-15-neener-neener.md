Junction in the Arena path (road).
Slabs of smooth granite have been set upon the dry ground to form a solid road,creating an even path 

through the otherwise rocky soil. Upturned dirt and stones line the trail, churned up during countless 

battles along the barren 
road. Several patches of tall grass struggle to survive nearby, carving out a 
meek existence in the loose earth. Gentle breezes drift across the road 
occasionally, stirring the sparse grass.
You see exits leading south and northwest.

Oak Forest Glade.
The land and plantlife here has been blackened and burned. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched 
into the ground here. A snowy war horse stands here, stamping impatiently. A swarm of bees hovers 
menacingly nearby. A light horse lingers here, pawing at the ground. A blue-banded falcon flies just above 
you here. Piercing the area around him with his cunning amber glare, a massive peregrine falcon with 
razor-sharp talons is perched here. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes 
on some movement in the distance. Hermes, the Messenger is here, fiddling with a deck of golden playing 
cards. He wields the strings of Fate and Luck in His right hand. You see exits leading north, northeast, 
west, and northwest.
You are transported by the power of the Divine.

Hermes moves in towards you in a grabbing posture.
Hermes lifts you triumphantly into the air, then yanks you down into His raised

Hermes moves in towards you in a grabbing posture.
Hermes lifts you triumphantly into the air, then yanks you down into His raised
knee with back breaking force.
With a sickening crunch, a bolt of pure agony erupts from your back. Your head 
lolls to one side and you lose all the feeling in your legs. As you crumple to 
the ground you realise that the throw did, indeed, snap your spine like a dry 
twig.
You have been slain by Hermes.
You are OUT of the rampage game!
