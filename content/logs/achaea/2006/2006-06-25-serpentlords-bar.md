(Serpentlords): Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Oh my, I've gotten some very 
disturbing news."
 (Serpentlords): Celania says, "Ooh."
 (Serpentlords): Celania says, "What?"
 (Serpentlords): Glint says, "Uh oh."
 (Serpentlords): Glint says, "Hello there ssathis."
 (Serpentlords): You say, "Problems Mistress?"
Library.
Writhing slowly from side to side, Ssathis, the Ophidian, is here. Nestled 
against the far wall, a carved jade bookcase seems to glow in the reflected 
light. An onyx scaled viper lies here, a small collar secured around its neck. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, 
rectangular monolith is on the ground. An obsidian eye sigil is here. An oak 
bookshelf is here. There are 2 black chairs with a covering of leather here. An 
oak desk is here. Glittery Glint, Nightshadow of the Cult is here, shimmering 
with a ghostly light.
Glint bows respectfully to you.
You bow respectfully to Ssathis, the Ophidian.
 (Serpentlords): Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "I would rather not say over here."
 (Serpentlords): Grok says, "Shall we come to thee?"
Glittery Glint, Nightshadow of the Cult says, "What wrong Ssathis?"
 (Serpentlords): You say, "I will speak with you in person if you wish mistress?"
Celania arrives from the east.
Celania bows respectfully to Ssathis, the Ophidian.
You say to Ssathis, the Ophidian, "Problems Mistress?"
&lt;&lt;Serpentlords&gt;&gt;: Grok says, "-scratch-."
&lt;&lt;Serpentlords&gt;&gt;: Celania says, "Ssshhh. -hum-."
Ssathis, the Ophidian nibbles on her fingernails absentmindedly.
Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "News from somebody I've not heard from."
Celania raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You say, "Is there anything we can do to help Ssathis?"
Drazik doffs his hat cordially at Ssathis, the Ophidian.
Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "A note, I fear the worst."
Ssathis, the Ophidian creases her brow in a frown.
Glittery Glint, Nightshadow of the Cult says to Ssathis, the Ophidian, "Whats 
wrong dear?"
Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "His serpent, it had to be his, delivered it."
Celania Windsong says, "Whose?"
You say, "Oh."
Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Whose? I said already didn't I?"
You say, "No mistress.. you have not."
Celania looks about herself, rubbing her chin thoughtfully.
Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "I could have sworn."
 (Brood): You say, "Appologies lil ones.. our House tutor is in distress."
Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Why, it's my brother's."
Comprehension flashes across Celania's face.
You say, "You have heared from you family?"
Ssathis, the Ophidian nibbles on her fingernails absentmindedly.
Ssathis, the Ophidian gives a crumpled note to you.

You read what is written on a crumpled note:
No time
Caught beastmen
Search base
Free me
Dupe fake

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Maybe you can make sense of it."

You say, "Your brothers been captured?"
Celania ruffles her wingfeathers quickly and then smooths them again.
Celania Windsong says, "Uh oh."
Grok arrives from the east.
With a flourish of his arm, Grok bows deeply.

You say, "Caught beastmen."

You say, "Search base."

Celania Windsong says, "Beast cultists."

Elnador Danial says, "Maybe."

Drazik looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

You say, "Where Ophidians come from."

Celania Windsong says, "I'll bet you."

You say, "I think we may have to go on a rescue mission."

Elnador nods her head emphatically.

Grok projects a net of light about himself and you watch as his image becomes 
faded and ghostly.

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "He's somewhat of a collector, if you get my 
meaning."


The corners of your mouth turn up as you grin mischievously.

Ssathis, the Ophidian gives a pained sigh.

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Not as good he should have been."

You say, "Who knows the rock well?"

You say, "Where the beast cultists are?"
Elnador Danial says, "I know my way around it.."
Grok makes an "iffy" motion with his hand.

You say, "Elnador.. you get to lead.. Grok can correct if needed.. Ssathis has 
served us for years.. it is time we helped repay the debt."

Celania Windsong says, "I can go easy."

Celania peers about herself unscrupulously.

You begin to follow Elnador.

Elnador makes a beckoning motion to no one in particular.

The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage says to you, "What is our mission?"

A nearly invisible magical shield forms around Glint.

You say, "Everyone follow elnador."

Glittery Glint, Nightshadow of the Cult says, "What for?"

You say to Grok, "To rescue Ssathis brother."

Elnador Danial says, "That everybody?"

Glint clenches his fist and chortles "Ooer!"

The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage says, "Named?"


You say, "The beast cultists appear to have him."

You see The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage yell, "Worry not brother. We
are here to save you."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist scowls miserably.

You say, "Okay.. we need to find a male ophidian."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "What do you want?"

Grok smirks.

You say to Bearnath, the Beast Cultist, "We seek a male Ophidian, a brother of a
friend of ours."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist snorts arrogantly.

Drazik tells you in Mhun, "-hum-."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "There are many male Ophidian in this place. 
The grottos are filthy with them."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Glint.. ask ssathis her brothers name."

Celania Windsong rattles: We're not getting anything out of the Cultists. I say 
we head down there and take a LOOK at em all.

You nod your head at Celania.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "Is that why you disturbed my ritual?"

Elnador tells you, "What was the strange two words that were written on the 
note?"

You tell Elnador Danial, "Dupe fake."

Ancient Drazik Thorondor rattles: Ophidians look fnormal.

Celania Windsong says, "Your ritual has never worked, and never will, Bearnath."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist peers about himself unscrupulously.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "What's all that noise you're making?"

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "This time it would have, if only he 
hadn't..."

Elnador Danial says to Bearnath, the Beast Cultist, "Who hadn't what?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Hope some jackass doesn't decide to go 
"Bashing"."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "Nothing you need to worry about."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist smirks.

You say, "Perhaps it is the answer to all our problems."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Elnador Danial rattles: Maybe we should force it out of him?

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "Why should I care about your problems?"

You say, "Who interupted you? perhaps we can assist you?"

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist smirks.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "You can not assist me. We have tried 
everything to get it out of him."

You say, "We have different tactics, less brute strength."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist scowls miserably at Legalenydd.

You say, "This name means something to you?"

The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage rattles: Zisloth - the male 
ophidian's name.

Glint tells you, "Send me the note."

Legalenydd leaves to the east.

Celania Windsong rattles: Indeed.

Glint tells you, "Well tell me what it says."


You read what is written on a crumpled note:
No time

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist eyes the gathered crowd warily, inching back a bit 
while one hand rests on his dagger.

Celania chuckles long and heartily.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "There are many of you searching for just one 
man."

Celania Windsong says, "Indeed."

You tell Glittery Glint, Nightshadow of the Cult, "No time, caught beastmen,

the day that Fate would shine favorably upon his deepest desires, and let him 
cross the path of the most gracious Katia."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "-hum- And I'm stealing the REST of bearnath's 
stuff too."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "He is caged, but I will not tell you where 
until you retrieve it for me. It is not on his person when we caught up with 
him."

Aust says, "Wow."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist grins as a mad gleam flickers into his eyes.

Celania begins to breathe deeply, her muscles tensed and ready for action.

Aust says, "Planning on kiling bearnath?"

You say, "Where was he captured?"

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist cuffs Aust upside his head.

You say to Aust, "No."

Aust says, "Ow!"

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist opens a gash in Aust's arm with a skillful blow.

You say, "Thats the lil one who hunts giller.. someone deal with him later."

Celania nods her head emphatically.

Elnador Danial says, "I will."

suspiciously.

Celania Windsong says, "Where "above"?"

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "He refused to tell us where he had hidden 
it."

You say, "So he has hidden it somewhere along the way."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist scowls miserably.

Ancient Drazik Thorondor says, "Every good thief has a good fence."

(Serpentlords): Glint says, "Grr."

You say to Legalenydd, "Please leave."

Durgon tells you, "What is going on? Everyone is all panicy about something, and
I want to help!"

Legalenydd asks, "Why?"

Celania snaps her fingers in front of Legalenydd.

Legalenydd leaves to the east.

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Suggest action E, sleep."

(Serpentlords): Elnador says, "Good one."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I looove my ob."

You tell Broodling Durgon, "We need to find a gem in the great rock.. to 
exchange for a friend."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Job, that is."

Elnador moves over to block the east exit.

Celania shakes her head at Elnador.

Legalenydd crosses his arms, standing firm and resolute.

Celania rolls her eyes.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist scrutinizes Legalenydd cautiously, studying him for 
possible danger.

A whip comes speeding in, wraps itself around Legalenydd, and speeds back out, 
unable to move him.

Legalenydd says, "Don't do that."

A whip comes speeding in, wraps itself around Legalenydd, and speeds back out, 
unable to move him.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "If we can not find it, what makes you think 
you can?"

Celania Windsong says, "We have other resources, Bearnath."

You say, "We are serpents.. we can find much that is hidden."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist scowls miserably.

Legalenydd is violently ripped from your location by a magical summoning.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "How did you know he was captured?"

You say, "Again.. we have our ways."

Celania nods her head at you.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

(Serpentlords): Glint says, ""Just the note"."

Durgon tells you, "Oh... is that bad?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Hmm."

(Serpentlords): You say, "The notes empty."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Can the snake lead us back, perhaps?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "-chin-."

You say, "What does the gem look like sir?"

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "You will know it when you find it."

Durgon tells you, "Does he request a sacrifice? If so, I will gladly lay my life
down for a friend!"

You tell Broodling Durgon, "No.. he wants a gem."

Elnador Danial says to Bearnath, the Beast Cultist, "You aren't giving us a lot 
of help."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Damn.. just says we will know it when we find it."

Durgon tells you, "Why? And where is it? I shall aid in the search!"

(Serpentlords): Glint says, "Hmm."

-rattle okay.. it's gotta be round here somewhere.. 

You rattle out your message.

You say, "Where abouts did you capture him?"

(Serpentlords): You say, "See if he can make a fake magic gem.."

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "What about Constantine?"

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "Up above, he was clambering over the rock."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "You can try 'im, but I'm seeing if Aquetane can 
do anything."

You say to Elnador, "You know the way?"

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "Okay, I'll go see Constatine."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Then there de'burr."

Elnador nods her head emphatically.

*searching spam… realisation in ht that the note said search base.. base of statue searched.. *

A barren stone base slides across the ground easily, revealing a sparkling 
emerald.

"Ahah!" Drazik exclaims triumphantly.

Celania nods her head emphatically.

Elnador Danial says, "Where was it?"

Celania waves about a perfectly-cut emerald energetically.

Celania Windsong says, "Push base."

The corners of your mouth turn up as you grin mischievously.

Elnador Danial exclaims, "I tried that!"

You say, "Lets get a fake made."

Celania shrugs helplessly.

Celania Windsong says, "Needed the right touch."

Elnador slumps down dejectedly.

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "TO DEBURR!"

You give a trillingly melodic laugh.

You tell Celania Windsong, "Get a fake made.. hide the real one."

(Serpentlords): Reptilios says, "What's going on?"

(Serpentlords): You say, "Told you.. ssathis brother was captured."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "We're being sneaky basttards."

(Serpentlords): Grok says, "Ssathis has commisioned us to find her brother who 
has been imprisioned by Bearnath."

Elnador Danial says, "Lets go back to Bearnath."
You shake your head.

You say, "Not till celania is back."

You say, "Looks too dodgy."

Elnador puts her hands on her hips and goes "Hmmm!"

Elnador nods her head emphatically.

Durgon tells you, "Hows the search going? I could aid the efforts if you wished 
it."

You tell Broodling Durgon, "We have found it.. we are making afake."

You tell Celania Windsong, "Is it working?"

Celania tells you, "Talking."

Durgon tells you, "But the villain must be punished for his crimes, will we take
action?"
(Serpentlords): Celania says, "-evilgrin-."

(Serpentlords): Glint says, "Find 'm?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Seeing if I can get a green glass copy."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Ahh."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "THAT is why I feel evil."

Protecting his beloved butterflies, Vellis, the butterfly collector has taken 
the life of Cain.

Elnador rolls on the floor, laughing.

Elnador rolls on the floor, laughing.

You give a trillingly melodic laugh.

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Where's the theran glassblower?"

(Serpentlords): You say, "I dunno.. didn't know there was one."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I got it."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Woot."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Got to Holly."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Let's see if she's up to it."

(Serpentlords): You say, "How goes in thera?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Gold may be required."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Anything you pay.. i'll repay."

(Serpentlords): You say, "How much?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "We're seeing."

(Serpentlords): Grok says, "Celania, holly's incentive is to do it now or die 
:P."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Psh."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I'm nice."

(Serpentlords): You say, "*chuckle*."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Sides."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I can get her to do it again."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "-hum-."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Steal the fake, resell it to Bearnath, repeat."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "-inno-."

(Serpentlords): You say, "*chuckle*."

Elnador Danial says, "Steal a fake of a stolen gem.."

Elnador snickers softly to herself.

(Serpentlords): You say, "*bounce* hurry up.. I feel like a kid again.. i want 
it. and i want it now!"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Negotiations procede apace."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Excellent."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Now with flattery."

(Serpentlords): You say, "*chuckle* now with added flatery."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Ah, I'm working it."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Please hold your pants on."

(Serpentlords): Reptilios says, "*bites tongue*."

(Serpentlords): Grok says, "-grabs his dress tightly at it's fringes-."

(Serpentlords): Reptilios says, "Sooo tempting to comment."

(Serpentlords): You say, "No pants.. will hold my dress on."

*bored of loitering on rock.. head to holly in thera*


Celania nods her head emphatically.

Celania beckons you to her.

Grok tells you, "Pacing on - follow celania."
You begin to follow Celania.

Celania tells you, "Holly, the Theran glassblower says, "Yes yes I see, now if 
you'll excuse me. I need concentration to work.""

(Serpentlords): Glint says, "Katia's brother okay?"

(Serpentlords): Glint says, "Er uh."

Celania Windsong says, "Would being quiet be enough, or must we leave?"

(Serpentlords): Glint says, "Ssathis's."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Ssathis dear.. we're working on it."

(Serpentlords): Grok says, "In process to duplicating artifact needing to 
resuce."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "-cackle-."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "We're very evil."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I hope it explodes and kills bearnath. -shifty-."

(Serpentlords): Reptilios says, "*cackle*."

(Serpentlords): You say, "If not.. we could.. kidnapping one of ours and all.. i
think we may have to declare war on the cultists."

Setting the real gem upon her workbench, Holly, the Theran glassblower begins to
manipulate a pile of white sand, and shards of coloured glass slowly.

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Sssshhhhh."

(Serpentlords): Glint says, "Ooooooo dooo iiiittt."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Be vewwy quiet, people here."
(Serpentlords): Celania says, "We're catching a wa... wait, watching a 
glassblower work."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Oh, I'm planning on killing him anyway."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "After he gives us Ssathis' bro."

(Serpentlords): Elnador says, "Hehe."

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "Um wait a sec."


(Serpentlords): Reptilios says, "Why cant we just go there, bust down all the 
walls and take him?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Cause we lack explosives."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Goodo.. once we get Zisloth."

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "If the copy is going to be so good that Bearnath 
can't tell them apart, how are we going to tell them apart?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Sides, it may keel eem."

(Serpentlords): Reptilios says, "Easy."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Hopefully holly will know."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Nod."

(Serpentlords): Reptilios says, "Get a vial of ink and write down REAL and FAKE 
on them."

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "..."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I'll just ask Holly for the real first."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Daft monkey."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Then remember it."

Repeating the previous steps, Holly picks up a pair of metal tongs and begins to
shape the molten glass.

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "That's assuming -she- knows."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "It's the one that burns your hand."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Celania.. gimme the fake one."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "-shrug-."

(Serpentlords): You say, "We'll mount the real one in the library."

Drazik tells you, "You guys are makin this toooo eaaassysyssysy."

As a fist-sized piece of emerald glass takes shape, Holly moves towards a 
slightly-charred block of wood and snaps the glass bauble from the blow tube, 
manipulating it still with her tongs and new metal tools from her belt.

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "This is kinda fun."

(Serpentlords): You say, "*grin*."

(Serpentlords): Reptilios says, "Like watching paint dry."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Shh."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I like it."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Glassblowing is cool."

With an artist's eye, Holly carefully looks between the replica and the real 
gem, manipulating it until it grows hard to tell them apart.

As her work finishes she hastily puts it into an oven-like contraption and steps
back, satisfied.

Celania's mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.

A glint of silver flashes from mighty beating wings as they rise to the 
deeply-rumbled call: Ashaxei! Pierce the Veil!

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Who got draggy?"

Holly, the Theran glassblower says, "It will just be a moment now, it needs to 
cool."

Celania nods her head emphatically.

(Serpentlords): Ora says, "Draggy?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Someone just made dragon."

(Serpentlords): Elnador says, "Yeah."

Celania looks about herself, rubbing her chin thoughtfully.

Celania grins mischievously at Holly, the Theran glassblower.

Holly, the Theran glassblower takes up both the real gem and the glass gem, 
holding them side by side.

The corners of Celania's mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

The corners of your mouth turn up as you grin mischievously.

Celania Windsong says, "Dun get em confused."

Holly, the Theran glassblower says, "Now then, the emerald is much stronger than
the other. Careful you don't scratch the glass one."

Celania nods her head emphatically.

Holly, the Theran glassblower gives a perfectly-cut emerald to Celania Windsong.

Holly, the Theran glassblower gives a perfectly-cut emerald to Celania Windsong.

Celania twitches spasmodically.

Holly, the Theran glassblower says, "And don't get confused yourself."

You say to Celania, "Gimme one."

Celania gives a perfectly-cut emerald to you.

Holly, the Theran glassblower's eyes sparkle with amusement.

Celania Windsong says, "I can tell, thanks."

This large emerald is roughly the size of a closed fist. Hundreds of flat 
surfaces are perfectly cut to give this gem the illusion of a spherical shape. 
When hit by the light, the rays are scattered through each facet of the emerald,
casting a green glow around it. Upon closer inspection, this green gem is 
lighter than it should be and the material less hardy.
It weighs 4 ounce(s).

You say, "I have the fake."

Celania nods her head emphatically.

Celania Windsong says, "Which did you want?"

You say, “ The fake.”


*run back to bearnath*

Grok moves over to block the east exit.

Celania tells you, "Go go go."

You say, "Greetings Bearnath."
Celania Windsong says, "We have your gem."

You say, "We have found your gem."

You brandish a perfectly-cut emerald menacingly.

Celania winks conspiratorially at you.

You say to Bearnath, the Beast Cultist, "We would request our friend now?"

(Serpentlords): Grok says, "Target Bearnath just incase he gets fiesty."

Grok slips behind Bearnath, the Beast Cultist and garrotes him with his whip.

Grok howls as Bearnath, the Beast Cultist hacks into him.

Celania peers at Grok unscrupulously.

(Serpentlords): Grok says, "Fuck."

You peer about yourself unscrupulously.

(Serpentlords): You say, "Heheh."

(Serpentlords): Ora says, "Ha."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Bad groky."
Serpentlords): Grok says, "Meant to glance, but i forgot the l."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "You have the gem? Well, give it here."

You say, "First.. our friend."

You say, "You can see I have the Gem."

You brandish a perfectly-cut emerald menacingly.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "You give me the gem, and I'll give you the 
key to his cell."

Celania Windsong rattles: Risk it.

You give a perfectly-cut emerald to Bearnath, the Beast Cultist.

Ancient Drazik Thorondor rattles: I dunno.

Celania Windsong rattles: We can always do the fun thing if it doesn't work.

You say, "Key."


Bearnath, the Beast Cultist gives a key to you.

You say, "Where is the cell?"
3223h, 3591m cexkb-keylist

*other keys hidden.. shifty*
Key #298524 unlocks:
   the door(s) between "Guard chamber in the Fortress of the Beast" and "A tiny

(Hashan): Stern says, "God he has a big eggo."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist says, "He's in a cell at the top of the guard's 
quarters."

Celania nods her head emphatically.


(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Checking."

You say, "Okay.. guard chamber."
You say, "Lead on."
3223h, 3591m cexkb-
Bearnath, the Beast Cultist clutches the gem tightly and begins to work upon his
ritual.

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I can't find a door U."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Key says it's in the Guard chamber in the Fortress of 
the Beast."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Lets get outta here fast."

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "Im there."

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist sways back and forth as he begins to chant beneath 
his breath.

(Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "Where's everyone meeting at?"

You follow Elnador Danial southeast to Chamber of Rituals.

You unlock the up door.


You open the door to the up.


A tiny cage.
Thick heavy chains nearly eclipse the huddled form of a caged Ophidian here. The
Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage is here, shrouded. He wields an 
iron-tipped whip in his left hand and a needled-pointed dirk in his right. 
Celania Windsong is here, shrouded. She wields an iron-tipped whip in her left

You see a single exit leading down (open door).

Number of objects: 1

Celania Windsong says, "Zisloth."

Celania Windsong says, "We come as friends."

You say to Zisloth, the Ophidian, "Oddly.. we're here to rescue you."

Celania grins mischievously at Zisloth, the Ophidian.

Grok tells you, "Close the door behind you incase."

Celania nods her head emphatically.

You close the door leading down.

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "You, you aren't the cultists."

Celania shakes her head.

Celania Windsong says, "We're... ah... a rescue party."

You say, "No.. we come from Ssathis."

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "She got the note then?"

Elnador nods her head emphatically.

The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage says to Zisloth, the Ophidian, "Your
breathern await you."

You say, "Yes.. we are the Serpentlords.. not your usual rescue team.. but we 
cope."

A low chant resonates through the darkened corridors of the Beastlord's lair. As
the crescendo of words reaches its pinnacle, the sound of tinkling glass echoes 
loudly throughout quickly after.

Celania giggles happily.

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "GOT heem."

You double over in laughter, wiping the tears from your eyes.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist yells, "What is this? A TRICK?"

Celania claps her hands together merrily.

You say, "We need to run."

(Serpentlords): Grok says, "I knew it."

Zisloth, the Ophidian blinks.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist yells, "Cultists to me!"

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "Yes, let's get out of here."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Psh, I'll keel his ass."

Zisloth, the Ophidian is not something that can be locked or unlocked.

You say, "Follow dear."

Zisloth, the Ophidian begins to follow you.

Celania Windsong says, "You go."

You say, "Lets go."

Celania Windsong says, "I'll cover you."

Celania stretches languidly.

Bearnath, the Beast Cultist yells, "Bring me those who thought to fool me!"

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "I'll help."

Celania nods her head emphatically.

Celania Windsong says, "Good."

Elnador nods her head emphatically.

Elnador Danial says, "Me too."

You open the door to the down.

Castus, Apprentice of the Spire yells, "Bearnath, be quiet!"

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "We'll cover you're escape."

You say to Elnador, "Go."


Droch Rhyst yells, "What is going on?"

The following beings are in your entourage:
Zisloth, the Ophidian#46308.
The following adventurers are in your entourage:
A ghostly presence

(Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "Where are we all at for this deal?"

Castus, Apprentice of the Spire yells, "Tall, dark, and ugly is full of hot air 
again."

(Serpentlords): Elnador says, "Ow these hurt."

(Serpentlords): Gawi says, "Hmm?"

You say to Grok, "You know the way out?"

You move about quickly and lose The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage.

You follow The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage west to Chamber of 
Rituals.


Grok pokes at you urgently.

(Serpentlords): Ora says, "I donno, Im just sitting in my house listening to ht 
and getting curious."

You follow The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage northwest to Hall of 
Summons.

Drazik slips behind Bearnath, the Beast Cultist and garrotes him with his whip.

(Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "This whole thing you guys are doing?"

You say, "Just to the seurface and we can fly."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "To me, katia."


*much movement and flying spam.. fly away.. I love my wings*

Celania Windsong says, "Hyah."

You hurl yourself forwards through the air, and sure enough a swirling vortex of
colours springs into existence to swallow you.
The wormhole spits you out at the other end.
Platform on the roof.

You strike a pose.

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "Clear the decks!"

(Serpentlords): Elnador says, "So many people are dying to them."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "We're comin THROUGH."

(Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "Where at?!"

*running through hashan.. large group of serpents.. to the estate, to see Ssathis our lovely but scary tutor *

Library.
Writhing slowly from side to side, Ssathis, the Ophidian, is here. Nestled 
against the far wall, a carved jade bookcase seems to glow in the reflected 
light. An onyx scaled viper lies here, a small collar secured around its neck. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, 
rectangular monolith is on the ground. An obsidian eye sigil is here. An oak 
bookshelf is here. There are 2 black chairs with a covering of leather here. An 
oak desk is here.
You see a single exit leading east.


(Serpentlords): Grok says, "Zisloth secure. Fall back team. Guildhall."

Grok moves over to block the east exit.

You say to Ssathis, the Ophidian, "We bought you a visitor."

Grok gives a relaxed sigh.

(Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "I'll meet you all at the Guildhall."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "We're done."

(Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "What?"

Ssathis, the Ophidian gives a horrified gasp.

(Serpentlords): You say, "Cel.. gimme the real gem."

Ssathis, the Ophidian exclaims, "You found him!"

Celania nods her head emphatically.

You say, "Of course we did."

Celania gives a perfectly-cut emerald to you.

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "Bearnath sstill ain't dead :P."

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "Sister! It's been so long."

(Serpentlords): Hawfeld says, "Ok, Hey all, what's going on and how can I help?"

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "We can go whack heem soon."

(Serpentlords): You say, "We rescued ssathis brother from the bear cultists."

Ssathis, the Ophidian looks warily at her brother, noticing the many wounds that
afflict him.

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "It has been very long, brother."

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "You sent them?"

(Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "Ooo, so that's what you were all doing?"

(Serpentlords): You say, "Yup."

(Serpentlords): Drazik says, "I think he's umm."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Yes, I did. Your snake slithered in with your 
letter, though it was very hard to read."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "What were you up to?"

(Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "Ah. Wish I could have helped."

(Serpentlords): You say, "Is bearnath pissed at us?"

Ssathis, the Ophidian's mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.

Celania grins mischievously at you.

Celania Windsong says, "Show her."

You display a perfectly-cut emerald for all in the room to see.

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "We're going to have to keep that 
safe."

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "Locked away in a vault or 
something."

Celania Windsong says, "Stick it with the other one."

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "Aha, you found the gem?"

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says to Celania, "The other one is with 
Bearnath remember."

"Oooooooooh!" Ssathis, the Ophidian says, eyes wide with wonder.

(Serpentlords): Ora says, "Wow, the house trippled in size or what?"

You say to Zisloth, the Ophidian, "And had a fake made."

Celania Windsong says, "No, our blue one."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "That is quite the treasure."

Drazik arrives from the east.

Zisloth, the Ophidian's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Ancient Drazik Thorondor says, "Umm."

Ancient Drazik Thorondor says, "I think Bearnath is still quite angry."

(Serpentlords): Celania says, "I ate Bearnath."

Celania raises her hand to her mouth and titters girlishly.

You grin mischievously at Drazik.

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "Wouldnt you be if you were duped 
and just got whooped by a bunch of serpents."

Ssathis, the Ophidian gives a trillingly melodic laugh.

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "I was right in asking you to help me, I trained you
all so well."

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "Well serves him right."

You say to Ssathis, the Ophidian, "That you did mistress."

You say, "And helping your brother was the least we could do."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "I am refusing to let you out of my sight for 
awhile, brother."

Ssathis, the Ophidian grins mischievously at you.
You grin mischievously at Ssathis, the Ophidian.

You say, "We could always find a place for you here."

Grok tells you, "Herp!"
Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "After that last job, I think I'll be retiring for 
awhile."
Serpentlord Valkyre Drake says in Hashani, "There you go, Grok."
Grok nods his head at Valkyre.

Ssathis, the Ophidian ponders the situation.

You say to Zisloth, the Ophidian, "We... have a bar that needs someone to look 
after it."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Katia, weren't you asking me about family just 
recently?"

Grok tells you, "Since ssathis moved from the Herpitorium, it's been so lonely."

Grok tells you, "Lol - or a bar."

Celania tells you, "OOC: PLEASE PLEASE give the God that did that one mad 
kudos."

Celania tells you, "OOC: That was the most fun thing I've ever done."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "What do you say, brother?"

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Stick around for awhile?"

Zisloth, the Ophidian ponders the situation.

You say, “ Would running a bar for a bunch of serpents be a suitable 
rest?"

Ancient Drazik Thorondor says, "Free cake?"

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "I'll make a deal."

You tilt your head and listen intently.


look zisloth

Very few features can be seen beneath the blood, grime, and dirt caking the 
brutalised features of a caged Ophidian. Though his clothes hang tattered upon 
his emaciated frame, an air of sarcastic amusement hangs around him, heightened 
by his twinkling yellow eyes.
Zisloth, the Ophidian appears to be extraordinarily strong.

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "I'll stay, for now. And as payment, return the gem 
to me."

You give a perfectly-cut emerald to Zisloth, the Ophidian.

You say, "Deal."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "I suppose it is rightfully yours, even after that 
wild chase you had me send them on."

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "Of course sister, you're entitled to a cut for your
help aren't you?"

Celania gives the world a smart salute.

Celania Windsong says, "That was fun."

Celania Windsong says, "Glad yer save."

Valkyre doffs his hat cordially at Celania.

Celania Windsong says, "Safe, even."

Elnador nods her head emphatically.

The corners of Ssathis, the Ophidian's mouth turn up as she grins mischievously.

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Exactly what I wanted to hear."

You chuckle long and heartily.

turn up as he grins mischievously.

Zisloth, the Ophidian says, "Now, this bar? And perhaps a change of clothes."

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "I just wish i could have been there
to see Bearnath's face when he realized the gem we gave him was glass."

Zisloth, the Ophidian's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say to Zisloth, the Ophidian, "And a bath."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "Yes. Let us get you cleaned up."

Ssathis, the Ophidian says, "We shall meet you all in the bar."

Serpentlord Valkyre Drake smiles with a wink and says in Hashani, "I could offer
my clothes, if you think they'd fit."

You nod your head at Ssathis, the Ophidian.

You give a trillingly melodic laugh.

Grok proudly shows off a black silk dress with butterfly motif:
Made from black silk, this dress leaves the arms bare. A crossed 
neckline leads to long black ribbons which tie around the neck of 
the wearer, and reach to the small of her back. Tight across breast 
and hip, the dress flares slightly at the hip, the right side 
carrying on in a dropped hem that skims the ankle, whilst the left 
side stops high on the left thigh. The long side of the skirt on 
this dress is decorated with scattered butterflies in flight, 
strangely bright against the blackness of the silk, and as the 
silk moves with the breeze, they seem to flutter slightly. 



Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says to Grok, "..."

You say, "I think his sister wishes to berate him a little."

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "I'm pretty sure he'd pass on that."

You say, "Hey.. I made that!"

Elnador rolls on the floor in front of Reptilios, laughing.

Grok winks conspiratorially at you.

Valkyre grins mischievously at Reptilios.

You move about quickly and lose Zisloth, the Ophidian.

Grok tells you, "So where's this bar at?"

You bow respectfully to Ssathis, the Ophidian.

With a flourish of her arm, Ssathis, the Ophidian bows deeply.

You say, "I will take them up the bar.. and look forward to a cleaner you."

Grok bows respectfully to Ssathis, the Ophidian.

Grok bows respectfully to Zisloth, the Ophidian.

Valkyre bows slightly and, in a fluid motion, gently takes Ssathis, the 
Ophidian's hand and brushes his lips over it.

Valkyre doffs his hat cordially at Zisloth, the Ophidian.

Grok nods his head at you.

*to the bar*
The Snake Bite Lounge.
You see a single exit leading east (open door).
You say, "The bar."

The Snake Bite Lounge.
The far wall in this large room is dominated by a large, highly-polished, curved
mirror that allows the wary to keep a watchful eye on their back. In front of 
the mirror is a semi-circular bar made of nicked oak with an elegant brass 
railing running its length. Unlabeled bottles of every colour stand with pride 
in their designated spot behind the bar, marred only by a thin layer of dust. 
Several leather stools in front of the bar provide a place to rest, and another 
handful of shorter seats are scattered throughout the room in front of low, 
rickety tables. Hidden beneath a layer of sawdust are rough, unpolished oak 
floorboards that creak faintly with every step. Sputtering torches hang from the
wall, and red crystals embedded between the flames compliment the flickering 
light with a soft glow. Hanging from one of the dark oaken walls is an 
embellished coat of arms bearing the heraldry of the Serpentlords. Reptilios 
Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry is here, shrouded. He wields a Whip of Thorns in his
right hand. The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage is here, shrouded. He 
wields an iron-tipped whip in his left hand and a needled-pointed dirk in his 
right. Elnador Danial is here, shrouded. She wields an iron-tipped whip in her 
left hand and a needled-pointed dirk in her right.
You see a single exit leading east (open door).

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "Oooo."

Comprehension flashes across Grok's face.

Elnador puts her hands on her hips and goes "Hmmm!"

Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "Coolio."

The corners of your mouth turn up as you grin mischievously.


Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says to you, "I can tell i'm going to 
spend much more time within the house estate."

You say, "I have yet to install the bar stools and tables.. as the decorators 
only finished the bar earlier."

You grin mischievously at Reptilios.
Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "People are gonna wonder where i get
all the cool drinks from though."

You nod your head emphatically.
The Mr. Grok the Insane Mistress of Carnage says, "If only would could play 
games and gamble here as well, i think we would have to install beds."
You give a trillingly melodic laugh.
 (Serpentlords): Valkyre says, "So how are we all doing, Serpents?"
Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says to Grok, "No."
The corners of Grok's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "Because then you'd want to do other
stuff here too."
Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says, "And that's just... no."
Grok raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Grok chuckles long and heartily.
Serpentlord Valkyre Drake says in Hashani, "Heh, er, forgot my book."
The corners of Valkyre's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
Grok rubs up against Reptilios affectionately.
Grok moves over to block the east exit.
Valkyre grins mischievously at Reptilios.
Reptilios gags and sputters at Grok.
Reptilios Le'Coeur, Crossroads Sentry says to you, "Save meeee."
You give a trillingly melodic laugh.
Zisloth slinks in from the east.
You flash Zisloth, the Ophidian a joyous smile.
Reptilios bows respectfully to Zisloth, the Ophidian.

-look zisloth

This tall, lean man's entire frame undulates slowly, curiously graceful. A wry 
smile dances upon his face, matched by a pair of twinkling, mischievous yellow
