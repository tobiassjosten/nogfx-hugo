Warmage of Mhaldor, Coran Nostradamus, Destroyer of Hope shouts, "If you are in
fact wondering, one of the many laughable portions of Shallam's public laws is 
the restriction of citizenship for people who use Occultism or Domination, as 
they are 'against Shallam's ideals'. You have no problem teaming with 
Occultists, but they aren't good enough to be citizens? Nice to know Shallam's 
'ideals' are so well protected."

Lady Aztecia, Starlight Serenade shouts, "Coran just make a post ok?"

Rocktamer Ta'sa's voice reverberates, "Coran, dude, seriously. Filter between 
the brain and the mouth."

Sensei Shusen Azon, Son of Violence shouts, "Hehe good one Rockie."

Warmage of Mhaldor, Coran Nostradamus, Destroyer of Hope shouts, "Rocktamer, go
team with the people who won't let you join their city some more."

Rocktamer Ta'sa's voice reverberates, "I don't think your problem is us 
teaming, I think it's that so many damn people have pk on you that they don't 
want to wait in line."

Lady Aztecia, Starlight Serenade shouts, "They are at opposite ends of the 
body, Rock. A lot of info gets lost along the way."

Vaskar Storm, Guardian of the Daisuke shouts, "Oh gods now that was great."
