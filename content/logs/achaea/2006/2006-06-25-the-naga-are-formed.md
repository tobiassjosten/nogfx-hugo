A sinister hissing echoes across through the evening breeze.

A voice rolls across the land, like a thousand hissing snakes it resounds through the firmament, 'I COMETH!'. Dread fills your being.

A shimmering curtain of multi-coloured light surrounds you for an instant as your wounds are healed by divine intervention.

A fine mist of purple rain washes over the Land, refreshing the minions of Lord Twilight.

A powerful male voice shouts, "Down with Twilight!"

The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Lucky for you, Jarik, I'm a kinder and gentler God these days."

A powerful male voice shouts, "SHould I be touched?"

A stream of crackling blue fire sizzles across the sky.
Harik has been slain by the might of Lord Twilight Trismegistus

The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Is that touched enough?"

A powerful male voice shouts, "Psh.....Jarik is inveenceeble!"

Pandora, Goddess of Mischief resonates, "You wanna test that theory kiddo?"

Pandora, Goddess of Mischief resonates, "Wanna see how invincible you are with 100 health, no grace and a bounty on your head Jarik?"

The divine voice of Caspian, the Ocean Lord reverberates powerfully, "I really don't think that would be a good idea, Pandora."

A powerful male voice shouts, "GO caspian, it's your birthday, I love you caspian*snuggle*."

A giant rabbit flies from the direction of the Garden and lands on Jarik with a thud that is felt all the way across Sapience.

The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Just ignore the fool. He is being given exactly what he desires - attention."

A powerful male voice shouts, "Funny, who was the first to give it to him."

Slowly the snake unclamps his powerful jaws from Yig's trembling body, allowing him to slump to the ground in a heap.

The Naga are formed.
