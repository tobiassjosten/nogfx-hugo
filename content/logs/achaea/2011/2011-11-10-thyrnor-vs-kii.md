picking up both speed and power as it travels. The bed of the river is strewn

shrouds a waterfall of tremendous power and altitude. The river channel narrows 
to the south and the rocks become visibly sharper, rendering the channel 
impossible to navigate for even the wisest boatman or swimmer. A path leads to

Rapids along the Muurn.
The river begins its pell-mell descent down the face of the mountains here, 
picking up both speed and power as it travels. The bed of the river is strewn 
with boulders but the current pays them no heed as it rushes by. In fact, the 
area directly behind the boulders seems to be the only place the water is calm 
and smooth. A near-deafening roar rises from the north, where a cloud of mist 
shrouds a waterfall of tremendous power and altitude. The river channel narrows 
to the south and the rocks become visibly sharper, rendering the channel 
impossible to navigate for even the wisest boatman or swimmer. A path leads to 
the water's edge along the bank. A sign posted next to the trail reads "Rocks 
ahed...no swimin". A water weird is here, sleeping soundly.
