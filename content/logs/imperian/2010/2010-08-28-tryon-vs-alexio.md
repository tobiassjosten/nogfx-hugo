You have recovered balance.
Suddenly a nearby branch seizes you and flings you unceremoniously from the 
location.
An animal graveyard.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. You see exits leading 
southeast and northwest.

You pause a moment to observe the surrounding area.
To the SOUTHEAST you see:
Where animals go to die.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A fairly large pile of
golden sovereigns twinkles and gleams. A large beehive hangs down from the 
trees above. A nefarious albino jackal towers here, a sickly grin twisted upon 
her miasmic maw. What appears to be a mere shadow upon the ground is a dead 
demon. A demonic beast lies here, clearly dead. Blood mingles with the pus 
surrounding this dead demon. A fat demon lies here dead, the boils on his skin 
oozing out the last of their pus. A fat demon covered in boils stands here, 
lips twisted into a horrible grin. A deformed demon stands here covered in 
blood. There are 2 corpses of a mighty earth golem here. Dotting the ground 
around you with black and yellow, lay a massive number of dead bees. A sleek 
black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A massive groomed black 
stallion stands here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. A
mighty earth golem stands guard here. A swarm of bees hovers menacingly nearby.
Tryon Swiftpaw is here. He wields a sharpened quarterstaff in his hands.
You see exits leading east and northwest.

To the NORTHWEST you see:
Before a pile of bones.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A demonic beast snorts
and stamps his feet as he rages about the room. A diseased demon stands here in
a puddle of pus. A fat demon covered in boils stands here, lips twisted into a 
horrible grin.
You see exits leading southeast and northwest.

apart his innards, causing a maximum of horrifying pain, and, enjoying the 
spectacle of Tryon writhing and screaming in agony, you rip out his sternum and
drive it through his splayed body, pinning him to the ground to die.
You have slain Tryon.
