Imperial Parade nearing the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
A thunderstorm rages in the heavens, and rain blasts down all around you. A 
sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The 
mighty war gong of Stavenn looms here, hanging between two pillars of fused 
bone. The visage of a horrific demon carved in bloodstone rises up from a base 
of skulls and stone. A bubbling noise can be heard coming from the dark liquid 
of the fountain that has been placed here, as the occasional heart-shaped 
cherry bobs along the flowing fluid. A slow oozing of blood runs the length of 
this black cross. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air.
An elite Diavlous Knight is manning a cannon here. He has ninety-eight cannon 
balls. Carefully watching everything, a white snow tiger slowly paces the area.
A fierce sabretooth tiger prowls silently here. Smoky tendrils constantly 
twisting and weaving around a towering demon statue, a shadow servant is here. 
A kohdon scout stands here eyeing his surroundings with an impassionated stare.
Anointed with blood, a heinous demonic jackal crouches here baring gleaming 
teeth. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A 
fearless Shaahri stallion trots about. Barely able to stand on all fours, a 
drunken pitbull is here, reeking of booze. A fetid stench informs you that a 
colossal one-eyed hound is here. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this 
daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. A black ouroboros 
oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. The undead form 
of Erus Shukron, Ethereal Lich is here. He wields a lunar shield in his left 
hand and a scourgebone daegger in his right.
You see exits leading east, southeast, west, and northwest.

listlessly in the wind. An ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally 
decorated pedestal here. The dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed 
brutally to the point of a rigid, black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, 
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. A short, stone basin 
rests upon a pedestal here filled with blood. A captivating, wrought-iron 
display case sits here, decorated with an assortment of horseshoes, bone beads 
and feathers. A glass windchime has been hung here, the lily pads that hang 
from it constantly clanking together in a soothingly melodic manner. A 
magnificent flag, emblazoned with the crest of the Empire ripples regally from 
the columns of the gates. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. The
decapitated head of Rogan has been carelessly tossed aside. There are 9 
maidenhair leaves in 3 groups here. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram 
floats in mid-air. A shaggy grey mustang roams warily nearby. There are 15 
elite elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. An elite Diavlous Knight is manning a 
cannon here. He has 103 cannon balls. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the 
room. The undead remains of a pallid stallion is here. A sleek black hound 
stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A Kenuba hippopotamus stands here, 
massive jaws agape. Stamping his golden hooves and tossing his crimson mane, 
this blooded warhorse stands here bearing a regal strength. There are 26 elite 
Diavlous Knights here. Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the 
Modin Valley stands here impassively. Little more than a pile of mangled fur 
and bone, a mottled groundhog lies here dead. A Kenuba hippopotamus stands 
here, massive jaws agape.

Drawing on the power of undeath, you wreathe your hand in black, crackling 
energy. With a diabolical laugh, you stiffen your hand and slowly run it down 
Shukron's chest, splitting it open as you do so. With an expert touch, you rip 
apart his innards, causing a maximum of horrifying pain, and, enjoying the 
spectacle of Shukron writhing and screaming in agony, you rip out his sternum 
and drive it through his splayed body, pinning him to the ground to die.
You have slain Shukron.
