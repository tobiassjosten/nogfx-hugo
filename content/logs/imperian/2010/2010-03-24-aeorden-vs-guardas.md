A dimly lit waiting room. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A black wolf stalks silently here, 
sniffing the air for prey. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive 
woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Amber eyes flashing, 
a Seraphic guardian floats here on red and gold feathered wings. Its head 
proudly held high, a majestic stallion stands here, its veritum armour 
positively shining. A regal white falcon is here, keeping a vigilant watch. Sri
Guardas Bercalion, the Faythful Guardian is here. He wields a Mace of Vahin in 
his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Linelle Fordaetha is here, 
camouflaged. Mulazzim Laethus Vin'Zyan, Adherent of Charity is here. He wields 
a curved sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north and east.
