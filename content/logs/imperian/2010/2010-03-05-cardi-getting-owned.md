Northern edge of the Erorag common square. (Ogre Fort, Erorag.)
Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. A demon resembling 
the wizard Hycanthus idly paces here. A white furred hound with shining topaz 
eyes sits here in serene silence. The undead form of Sergeant Menoch Andarial is
here. He is rapidly swinging a sword above his head.
You see exits leading north, east, southeast, south, southwest, and west.

Sergeant Menoch Andarial says, "Sure."
<27/449h 368/480m> 

Your consciousness shifts, and you feel your body no more.

<36/449h 354/480m> 

You feel a moment of disorientation, followed by a sensation of floating upward 
as if you had no weight.

<45/449h 340/480m> 

Looking about yourself, you notice that you have in fact risen a few feet above 
the ground, and in a terrifying revelation you see your body lying twisted and 
broken before you.

<54/449h 318/480m> 

After gazing a moment in horror, you notice the color and vibrancy around you 
begins to fade. As the brightness of your surroundings melt into a dismal gray, 
you hear a faint and yet high-pitched droning sound.

<72/449h 281/480m> 
Midnight tolls and a new day comes to the land.
It is the 24th day of Letum, in the year 603 AD.
<72/449h 281/480m> 
(Market): Menoch says, "Seeking more attempts from Cardi to jump myself and a 
near novice!"
<81/449h 268/480m> 

The droning noise increases in intensity, and within seconds the sound becomes a
deafening cacophony resembling a thousand voices wailing in agony.

<90/449h 254/480m> 
You feel your density return to normal. (density)

<100/449h 231/480m> 
[Salve balance reset.]
<100/449h 231/480m> 

The shadows about you grow darker, and begin to coalesce into humanoid shapes. 
The shadow figures suck the darkness from the area, leaving a gray haze behind 
in its place.

[*Unable to handle salve balance.*]
<100/449h 231/480m> 
[Resetting defence 'density'.]
<100/449h 231/480m> 

The shadow figures begin to approach you menacingly. Suddenly they are upon you,
grabbing onto your form and dragging you back towards the ground.

<118/449h 195/480m> 

You are sucked below into the earth. You watch the soil fly past your eyes, and 
you can see nothing but rocks and earth and bones flashing by as you are pulled 
deeper and deeper into the depths.

<136/449h 168/480m> 

At last you break free from the earth, and you are suddenly falling from a 
vaporous sky.

<145/449h 145/480m> 

You plummet past thick cloud cover, and briefly see the black and wicked skyline
of a terrible city before you crash in its midst.

<163/449h 108/480m> 

You stand up, miraculously unharmed. You realize you suffered no bodily harm 
because you are without form, having entered the void of the dead.
