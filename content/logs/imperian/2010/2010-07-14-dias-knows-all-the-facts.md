I spoke with Zerin since in her final part of her letter she said she would be
more than willing to make ammends or speak with individuals. When I spoke to
her I was met with disrespect. She speaks as if she is still one of those from
Stavenn, and I do not see any activity of her husband to join Anti Magick, and
that is problamtic indeed.

She has raided this city many a time, her sentance should have been increased,
perhaps my fault with my lack of updating our enemy scrolls do to issues with
my soul. However, the point lies in her speech. She insulted me speaking of how
"She would gain entrance to this city because she has connections" and that she
would gain a majority vote because she had assured it. I do not like this talk
because it gardners that she is acting like a Stavennite still.

Too many times have we allowed some one who would "Be able to spill blood for
Antioch" into our city only to have them leave a year or two later and havoc us
with their raids once more. I refuse to see this again. I implore you all to
vote not to have her citizened once again. She was removed from Stavenn from
disrespect and that is directly what I was told by a citizen. She did not quit.
