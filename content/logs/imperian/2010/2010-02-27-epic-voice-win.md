You sing, "Nulous luos ka llan irayana rubait kiyan mellaon sianllan arinyu 
kawis nuarinyu gyin daemos iluma maimra chamine karinyu ravsafa myried shaite 
ramallan muamte yoth briah oyiem hukui!!"
The shadows creep into the room as you utter the word of darkness.
At your command, light floods your vision as the shadows are banished to hidden
recesses.
A shimmering image of Knight Commander Mael Vin'Zyan appears before you. He is 
at A steam filled cavern.
A healing sensation washes over your being.
This room is already recieving increased plant growth.
The sound of your voice rips into Kinuma's organs, causing her to double over 
in pain.
You command Kinuma to live a more peaceful life.
Kinuma's eyes close suddenly as she falls asleep.
Kinuma appears to be strengthened and refreshed.
You feel no effect from the healing powers of Arinyu.
A shimmering image of a short, sturdy log appears before you. It is shrouded in
darkness.
The sound of your voice rips into Kinuma's organs, causing her to double over 
in pain.
Kinuma wakes up with a gasp of pain.
The querying word of diagnosis reveals Kinuma's afflictions to you.
She is:
sprawled on the ground.
unnaturally stupid.
You begin listening closely in order to comprehend foreign tongues.
Pain flashes across Kinuma's eyes, as your words stun her.
Kinuma grasps her head, suffering intense pain from your words.
Kinuma appears to be strengthened and refreshed.
A healing sensation washes over your being.
Panicking, Kinuma clutches at her throat.
You do not have enough mana for that.
Alas, your mana reserves are too low for that.
