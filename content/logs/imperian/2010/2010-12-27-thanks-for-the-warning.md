--- Stand of Birch and Maple ------ 3:4:0 ---
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. A dense crown of small branches and twigs tops the thin trunk of a 
sweet-smelling crab apple tree. A sturdy log has been left here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, and southwest.

Aeorden and Drongon enter from the ether following Patek, riding a muscular 
vorep named Cleket.
They are followed by a massive tundra bear, a pale white tern, a sea lion, a 
small reef heron, a small white fox, and a snowy owl.

Aeorden moves in to engage you.

You turn to flee and Aeorden brings a venerated sabre of the Suns crashing down
onto your right leg, breaking it.

Aeorden takes a drink from a polished golden vial of the Suns.

(Kinsarmar): Jazzster says, "Stay away from the gank gang of Aeorden, Drongon, 
and Patek, heh."
