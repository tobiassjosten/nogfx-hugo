Lady Nael Covenia, Knight of the Diavlous says, "This is hard work, being so wicked."

You peer at Nael unscrupulously.

You grin mischievously at Nael.

Nael grins mischievously at you.

You say to Nael, "But it is so deliciously fun being bad, get to drive all the men mad as you butcher them apart."

Lady Nael Covenia, Knight of the Diavlous says, "Nael what wickedness shall we wreak upon the world this day?"

You say to Nael, "Make Dias cry when he wakes, make Kinsarmar tremble, but for now, get Jasmina an open monolith for her to control, you ready to be wicked."

Lady Nael Covenia, Knight of the Diavlous says, "I am always ready, is that no why you called me up?"

You have emoted: Nael glances over at her doppleganger, assesses it for a moment and then gives a wicked grin. "Yes you will do nicely."
