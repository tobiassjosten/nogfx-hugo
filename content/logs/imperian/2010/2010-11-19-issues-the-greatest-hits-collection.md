Issue #97188   Reported by: Runi    Re: Kayden
2010-11-09 00:13:45: 
I am really tired of the cyber-bullying that Kayden, Sadie, Tahmuras, Ahkan, and Cadeyrn are doing. They're grouping together to harass me in-game and make fun of me on the forums, and I don't want this to do keep happening. Cyber-harassment (saying or doing things on the Internet that harm, builly, or otherwise harass other people) is illegal. Ahkan is using the Imperian service to commit crimes for his own amusement.

[My favorite part is that she spammed this at 5 people and, at least in mine, couldn't be bothered to change "Ahkan" to "Kayden" at the end.]
