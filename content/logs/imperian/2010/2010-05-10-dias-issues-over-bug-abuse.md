Issue #96516 Reported by: Dias Re: Iluv 2010-05-10 20:12:17: 
It's been quite some time since I have issued some one, but the abuse that Iluv
has indulged in is quite horrid. Tumbling out of a room, Iluv is some how able 
to keep me impale to the ground although I am out of the room, have writhed 
free and everything. I'm not sure what bug this is an abuse of, but I know that
I have never encountered that by some one before.

replyissue 96516 There is no bug being abused. AB BRUTALITY JOUST
