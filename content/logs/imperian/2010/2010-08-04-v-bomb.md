The center of a sandstone obelisk.
Balanced easily on its oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with its huge, blue eyes. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A wide band of black encircling her neck, a large ginger-furred silril pads here. Pale eyes shining, a spotted lynx paces here restlessly. A skittish snowshoe hare scampers about underfoot. A dark crow perches nearby, glaring at your every move. Eyes alert and claws at the ready, a fierce wolverine stands his ground. Gazing serenely from its perch, a graceful gyrfalcon surveys the area. An elusive snow leopard prowls the area, eyes roving with a sullen glare. A watchful golden-brown falcon is perched here. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A statuesque Seraph with pristine white wings hovers above the ground here. A Seraphic guardian stands menacingly nearby, with flashing eyes and majestic flame-wreathed wings.

She wields a blood-stained javelin of bone in her left hand and a truesilver shield in her right. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Song, Aspect of Aryana. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Zerin, Aspect of Aryana. She wields a truesilver mace in her left hand and a tower shield in her right. Mr. Iluv Arkadis, the Man-Eater is here, hidden.
