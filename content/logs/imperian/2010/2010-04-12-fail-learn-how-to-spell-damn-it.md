A surge of elation rushes through you as you realize that Hiramius's fate is

You have slain Hiramius.
Hiramius leaves to the ether.

End of a small tunnel. (Southwestern Arena.)
Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. Hunched 
over himself a brooding vulture snaps at anything in reach. Wings outstretched 
to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Prowling about on
silent paws, a swift cheetah watches you closely. Fluttering about, a small 
sparrow twitters merrily. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks 
about. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Markie, Aspect of Aryana.
He wields a broadsword of Vahin in his left hand and a lunar shield in his 
right.
You see a single exit leading south.
