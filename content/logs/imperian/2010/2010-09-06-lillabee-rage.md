Dear Empire,
With People like Oburi in Stavenn who shoves his dick in plenty of little ladies, I shall take my 
leave from this place.  I urge you citizens, get rid of this transmitted disease while you can, for 
fear his plague will curse you all!  Also, fuck YOU you fat piece of shit.
 
Penned by my hand on the 8th of Bellum, in the year 617 AD.
