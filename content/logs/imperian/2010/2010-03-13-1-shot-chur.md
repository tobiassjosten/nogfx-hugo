You follow Mikihide to the east. (follow)
A wide landing. (OGRE Fort, Erorag.)
Stairs climb the eastern wall, spanning the floor in one corner to the ceiling 
in the other, leading down to the ground and up to the roof. Bows hang from 
racks on the walls, and small bins sit in various places, all holding arrows. 
Small arrow windows open out to the outside, slanted to allow archers to shoot 
out without providing targets to the ground. A door opens to the west leading 
into a small chamber, framed on both sides with racks of polearms for the 
guards. Standing with a fearsome presence, Chur, the OGRE Captain is here.
You see exits leading west, up, and down.
