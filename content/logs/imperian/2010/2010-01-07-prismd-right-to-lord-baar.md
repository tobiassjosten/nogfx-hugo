You touch the prism tattoo and suddenly a razor-thin beam of prismatic light 
shoots off into the distance.

An irresistible force pulls you along to the other end of the prismatic light. (prism)

A Treasure Trove of Gifts.
A comforting feeling of privacy pervades the area. A regal white frog sits 
here, his eyes surveying all he commands. An opaque throne with shining 
upholstery stands here, its seat molded from many hours of use by the God of 
Imagination. Covered with tiny black ants, the sugar cookie on the ground here 
looks rather unappealing. Vashir is here, wreathed in divine fire.
You see exits leading north, east, and in.

With a flourish of your arm, you bow deeply.

Baar appears out of thin air.

Baar takes Ki in His hand and directs a chartreuse ray towards Cardi.
A chartreuse sunray heats the air around you to an uncomfortable level. You 
understand that your behavior may not be quite endearing to the Lord of the 
Seven Suns.

You say, "Lord Baar."

With a flourish of your arm, you bow deeply.

Baar looks up into the air for divine inspiration.

Vashir says, "What do you want me to do with him, Lord?"

Vashir says, "I know an unescapable volcano I can drop him in."

You say, "Praise Lord Baar! Ki has returned!"

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "He will wish he was in a volcano, coming here
unannounced."

You fall to your knees and begin to worship Baar.

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns frowns and says to you, "Kneel, worm."

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns nods curtly.

You have emoted: Cardi averts his gaze downwards.

You have recovered balance.

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "Give me a single good reason why I should not
incinerate you where you writhe, Mortal."

You say, "I bring you offerings Lord Baar."

Vashir snickers softly to himself.

Vashir says, "What does a God want with your offerings, mortal."

Baar stares implacably at you.

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "Proceed..."

You say, "I come with news as well Lord, Glorious news!"

A dark shadow creeping across its face, the blood red moon of Terror forces the
stars around it to dull themselves.

Vashir says to Baar, "A mortal thinks he can tell You something You don't 
already know?"

You say, "My Fellow Citizens, believe they have saw Ki! Praise Lord Baar!"

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns sets His jaw firmly, dourly irritated. "Then speak,"
he rasps. "Perhaps I will let you live.".

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns frowns and says, "You mock me?"

Vashir says, "He does, Lord."

You say, "I doth not Lord!"

Vashir says, "May I have my fun with him now?"

You say, "I am your eternal servant, my life is nothing but a grain."

You say, "Of sand."

Baar, Lord of the Six Suns thins His lips grimly, vexed.

You say, "Should you allow me to live, I shall spread Your message more 
thoroughly Lord Baar."

You see Vashir shout, "Time for a little fun! Taking requests whether the 
upcoming gemhunt should be friendly or bloody, generous or selfish."


Baar, Lord of the Six Suns says, "Believe what you will. Spread what word you 
will. Be out of My sight and if you return, I will ensure you never come back 
from Dis."

You are transported by the will of the gods.

You say, "Yes my Lord!"

Palm Gate. (City of Antioch.)
A large piece of sandstone inscribed with the word 'WARNING!' juts upwards from
the surrounding desert. A large bolt thrower has been constructed here.
A set of ornately wrought, massive gates stand to the northeast (gate closed) 
and southwest (gate closed).
