Guardas, the last samurai since the fall of Tokugawa Katsuma, surveys the lands. He has been wandering for days, in search for those honourable enough to face him in one to one combat.

"These scum," Guardas remarks as he watches as the dishonourable around him fight in large numbers and interrupt duels. 

"They always fight off prime time hours," he whines as his eyes glaze back to a time before the lands have fallen into a pit of corruption and despair. "This would have never happened if the other councils and cities fixed their org," he says with a sigh.

Travelling along the path he comes across a foe that seemed to equal him in honour and virtue.

"A-ha!" Guardas exclaims! He draws his katana out from his sheath and levels it at the enemy. 

"Will you be the one to finally defeat me?" he asks the shadowy villain. The enemy laughs sadistically and summons demons from the ground to attack Guardas. With vicious accuracy and swiftness Guardas cuts through the demons with his katana, his fancy footwork making sure he is not to be found when the demons make their strikes.

Soon all the demons have been cut down and only the villain remains. Taking a closer look, Guardas recognizes the foe to be Kuroyami Ashel, the forum ninja.

"Guardas, what Trez said about you and off-hours rai..." Ashel was saying before he was abruptly interrupted by Guardas. "I will not hear it! Your troll-jutsu will not work on me you dishonourable coward!," Guardas exclaims as he pierces Ashel's dark heart with his blade.

"Learn to heal," Guardas says.

Ashel gives a few croaks before falling over into a pool of troll blood. Guardas wipes the blood of his katana while reciting the e-bushido code, "One must always censure classleads that seek to debuff us unless they give us a buff in return."

After sheathing his sword, Guardas continues wandering. He looks back at his fallen enemy and says, "We will meet again....

... on the forums."
