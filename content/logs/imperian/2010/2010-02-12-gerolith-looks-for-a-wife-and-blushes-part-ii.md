The Mounted Cephyreid. (Ithaquan Council.)
This has been marked as holy ground. Lined with spartan stools, a wide bar runs
the length of the rear wall. A weary old wolf lies in the corner upon a ratty 
rug, half-asleep. Sitting at the end of the bar is an impressive wolf's head 
which has been mounted on an ironwood base. Magaelan is here, holding aloft a 
rather large mug. A backless swivel stool sits here. The extraordinary wingspan
of an enormous black crow casts a grey shadow upon everything around it, 
rendering the surroundings in a foreboding black and white. A large, gold 
flecked hawk hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the 
light. A fur trimmed tapestry of hide, the Wendigo of Ithaqua depicted 
ominously in its center, hangs from the wall here. Balanced easily on its 
oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings with 
its huge, blue eyes. There are 3 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. A dead rat has 
been left here. There are 3 wooden mug of Warden's Milks here. You see a sign 
here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see a single exit leading out (open door).

Singing drunkenly to himself, Gerolith enters from the out.

<307/307h 370/370m 1402e 1658w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
A huge man, Gerolith, who refers to himself as "the God of Might", is a Norrjin
with heavily tanned skin. He is almost completely devoid of hair, save for a 
large handlebar mustache, and his bald head reflects gently back some of the 
light which strikes it. His chest is like that of an ale barrel and his limbs 
are wide with muscle to match, creating an image of strength. He smiles almost 
perpetually and his large brown eyes are warm and inviting, edged with the 
mirth that seems to be forever part of his mood. About his wide chest he wears 
a strong metal breastplate, though no other armor to match. Instead he wears a 
pair of heavy leggings and a pair of oversized boots stuffed with fur for 
warmth. Gerolith would be an imposing figure, if not for his obviously jovial 
appearance and the mug in his left hand, which seems somehow to always be full,
aiding in his perceived perpetual good mood.
Gerolith, God of Might appears to be extraordinarily strong.

Gerolith, God of Might says, "Ah, I hope I shall see her again! She was 
lovely... like a Goddess. Which is good, and befits one of My stature. I shall 
be needing a beautiful woman to brew My ale and warm My feet. I only hope she 
makes her food better than Magaelan."

Sommnus drains the last drops of a mixed cocktail from a wooden mug of Warden's

Sommnus chuckles long and heartily.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "Ah, but you all will recognize her when you 
see her, surely!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus smiles with a wink and says, "But there are plenty about that are

ale."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Gerolith did not blush! Blushing is for girls... 
and elves that titter and dance in tights. Gerolith was merely... distracted."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
"Mhmm," Surakai murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

Sommnus says, "If a gift you feel you must give, give something practical and 
worthy of a God of Might. A fine fur cloak of beasts felled by your own mighty 
hands. Not some weed plucked along the roadside."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "So. If Ithaqua sees a beautiful woman who 
looks like she needs to find a God in her life... Ithaqua knows what to do. And
Gerolith will keep looking and forget the silly bards and their advice!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>

Gerolith, God of Might says, "Also. Gerolith will punch in the teeth any he 
hears have been spreading savage rumors about women outsmarting him. And 
especially rumors about him blushing, which he did not do."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Surakai grins mischievously at Gerolith, God of Might.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>
You have emoted: Iolana considers just how attached to her teeth she really 
is...

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "And now, Gerolith, God of Might, will drink and 
allow the citizens of Ithaqua to entertain him with tales of bravery. Though 
they can never be as good as his own mighty deeds, it will amuse him to hear of
them nonetheless."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Surakai smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

gulp from it, managing to spill the majority.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Raini Sunjackal says, "Well.."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You give a mischievous grin.

I was beset upon by mountain trolls near the snowfields recently. I had 
dispatched a few troublesome monitors when the devious beasts snuck up from 
behind."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>

You tilt your head and listen intently.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus says, "I managed to slip their grasp but left an exaggerated trail back
into the Pines. I hid in the branches and lay wait for the monsters."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus says, "It wasn't long before they came right into my trap and they were
quickly disposed of as well."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus smiles and says, "The Pines are my shadows...and no place for mountain

Gerolith, God of Might says, "Oho! This is a good tale, Gerolith, God of Might 
approves!  Of course, the trolls would have been like mere insects to him, but 
it is not half bad for one like yourself."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>>

Gerolith, God of Might says, "Gerolith was not paying attention, and did not 
catch you in time. A God should not apologize to a mortal, but I will say I was

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "She is beautiful, more than any other I have 
seen. And mysterious, for she would not speak with me. Much less sit upon my

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus smiles and says, "Never eam babies, not enough meat on them."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Perhaps she eats babies. I do not accept such 
gifts."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Sommnus chuckles long and heartily.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Surakai smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You mutter, "Men..."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Juanope Sunjackal says to Sommnus, "But they are a little fattier for their 
size than most things."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You mutter, "An.. .ppare *hic* ...., Gods..."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Surakai Lothain says to you, "Excuse me?!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You blink.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You say to Surakai, "Why? What did you do?"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You tilt your head curiously.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Surakai narrows his eyes at you in an unnerving manner.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You hum innocently to yourself.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "But alas, Gerolith must be searching for his 
Beauty now."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <pbd>> 
You stand up.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You say, "I suppose *hic*  we can let you go, since it is such a noble search 
annd all."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Surakai Lothain says to Gerolith, God of Might, "I wish you the best of luck."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
 Sommnus stands up from the worn ironwood bar.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus stretches languidly.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope Sunjackal half-jumps, half-slides off, Gerolith's knee being too high.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Unless the women would like to throw me some sort
of celebration because I shall find my love and be married soon, and shall have
no eyes for any woman except for her, the most beautiful of all. In which case 
I shall be glad to stay a little longer and see what they might devise. I had 
thought some sort of dancing, perhaps?"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might looks hopeful.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>
You brandish a sleek javelin menacingly.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You give a mischievous grin.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus says, "Well, I wish you luck in your search and I'll keep my eyes open.
Should she somehow wind up in my Pines, I'll see that no wolves come sniffing 
after a beautiful meal."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus inclines his head toward Gerolith, God of Might respectfully.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "And for that you have the gratitude of a God. 
Which goes a very long way, I might add."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might stands to his feet, raising a fist high into the air.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You ponder the situation.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might exclaims, "On to the search!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You say to Gerolith, God of Might, "Good lucK!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus smiles and says, "T'was a pleasurable meat and drink, sir. And words 
exchanged with relish."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>
You kiss Gerolith, God of Might gently on the lips.

 <307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You wink.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You tell Juanope Sunjackal, "And there is my bold story for this month."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope gives you a shifty little smile.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>>
You gulp down a mixed cocktail, wetting your palate.
With a great amount of effort, you manage to drink some of the thick liquid, 
coughing as the drink slowly makes its way down, the wood chips and leaves 
within it rough against your throat.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope tells you, "Indeed."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Your eyes sparkle with amusement at Juanope.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope tells you, "I'm going to keep that one."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope nods sagely at you.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might says, "Fare thee well, Ithaquans! And if I should find 
her a dream and nothing more, perhaps I shall return here for a wife."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might waggles his eyebrows comically.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You give a trillingly melodic laugh.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might winks at you.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope Sunjackal says to Gerolith, God of Might, "Good luck!"

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Sommnus grins mischievously at Gerolith, God of Might.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Gerolith, God of Might waves goodbye.

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Juanope Sunjackal smiles impishly and says, "Or not."

<307/307h 370/370m 1436e 1751w 34x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Stumbling slightly, Gerolith leaves to the out.
