Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin 
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of 
utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in 
ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man 
with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue 
of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the 
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.
A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A 
small sign points into a market stall. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze 
cast over the Springs. A pallid stallion stands here idly. A demon resembling 
Hysaara, a shaman's apprentice idly paces here. A squat russet hound paces 
around, slobber dripping from his powerful jaws.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
