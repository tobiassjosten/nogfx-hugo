A narrow hallway. (Gongen Stronghold.)
The decaying remains of Ivellios lie here. A lovage leaf has been dropped here.
With a wild look in his eye, a feral paint stallion stands heatedly here as he 
stomps and paces recklessly. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes 
gazing upon you. There are 4 corpses of an orc scout here. There are 19 corpses
of an orc assassin here. There are 2 corpses of a rabid Lycaean slave here. The
body of an orc archer lies in a pool of blood here. There are 6 corpses of an 
ominous orc warrior here. There are 3 corpses of a robust orc female here. 
There are 3 corpses of a mutated orc here. There are 3 corpses of a massive orc
soldier here.
You see exits leading east, south, and west.

Aryana's Spring. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin 
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of 
utter cowardice. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat 
looms over the surrounding area. A small sign points into a market stall. A 
shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A 
detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic 
features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering
puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at
the base filled with offerings. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful 
shells moving in the wind. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in
the center of the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an 
impressive and striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning 
statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric
stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. Heated breath flaring his 
nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A red and black striped 
centipede scurries along the ground.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
