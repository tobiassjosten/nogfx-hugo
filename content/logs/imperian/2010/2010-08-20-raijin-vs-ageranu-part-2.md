You have recovered balance.
Drawing on the power of undeath, you wreathe your hand in black, crackling 
energy. With a diabolical laugh, you stiffen your hand and slowly run it down 
Ageranu's chest, splitting it open as you do so. With an expert touch, you rip 
apart his innards, causing a maximum of horrifying pain, and, enjoying the 
spectacle of Ageranu writhing and screaming in agony, you rip out his sternum 
and drive it through his splayed body, pinning him to the ground to die.
You have slain Ageranu.
