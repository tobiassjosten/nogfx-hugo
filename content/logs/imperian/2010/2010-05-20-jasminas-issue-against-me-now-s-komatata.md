Issue #96545   Reported by: Jasmina    Re: Komatata
2010-05-20 08:00:31: 
Snubbing me, unsnubbing me, then snubbing me again. I'd like him to be punished
for abusing this ability that was given to us by the Administration. Since what
he is doing is not its intended use

If this actually uphold's I will quit Imperian. I unsnubbed her to tell her to 
leave me alone and she starts complaining so I snubbed her again. If anything 
she should be punished for not knowing when to stay quiet and things wouldst 
lead to something as useless as this. Jasmina they have better thing's to do 
than to hear you complain about someone snubbing you

What the hell is this game coming to??
