The empty eastern square. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. 
Inviting a gaze, a large, upright mirror stands here. A small sign points into 
a market stall. There are 5 small darts here. Quite difficult to make out, a 
ghost floats above the ground here, moaning to itself. Knight Commander Mael 
Vin'Zyan is riding on an ebon shire stallion. He wields a tower shield in his 
left hand and a dwarven battleaxe in his right. The undead form of Haruspex 
Enteri Andarial is here.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin 
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of 
utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in 
ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man 
with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue 
of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the 
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.
A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A 
painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the 
surrounding area. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in 
the wind. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of 
the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and 
striking monument. A small sign points into a market stall. A hollowed humanoid
skull rests here, filled with a potent-smelling liquor. A flame-charred chariot
pulled by demonic goats stands here. Incredibly large, a colossal brown mammoth
stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares
attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. From its perch,
a night black hawk watches you intently with steady golden eyes. A stray cat 
wanders around here, searching the ground for food. The towering presence of 
Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate the room here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

The empty western square. (ruins of Caanae.)
