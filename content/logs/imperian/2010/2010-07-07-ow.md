Manoa West. (City of Antioch.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. This 
has been marked as holy ground. An elite Antioch cleric is manning a cannon 
here. She has seventy-six cannon balls. A black wolf stalks silently here, 
sniffing the air for prey.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, south, southwest (open door), and 
west.

The Drunken Ibex Tavern. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A large barrel of beer stands here. A 
whimsical hammock of midnight blue with dangling moon and star beads rests 
here, swaying gently. A simple chessboard made of wood rests here on a small 
table. Pelt stretched out and mouth agape, a black bear rug has been thrown 
here. Strangely slender, a chair resides near to the wall, crafted of pale wood
and overstuffed padding. Firmly, a carved ironwood chair rests here, bearing 
the form of a lion. A smoky glass phial has been left here. Several green 
leaves still clinging to its stubby stem, a small green apple rests on the 
ground here. Wrapped in a tight bundle, a sheaf of grain lies here. A narrow 
orange capped mushroom has been left here. Marnor the barkeep stands behind the
bar, polishing a mug. His curved horns displayed proudly, this tame ibex 
nibbles at a weed growing nearby. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a 
massive shire stands here poised and alert. A mighty redwood eagle soars 
through the air here, silent as a whisper as its eyes focus upon the ground. A 
white wolf stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey. Ike is sitting on a
black bear rug. Tari and Nagakura are sitting on the ground. Sister Deanara 
Tyrurdrenn is here, a blank look in her eyes. Brother Aaslef is here. Childe of
the Sands, Soraya Covante is here, hidden. She wields a lunar shield in her 
left hand and an Axe of Asakan Fury in her right. Brother Altec Xathclyde is 
here. Sister Enyalida is here, pondering. You see a sign here instructing you 
that WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading northeast (open door), east (closed door), south (open 
door), and in.
A murmur rises from those gathered in the tavern, as suspicious and angry 
glances are shot your way.

A gambling parlour. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. An attractive blackjack table is stationed

taste for risk. A butterfly and sunflower hammock sits here, swaying lightly. A
beady-eyed man with a green visor stands here, his eyes rapidly shifting back 
and forth.
You see a single exit leading north (open door).
