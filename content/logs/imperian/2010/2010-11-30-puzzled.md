Somehow Sadie flips away to the north.
She is followed by an enormous, white woolly mammoth named Kibou.
[Sadie - north]
Sadie has left 'Snow-covered mountain foot'.

Snow-covered mountain foot. (Bardosi Plains.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. The bright sun shines down, 
blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Your trail turning into a winding 
pathway through a medium slope of rocky debris and thick leafed shrubs, 
meanders its way until it meets a flat expanse before the forest. Looking back 
and up you can fully take in the venture you have just undergone. The mountain 
looms over you, giving you a dizzy sensation making you break your gaze and 
return to reality.
