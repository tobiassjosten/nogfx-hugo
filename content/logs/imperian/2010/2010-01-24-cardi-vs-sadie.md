We had a few of these 
With a quick prayer, Sadie expertly fashions some rope and cloth into the rough
semblance of a humanoid.

And a few of these
Your face contorted in a twisted grimace, you clench your fists to crush the 
life out of Sadie.
Sadie gasps and stumbles as an unseen force crushes the life breath out of her.
Equilibrium Taken: 3.75s

Quite a few of these
You feel sickened and weak by the aura of death emanating from Sadie. (something) (something) (focus)

You begin to choke as the maggots swell up in your throat, and the last thing 
you feel is the pain of being consumed alive.
You have been slain by Sadie. (all)
You are OUT of the Team Free-For-All!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
There are 4 beehives here. There are 2 flame-shaped sigils here. A pike with 
the decapitated head of Mathiaus has been erected. A shaggy grey mustang roams 
warily nearby. A massive, obsidian hued hound stands here snarling viciously.
You see a single exit leading down.
You ease yourself out of the Dragon stance.
Sadie stands triumphant, the winner of the Team Free-For-All in the Coliseum.
Sadie arrives from the ether.
Sadie has entered the area.
[No more known afflictions on you.]
