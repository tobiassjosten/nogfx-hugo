Abrupt end at a chasm. (road). (Northwest Arena.)
A gaping hole is all that is left of the path, which seems to have suddenly 
collapsed here. It's quite clear that some sort of major natural event caused 
the collapse of an entire section of the arena. A faint path can be picked out 
amongst the rubble leading under the ground. Little plant life grows here; the 
rock and gravel prevents much from taking root. A rune circle has been sketched
into the ground here. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon 
you. Sir Zexo Bercalion, Knight Captain is riding on an armoured battle 
stallion. He wields a Souledge Sabre in his left hand and a tower shield in his
right.
You see exits leading north and down.

You move in towards Zexo for the backbreaker.
You lift Zexo triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised 
knee with back breaking force.
With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, Zexo's head lolls aimlessly far 
too far to one side. Zexo collapses into such an undignified sprawl that you 
realise that the throw did indeed snap the spine like a dry twig.
You have slain Zexo.
