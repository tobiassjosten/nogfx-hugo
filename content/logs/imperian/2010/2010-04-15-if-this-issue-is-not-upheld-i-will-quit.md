Issue #96449   Reported by: Jasmina    Re: Iluv
2010-04-14 21:16:36: 
Killed me because he believes that he can obtain PK rights on me because I used
MIND SENSE to seek out his location. I said this to him in a tell "If you 
believe you can kill me because I simply sought out your location, then you are
a fool." He claimed I called him a fool, but he also admitted to claiming pk 
rights over something so trivial and stupid. Do you ever wonder why your 
playerbase is so low? It's because you have very vague pk rules. You allow 
people to claim pk over such little things? If this issue isn't upheld I will 
quit, and I will make sure a few others do as well, because they will see this 
and be severely disappointed in you if it isn't upheld.

replyissue 96449 She sensed me and I asked her why she was doing it. She told me it was at a request of another. Now my character can assume that that other person had ill-intent and that is the reason he/she asked Jasmina to sense me. That makes it so Jasmina is risking her life to scout information for this anonymous person. Also during our conversation she called Iluv pathetic and a fool and said that she would kill me two times. I have several In-Game reasons to kill Jasmina. The playerbase is low not because of vague PK rules but because of people like Jasmina who do not try to resolve conflicts in-game but resort to using issues. Issues should be a last attempt to stop constant harrassment, bannable offenses, and abuse of bugs that otherwise could not be handled ICly. This is one death she suffered for insulting me.
You post your response to issue #96449. Thank you.
