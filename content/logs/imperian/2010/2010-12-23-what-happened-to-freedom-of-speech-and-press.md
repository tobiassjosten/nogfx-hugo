Well, obviously we have a rapist in Kinsarmar. 

He's climbing in your battlements, snatching your guards up, trying to rape them. So you all need to hide your guards, hide your siege, hide your guards, hide your siege, hide your guards, hide your siege, and hide your cannons, cause they're raping everyone out there. 

You don't have to come and confess, we're scanning for you, we're gonna seek you, we gonna seek you. So you can path find and tell that, path find and tell that, path find and tell that, Stavyy boy, Stavv-ev-ev-y boy. 

We got your armour and you left your mark, and all, you are so dumb, you are really dumb, for real. 

"Eldreth got away, leaving behind evidence." 

"I was attacked by Eldreth in the apartments." 

So dumb, so dumb, so dumb, so!!!
