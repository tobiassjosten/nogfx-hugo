Overlooking the valleys of Northreach. (Demon's Pass.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
view here is spectacular, though the ground is precarious. The rocks are prone 
to violent slides where exposed and slippery where lichen covers them. Even 
where there is no lichen, moisture from low-lying clouds and morning dew coats 
the rocks, making them unreliable platforms. Light tends to reflect off of the 
clouds in spectacular fashions, however, creating rainbows of light and making 
it seem as though gems of unreal colors are floating in the air. The valleys in 
the distance are picturesque and fantastical, distant enough to seem 
uncluttered, unpolluted, and indistinct. You see exits leading southeast and 
west.
