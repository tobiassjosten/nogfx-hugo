Damnation. (Unknown)
A dormant shrine of Zanik stands here. A peaceful aura fills the area, 
emanating from Juran, Aspect of Aryana. Verick, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, 
filling the surroundings with a miasma of fear. He wields an elemental staff in
his left hand and a curved sabre in his right.
There are no obvious exits.
