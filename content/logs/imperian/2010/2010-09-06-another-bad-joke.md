(Market): Lyla says, "Trading one Token of the creator to get Jarrhn a set of balls."

((me traveling to celidon here))


The Celidon Threshold.
Lined with silken fabric of a silvery-blue hue, a simple basket sits in the 
corner. There are 2 monolith sigils here. Caelas Willowbrook stands here alert,scanning the area for signs of trouble. There are 2 fruit bats here. A sly red fox is sneaking about here. A fierce sabretooth tiger prowls silently here. Jarrhn Tellaris, Child of Water is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading north, up, and a massive granite boulder stands vigilant to the out (gate open).Caelas Willowbrook says, "Welcome to the Council of Celidon! Remember to be on your best behavior, and don't kill our fruit bats."You have reached your destination.

You give a cannon ball to Jarrhn Tellaris, Child of Water.

You take a drink of an elixir of mana from a tarnished silver vial.
Your mind feels rejuvenated.

You give a cannon ball to Jarrhn Tellaris, Child of Water.

You nod sagely.

Jarrhn Tellaris, Child of Water says, "Go fuck yourself."

You may drink another healing elixir.

Jarrhn leaves to the up.
[Jarrhn - Ascending the Threshold.]

You tell Lyla Lokrien, White Rose Wolf, "You owe me a token."
