Skillset    : Chivalry       Skillname   : New
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently Diavlous hounds are superior to Falcons or Kestrels in that they can 
detect anyone entering the area with bloodscent while the closest thing in 
Chivalry is OBSERVE, which is vastly inferior and prone to missing hidden and/or
camouflaged individuals.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
A new skill called VIGIL in chivalry that would rank the same as Bloodscent in 
Brutality. The requirements for this skill to work would entail that your 
falcon/kestrel are circling above the area.

Skillset    : Taekate        Skillname   : Jumpkick
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Excessive use of Jumpkick repeatedly helps to ensure a perfect double-break at 
all times, and gives an opponent little to no means of avoiding or fighting 
back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a cool-down timer to Jumpkick to prevent its use on a constant basis. This 
would force a monk into using the skill at more selective opportunities, and 
allow the opponent a chance to fight back effectively. A cool off time of 15-20 
seconds would be adequate, with any attempted use before then resulting in a 
message similar to "Your legs are too exhausted to perform such a complex move."

Skillset    : Kaido          Skillname   : All kai skills
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Kai is an intergral part of monk combat, both for defensive and offensive 
situations, however the use of a third "pool" in kai means these uses come 
without any real cost to the monk, and give little opportunity for the opponent 
to exploit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give all kai skills a relevant Mana drain (as monks rely heavily on mana for 
attacking and defending, this will help limit kai skill use, making it more 
selective). A drain of 50% compared to the kai cost (choke would cost 5 mana, 
strike would cost 8 etc) would be fine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Kai cripple is used almost exclusively as a stalling tactic to prevent the monk 
from dying when in unfavourable situations. This makes it increasingly difficult
for an opponent to kill them after they have managed to get the monk into a 
vunerable situation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add-in restrictions of a similar nature to other kai skills to prevent the use 
of kai cripple. Paralysis, both arms paralysed, both arms broken.
Solution #2:
To prevent consequtive uses, increase the cost of cripple to 70%, this will 
ensure even with a maximum mana pool it can only be used once, leaving the monk 
vunerable to attacks at a much earlier opportunity than before.

Problem:
Link currenly is only used for travel and wrench, both of which are skills that 
-might- see a single use every few weeks. Its practically a dead skill thanks to
the restrictions on travel and wrench.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Alter link as follow. Two monks in the same room perform a link with each other,
this would take a considerable balance (and a bit of roleplay flavour). From the
point of completion the monks minds are considered joined together. As a result,
all willpower drain is shared equally between the two monks effectively halving 
costs. For the purposes of mind locks, their mana level is considered 75% of 
their combined mana which will allow for slightly faster and more stable locks. 
The link will be considered a defense, so can be stripped to negate its effects,
and will still be removed when using travel, wrench, or when mana reaches 0.

Skillset    : Enslavery      Skillname   : Summoning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently, using enslavery requires that a player find 3 other Summoners to help
him form pacts. While pacting, the summoners can do absolutely nothing outside 
of the ritual without instantly killing everybody. The end result of this is 
that a full third of a Summoner's available skills are locked away unless they 
can get three other people using the summoner class to agree to participate in a
ritual that could easily kill them. If they can't find anybody willing, they 
never get to use Enslavery. Many summoners wait for days to find other people 
willing to risk summoning with them. There's even very little interaction or RP 
during the rituals, as the summoning restricts your character to only the 
commands used for the summoning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Change the summoning ritual for everything but Golgotha so that it can be done 
alone. The Noctu would scrawl his circle, chant, slit, and chant again. This 
would allow new summoners access to their skillset on their own time, without 
removing the RP of the ritual.
Solution #2:
Change the consquences of a failed summoning to something less than instant 
death. Perhaps a holocause bomb level explosion and the release of a demon to 
fight/kill? This would make it much more likely that older players would be 
willing to help newer ones. Combined with the first solution, this could help 
encourage people to get help summoning, so that they'll be able to survive the 
demon.

Skillset    : Groves         Skillname   : Lightning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
A major problem with Druid balance has always been the fact that upgrades to the
offensive power of the grove have to be balanced around Incinerate in Bonding. 
Recent changes making Maelstrom more usable have made this issue quite visible 
of late, with caster druids being able to put out an incredible amount of 
pressure for an easy incinerate. Another major problem with Druids is that their
offense is rather lackluster outside of the grove, with "caster style" druids 
being absolutely useless outside of the grove. This change is designed to help 
alleviate both problems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Change Lightning so that it's an ability of the Dryad bond and not a skill in 
groves. The Dryad Lightning would be functionally identical to grove lightning 
as it is now, but it would be able to be used outside of the grove, though only 
in the same room as the druid. The skill in Groves would be replaced with a 
skill that allowed a Dryad-form druid to use lightning on anybody in the area, 
just as it can be used now. The effect of this change is to make it impossible 
to combine Incinerate with Lightning, and to slightly increase a druid's 
offensive potential outside of the grove.

Skillset    : Crystalism     Skillname   : Cataclysm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently, Cataclysm has a limitation that uses of Erode through the same vibe 
have an internal cooldown - short enough for a single mage to chain erode, but 
long enough to prevent multiple mages from eroding through a single vibe. 
Unfortunately, this limitation is easily bypassed by giving each mage his or her
own room with a Cataclysm vibe, allowing for the same unparalleled stripping 
capability, limited only by however many mages one brings. The fact that the 
mages are split up becomes nearly irrelevant when the entire area is forcibly 
locked down by a combination of erode and other magick-circle skills. Adjusting 
the internal cooldown for balance is impossible as they can always create more 
Cataclysm vibes, and rendering it to only allowing a single vibe per area is an 
unnecessary limitation on skill usage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove the extant internal vibe cooldown, and add a target-based cooldown. This 
removes the need for multiple cataclysm vibes in multiple rooms, while 
simultaneously removing the capability for multiple mages to strip a target down
to nothing at the same time. While efforts may be spread to multiple targets, 
the odds of striking each one's cloak is considerably lower, allowing time to 
escape/counteract.

Skillset    : Necromancy     Skillname   : New
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
As it stands right now, those with the Deathknight profession are often left 
playing a guessing game when creating a "possessed" demon as per AB Necromancy 
Possess. This can be a major problem because possess will  rapidly drain 
essence, over the course of multiple demons, until you find the minimum number 
to use.  It would simplify and streamline that process as well as giving a 
Necromancer some flexibility in knowing how much essence he/she can use and 
still be able to summon a demon, vivisect, keep powering deathaura, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
To fix this problem I propose that the Necromancy skillset receive a new skill 
called "Dissect". This skill would cost a small amount of essence, anywhere from
1-5% based on the size of the creature, and would allow the Necromancer who used
the skillset to know the exact, minimum amount of essence require to animate the
creature in question.
Solution #2:
As an alternative to solution 1, I propose that Necromancers gain a passive 
ability within Necromancy called DEMON SIGHT. This ability would allow them to 
PROBE <corpse> and then figure out the exact, minimum amount of essence required
possess the corpse in question.

Most people agree that the hounds of the Deathknights are superior to the 
kestrel or the falcon. This is simply another option to address that issue while
giving players a few more options.

Solution #1:
Each side would be given two options, either an aerial pet which would act like 
a falcon/kestrel (Hawks for the Diavlous, logically), or a land pet like the 
hound (Mastiffs for Runeguards and Alaunt for Templar). The birds would provide 
passive razing on a random tick once they became "warhawks" and the canids would
have access to Bloodscent but no razing. They would each have a visual 
difference "hound", "mastiff" and "alaunt" being their "item type" when 
submitting customization, so that they couldn't be mistaken by opposing sides 
and you would be able to choose which type of ent you had upon requesting it in 
the hatchery (this may require a revamp of some room descs, but ideally you'd 
still only need the one room).

Problem:
Antimagick lacks a defensive option that both Demonic and Magick have easy 
access to. Totems allow for great raid defense in Townes, and in Cities. They 
assist in slowing down or stopping a force from moving through  and simply just 
taking over the area unless they happen to bring a cannon.

Solution #1:
give Devotion users the ability to make holy symbols, that would be embued with 
rites the rites acting at a smaller capacity then their room affected ones, each
rite that can be embued would act more like a rune counter part when embued into
a holy symbol. The holy symbol would then be bound to a room and tuned like a 
totem. This would be the only way to use them.
Solution #2:
The rites that would be applied are Piety = Paralyse, Warding = Fear, 
Condemnation = Damage, Cleasing = would strip deafness or blindness/ or one

Skillset    : Runelore       Skillname   : Totem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently, totems are able to be implanted everywhere in the world, though this 
implanting is generally designed for the purpose of organization defense. While 
this is generally not a problem, a Druid having access to an implanted totem in 
his grove, laden heavily with sowolu runes, creates such a heavy amount of 
damage that the Druid is able to launch an incinerate the moment his target hits
the totem. This is a serious problem as a Druid, with access to a number of 
abilities in Groves (Hinder, Naturebind, Cage) that enable a very high chance 
for Grove Summon to be successful. This issue is augmented by the fact that, in 
order to avoid a Grove Summon, most people have to Survival Crash through 
multiple rooms of the Druid's terrain (assuming they even have that skill). RNG 
alone dictates that, eventually, you're just going to be unlucky with Hinder, 
and the Summon will be successful. Considering that summoning a Druid out of his
grove is near impossible (Grove Roots), yanking him -is- impossible (Grove 
Cage), many are forced to face the Druid in his grove, and the totem sets up the
kill from the start. Grove Eject and Grove Displace are equally problematic, as 
they allow a Druid to bounce targets against the totem in question.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Prevent a totem from being implanted in a grove, and prevent a grove being 
ported to/imprinted on an implanted totem. This would still allow RGs in a group
combat situation still prop totem.
Solution #2:
Rather than be unable to to co-exist with a totem, cause implanted totems in the
presence of a grove (ported or imprinted) to be "grown over" rendering runes 
unable to be viewed. In the case of propped totems, reduce the effectiveness of 
sowolu, in line with the reduction of enfeeble's ability to weaken the tactic of
enfeeble/absolve at the opening of group combat. While this can still do a hefty
amount of damage, and can still be coupled with other sources of damage to open 
the Incinerate window, it will require a bit more time, and the possibility of 
bad timing will allow for the unlucky victim to potentially survive with some 
quick healing/reserves.

Limit the amount of sowolu's that could be placed on a totem (2 for standard

Skillset    : Kaido          Skillname   : Enfeeble
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently, Kai Enfeeble reduces a target to 51% of their current health/mana and
stuns for 1 second. When combined with Absolve/Catharsis or Incinerate, Enfeeble
can be used to kill someone with a simple trigger, unstoppably, unless they're 
at or above maximum health and mana.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Cause Enfeeble to give a 2 second affliction, 1 second longer than the stun, 
that prevents the target from being absolved/catharsis'd or incinerated. If 
either are attempted, it will take balance or equilibrium but do nothing to the 
target. Attempted incinerates won't cause them to lose flame, and attempted 
absolves won't cost seraph health.
Solution #2:
Solution 1, but make it impossible to attack the target with any skill for the 2
seconds that the "affliction" exists.
Solution #3:
Solution 1 or 2, but with this message given when an enfeeble/absolve is 
attempted: "You have too much remorse to do such a thing."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Using HOUND SEEK <person> is slower than using HOUND DELIVER <something> 
<person> (by 2 seconds as a Fast statpack). It's faster to deliver 1 gold to 
your target than it is to seek them, and this makes it even more obvious that 
the hound/falcon/kestrel has entered.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Reverse the speeds. Seek should be faster than Deliver, logically speaking, 
since the hound/falcon/kestrel is carrying something with Deliver, it should get
there slower.
Solution #2:
Equalize the speed in some way. Either speed up Seek or slow down Deliver, or 
take the average and give it to both.

Skillset    : Smithing       Skillname   : Soulquench
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
With the recent release of statpacks we see much more diverse selection of races
in the game world. As a consequence however, soulquench, an ability that depends
entirely on the race of your target, has been greatly weakened. While in the 
past it was only absolutely necessary to have one or two axes to to cover almost
every combat scenario, it is now required for a Diavlous who wishes to go the 
damage route to carry at least 4 soulquenched, high damage weapons in order to 
cover every race in the game, thus making DK require more well smithed weapons 
than any other class in the game in order to maximize their offense.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove the racial restriction of soulquench entirely and simply have a 
soulquenched weapon periodically deal extra damage in the same way it does now 
without the racial checks. This would require only one decent weapon in order to
take full advantage of soulquench.

removed

Skillset    : Sabotage       Skillname   : Scourge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The addition of Scourge has been a positive change to Saboteur combat, 
increasing the viability of puncture over dstab in some situations. However, the
secondary effect of Scourge has proven lacking in helping address the 
limitations of forcing Saboteurs to switch between focusing entirely on 
afflictions and focusing entirely on damage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
For the duration of the Scourge effect, add Trioxin to affliction punctures 
instead of Formaldehyde to Trioxin punctures. This would be far more effective 
for adding pressure, given the limited use of Formaldehyde and the short 
duration of the window.
Solution #2:
Extend the secondary 'poisoned' effect of Scourge to last until either fenugreek
is applied successfully or the target dies, letting someone work toward 'locking
out' salves to take full advantage of the opportunities granted by Scourge.

Problem:
Currently, mages are forced to move off profession, and into branches of skills 
that really have no direct correlation with their skillset, such as weaponry.  
Yes, some of the skills in there can be usefull, but in order to deliver a toxin
reliably, we are forced to abandon magick, which our profession is supposed to 
use as its main attack, and instead go ahead with poking and prodding people 
with sharp things..doesnt seem very magelike.  If a person has the credits to 
invest into weaponry and the like, hey, they probably wont mind slapping on 
weaponry, and stabbing that zealot with a sharp...sabre?

Skillset    : Runelore       Skillname   : Vortex
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
In group or team combat, the vortex rune circle makes it impossible to 
coordinate the group properly without having ready access to walls to prevent 
the vortex from splitting everyone up. This makes mounting any retaliation to a 
raid group using vortex much harder than it should be. Getting hit by vortex 
prevents following a leader and using shields to defend against ranged skills. 
The only choice is to retreat out of range or suicide rush a well prepared 
group.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove the 'teleportation' aspect of vortex when it moves you from room to room.
Have each vortex tick attempt to drag the targets from room to room similar to 
seraph beckon, or other yanking skills. This would mean that block, stand firm, 
rubble, as well as wall would be effective defenses against the vortex. To have 
the vortex be fully effective, the vortexing group would have to attack and 
remove the blocking defenders or obstructions to get the full effect.

Skillset    : Hypnosis       Skillname   : Deadening
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Lifevision is a formidable and effective counter to the effectiveness of 
illusions in combat. Yet no matter how long a fight drags on, there exists 
nothing in the Assassin's toolbox to negate it. Given how relatively common 
Lifevision is as a defense, this presents a balancing problem. A well played 
Assassin should have something at their disposal to counter this innate 
advantage, even if that tool is situational and difficult to use.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give Deadening a chance when afflicted, and periodically after, to strip the 
target from a small list of specific mental defenses, among them Lifevision, 
Selfishness, Insomnia, Metawake, and Quince. Anyone in a condition to do so 
could simply re-raise the lost defense and cure the affliction, but it presents 
an opportunity to press an offense sufficient to prevent that.
Solution #2:
Negate all illusion detection abilities while the subject is afflicted by 
Deadening, without any defense stripping.

Problem:
Right now, Convergence is impossible to pull off for a mage. It is perhaps the

Skillset    : Naturalism     Skillname   : New
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently, maintaining a network of naturalism trees requires a large amount of 
effort, but provides virtually no benefits to the druids who invest their time 
in raising and protecting the saplings. Because they are usable only in a single
forest room which then cannot be used as a grove, trees find almost no use in 
actual combat, for in gaining a single weak effect druids are forced to give up 
all the advantages of the entire skill of Groves.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Rather than rousing the tree for an instant effect, allow druids to harvest 
seeds from the great trees which could then be stored in the druid's inventory. 
These seeds could be tossed on the ground in any non-grove room at a later time,
to provide short-term room-wide effects that would target enemies of the druid 
in a manner similar to the way groves do now. This change would serve a dual 
purpose, as it would provide a use for naturalism trees while also serving to 
make druids more viable in out-of-grove combat. To prevent abuse, porting a 
grove to a room that already has seed effects active would automatically disable
the seeds, so that their effects could not stack with the normal regimen of 
grove abilities.
Solution #2:
Allow druids to imprint or port a grove to a room with a naturalism tree. This 
does not address many of the underlying issues of naturalism trees, but it would
at least make it so the trees themselves are not detrimental to druids.

Skillset    : Naturalism     Skillname   : Tornado/new
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Naturalism tornado is the transcendent skill of Naturalism, yet it is completely
negated by two common defences, levitation and mass. At most, it is a minor 
annoyance, tossing people to a random room in the same area, and at worst, it is
a tactic which targets and severely damages novices and unprepared 
non-combatants. Unlike the other storms, tornado only affects one room at a 
time, which means even beyond its fundamental design problems the odds of it 
even having an opportunity to do anything are very slim, despite its prohibitive
conditions for summoning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Delete tornado entirely, and create a new Transcendent skill in Naturalism 
called "Resoluteness". A druid with this skill would be able to conjure any of 
the storms without needing to have humidity, temperature, and wind speed within 
the normal necessary ranges. Conjuring a storm outside its normal parameters 
would have an additional mana cost, and a slightly increased equilibrium time. 
In turn, it would let druids keep storms maintained in an area without needing 
to spend minutes keeping the weather ranges tuned to the storm they wish to 
create.
Solution #2:
Change tornado to be an area-ranged, targetted effect. Rather than moving about 
the area and flinging all unmassed targets to random locations, have the druid 
CONJURE TORNADO <target> and, if the target is unmassed, have it bring them to 
the druid instantly, in a manner similar to Devotion's "Deliverance" ability. If
the target does not have levitation applied, allow fall damage and limb breaks 
to be applied to the target normally. Along with this, make a tornado much 
easier to summon, requiring only a thunderstorm or a hailstorm as a prequisite.

Solution #1:
Give Templars an ability in Devotion that lets them paint holy symbols on

balance the same way as Feint does, meaning that the continued offense would be 
limited to a single kick or a double punch after the khp.

Problem:
Monks currently have no blocking ability, allowing their target to simply leave 
the area of attack, and essentially deny the monk any chance of waging an 
offense -unless- the target wishes to stand and fight.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Grant monks a new skill in Taekate, similar to the Deathknight engage, allowing 
the monk to put up a defense that will strike the target as they turn to flee, 
causing them to not be able to leave the room. Same balance and equib costs 
would apply, meaning that the monk is required to put the skill up again once 
the target attempts to leave.
Solution #2:
Give monks the ability to 'block' in a single direction.

Problem:
The Priest profession in Imperian, while powerful defensively suffers from an 
predictable and slow offense with multiple random effects outside of the control
of the user.  This leads to a frustrating experience of missed kill windows and 
a feeling of a lack of offensive control.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the afflictions from Chasten to be chosen. In addition to Chasten 
<target>, it allow Chasten <target> <affliction>. This would allow for more 
control in Priest combat. This targeted chasten could ignore blackout if deemed 
necessary.
Solution #2:
Allow the afflictions from Chasten to be imbued onto the mace for use with 
Smite.  The imbue would require significant equilibrium so that it would not be 
easy to change mid-fight.  However this would allow the Priest to choose an 
affliction ahead of time that would be delivered on demand. This imbued smite 
could disallow blackout if deemed necessary.
Solution #3:
Expand the list of Chatsen-able afflictions to include some physical afflictions
and to be selectable like Solution #1.  This will allow a greater variety of 
afflictions that a Priest can afflict.

Unlike the vast majority of ranged damage attacks (Doppleganger warp, Cataclysm 
staffcast, Grove lightning, Longshot, etc) Kai Choke completely ignores the 
shield tattoo, being only susceptible to a specific high Survival defense that 
drops at the slightest provocation but can otherwise be kept up nigh

no alternative and those with can easily shrug it off as long as necessary.

Solution #1:
Adjust kai choke to be stopped by the shield tattoo, while adjusting Breathing 
to be a defense along the lines of Grounding that consumes the first 
asphyxiation attack to hit it.
Solution #2:
As solution 1, but rather than altering Breathing to be like the widely disliked
Grounding, change it to be a defense granting a minor reduction in asphyxiation 
damage (15-20%, somewhere on par with most miniskills/elixir resistances). This

Skillset    : Groves         Skillname   : Join
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Historically, Druids have been immortal in one room at a time, that room being 
their groves, ported or permanent, and this has been the balancing factor for 
them being weak everywhere else. Today, any natural room can be easily 
transformed into a grove and there are few limitations as to where a Druid can 
be effective, which is as it should be. The problem now is that with the change 
to the skills that previously required a join, it has become evident that Druids
are not only immortal in their groves, but quite powerful in every room in the 
area. One Druid can singlehandedly lock down an entire area with trap and 
forestbind while simultaneously attacking up to 20 people or 30 people as the 
case may be with proning winds, shield breaking meteors and lightning storms 
capable of doing  anywhere from 70 to 150 damage, passively. All while the Druid
can cast additional lightning storms at the target from the safety of the grove.
Two Druids and the entire area can be flooded in addition to the above, and 
should a group decide to charge the grove, the Druid can easily eject all or 
instantly displace him or herself out of the grove should s/he choose.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Limit all of the abilities that previously required a join to the Druid's grove.
One individual having the ability to impact every room in an area at the same 
time is ridiculous, especially because the Druid is not lacking in abilities 
when it comes to bringing the target to the grove. This solution at least gives 
whomever the Druid is targetting a chance to get out of the area, or to find a 
path/urban environment to prevent certain death.

Skillset    : Weaponry       Skillname   : Targetting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
One of the gripes with targetting that I personally have as a player with a 
decent amount of latency is that you need to have balance to target. Thus, with 
a higher ping, you need to wait for the confirmation that you have regained 
balance before you can send the command to target another leg for a break, and 
sending the command to attack, thus causing you to be unable to chase balance as
well as you would want to be able to, as well as cause you to lose valuable time
when performing a multiple limb break.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make targetting able to work when you are off complete body balance. This serves
as a convenience to fighters to better chase balance, and has no effect on 
combat balance. However it has to not work when you -have- any limb balances 
remaining. The point of this is because that if targetting were to work off all 
balances, the only class that would benefit from the view of combat balance are 
the wardancers, who now would be able to do multiple limb breaks in one combo 
balance. In order to maintain the combat balance, but yet still include this 
convenience, I propose that targetting off balance requires you to have all limb
balances(arm balances), so that the only classes that won't be able to use the 
new targetting system midcombo are monks(who don't even need it) and 
wardancers(so that they remain in their current state of combat balance)

methods are damage, afflictions or cleave. None of those are particularly

Solution #1:
A new skill - AB DEVOTION INQUISITION. This would be a limb damage-based

within their own body.
Solution #2:
A new skill with the same name, INQUISITION. It would require the target to have
broken legs, be prone, and have torso damage. The Inquisition skill would grant 
the Templar two abilities - INQUIRE <target>, which would ensnare the target 
with their sins if prone, and when ensnared with this ability, one can CONDEMN 
<target>, killing them instantly. Inquire would take roughly 3 seconds of 
equilibrium, and it would be unable to be writhed out off while the victim has 
torso damage. CONDEMN <target> would burn their souls within their bodies, 
locking them away with their sins. This would solve the problem of viable 
Templar instakills, and allow for a slightly different method of killing.

Problem:
The solution to an indoor target being able to completely negate a summoner's 
doppleganger attack was to enhance the abilities of Lycantha. While in principle
this was an excellent approach, in practice it was not effective. Lycantha has 
many things going against it as a stealthy, remote shield breaker for a 
summoner, such as its incessant howling third-party message a target receives, 
the inability to get past certain barriers, its long, variable trip to the 
actual destination, and most importantly, a lack of notification when the hound 
actually arrives at its destination. Dopple glance is simply not an effective 
counter to the latter point.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Keep the random time and barrier restrictions on Lycantha. Eliminate the 
third-party howling spam (or have a howl message at the time the hound is 
ordered to seek), and have Lycantha send a message to the summoner if and when 
it shreds a shield, somewhat akin to how a summoner can see when a doppleganger 
executes a remote attack.

Skillset    : Enslavery      Skillname   : Piridon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
There exist significant defenses that impact the ability of a ranged 
doppleganger, notably grove exorcism and the banishment rite. These defenses are
supposed to severely restrict a summoner's remote offense. However, there is a 
difference between severe restriction and nullification due to how system 
latency works. Summoners accept the reality of a "one and done" attack pattern 
with a doppleganger in these circumstances, but the natural latency involved in 
the multi-step process of mentally sending orders to a doppleganger means that 
in nearly half of the cases, the dopple cannot get even a single attack off 
against these defenses before it is destroyed and needs resummoned.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
For optional brief balance/equi cost, allow the summoner to attach Dameron 
(minion) to the doppleganger (or have follow) before sending it off to attack. 
As Dameron must be destroyed before a doppleganger in banishment defenses, this 
would allow Piridon to execute at least one attack before it (along with 
Dameron) is destroyed. The drawback is that you need to summon both demons back 
before the next round, doubling the time cost of the constant dopple 
action/banish/resummon dopple cycle.
Solution #2:
A simpler solution would be to provide the doppleganger with a minor bit of 
"resistance" that would allow it to survive the first pulse of a banishment rite
or grove exorcism tic. This would address the latency issues but not otherwise 
have a signficiant effect on mechanics of the skill.

Vortex movement towards the runelorist is currently blocked by walls. A target 
flying on the other side of the wall is pulled straight over the wall, 
completely negating its effectiveness. In an environment where realism doesn't 
always guide game mechanics, rationalizations of, "the wall wasn't -that- tall" 
do not seem satisfactory. Additionally, as both flying or burrowing move you 
into "above" and "below" plane states and require balance to do so, the net 
effect of dragging a flyer over and down is equivalent to two moves, which runs 
counter to the intent of the vortex skill.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
A flying individual hit by vortex is immediately brought to the ground on the 
same side of the wall they started on. The net effect is what anyone dealing 
with vortex on the ground would be facing, and the target would have to invest 
balance time if they wanted to re-fly.
Solution #2:
A flyer dragged over a wall via vortex stays flying. It doesn't address the wall
problem, but it does address the "two moves in one vortex tic" issue and thus 
would be a secondary option.

Skillset    : Hypnosis       Skillname   : Seal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The lead time to first establish a hypnotic trance, numerous suggestion 
balances, uncomboable seal balance, and the mandatory delay before the first 
affliction takes place mandates Hypnosis be a very complicated skillset to use 
well. An Assassin must effectively plan 30 seconds ahead, all the while either 
slowing their offense to suggest between attacks or fighting without illusions 
to do their suggestions offbalance. And while the time delay is hindering by 
itself, what the skillset really lacks through all of this planning is the 
ability to be reactive. In the best of possible scenarios, even a pre-sealed 
suggestion stack will not hit exactly when it needs to. Fixing this without 
disrupting the role of Hypnosis and the 'feel' of the skillset has presented a 
challenge over many years of classleads.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a unique skill near the middle of Hypnosis called 'Awaken'. Once gained, an 
Assassin can SEAL <person> WITH <suggestion>, startling the victim out of their 
trance with a command that takes place immediately. An awakening seal attack 
would have a unique message in lieu of the normal snap message, and the rest of 
the stack could then take place following all of the normal rules and 
limitations of Hypnosis. Awaken adds an alternative to delaying the first 
affliction, while still allowing it for situations where it would be beneficial 
to wait.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
This is not an exact skill problem, but I believe that it does pose a problem 
for novice Druids. Most novices dabble in combat eventually, and Druids cannot 
get any practice with grove skills in the arena unless they have reached the 
Transcendent level. This discourages novices interested in combat to remain in 
Druid guilds because they're reduced to a single skillset in arena combat.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Move the Portability skill to be immediately after the Quarterstaff skill. This 
will provide young Druids with the ability to get combat practice in the arena, 
without creating an imbalance because they will not have many environments 
available, nor Evolution. It will not affect Druids who are already 
Transcendent, it will only make the class more accessible to novices.

Skillset    : Devotion       Skillname   : Redemption
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Redemption is a generally unliked abilitiy that needs removal. For the 
devotioner, it does little aside from wasting his or her devotion, and for the 
opponent, it is naught but an annoyance. However, it would be silly to simply 
remove a trans skill with no replacement.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove the Redemption ability (see report 40 for the Priest profession's 
replacement). Replace it with the Templar-only skill, Righteousness. This 
ability would use around 3s of equilibrium to activate/deactivate and would be a
toggled, unstrippable defence with the following effects: 1.) Drains the user's 
devotion at a rate of around 1% devotion every thirty seconds. 2.) Increases 
base damage of the user's Flare ability by approximately 15%.  All numbers are 
tentative and open to balancing, but are most preferred modifiers.
Solution #2:
As solution #1, with the addition of 15% magick damage resistance while the 
ability is active.
Solution #3:
Remove the Redemption abilitiy. Replace it with the Templar-only skill, Infuse. 
With activation costs and a drain similar to that in Solution #1, this ability 
would cause a weapon chosen by the Templar (Using INFUSE <WEAPON> WITH ZEAL or 
something similar) to deal 50% of its damage normally as cutting damage, and 50%
elemental damage (fire? cold? maybe damage type based on the user's chosen 
divine ohoho, in which case I can provide a list if necessary) in a fashion 
similar to colored sitaras. The Templar class has been built to this point to 
rely on its damage-dealing capabilities, and a damage class based around cutting
damage simply cannot compete in today's world without a large number of passives
and a half-health instakill (See: Bonders). Any weapon infused by a Templar can 
only be wielded by that Templar until the effect is cancelled (simply INFUSION 
OFF, in case the weapon is misplaced), and a Templar can only use infusion on 
one weapon at a time. If this solution is chosen, solutions #1 and #2 should be 
ignored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Predators are one of the easiest professions to escape from, the only 
"hindering" abilities possessed by the profession being rendered ineffective by 
the mass salve, a defence kept up almost universally among combatants. Also, the
smokebomb ability in its current incarnation is relatively useless, granting no 
significant advantages to escape attempts when used.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Keeping the current creation costs and balance used when activated, change the 
smokebomb to create a short-term movement hindering effect, giving it around a 
33% chance to stop movement attempts and disrupt balance, similar to the Piety 
and Gravehands abilities. However, this ability would affect all non predators 
in the room, and have a much shorter duration, lasting around thirty seconds. 
This would make the ability impractical for usage in groups. If necessary, place
the ability higher in the skillset than it is currently.

As Solution #1, but increasing the balance and/or commodity costs of the 
smokebomb item as the administration sees fit.

Skillset    : Knifeplay      Skillname   : Jab
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The predator profession has often been called "monk lite plus stealth", yet one 
of the flaws in this assessment is that aside from dealing with rebounding in 
addition to shield, the Predator profession lacks the ability to set up their 
breaks quite as effectively. Specifically, the stance flow of the Knifeplay Jab 
attack, which targets the arms, is unnecessarily awkward. Since the damage of 
the Predator's primary finishing ability, crescentcut, is wholly dependant on 
applying modifiers to the foe, most of which are based on limb breaks, it stands
to reason that the profession should have the ability to effectively achieve 
these modifiers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Alter the stance flow of Jab to be identical to that of Lowhook, allowing the 
move to be used thrice in succession or in a combination of a feint and two 
jabs.
Solution #2:
Alter the stance flow of Jab to be identical to that of Crescentcut, allowing 
the move to be used thrice in succession or in a combination of a feint and two 
jabs, but limiting its usage in combination with lowhooks.
Solution #3:
Alter the stance flow of Jab entirely to the new flow of E -> R <-> L, G -> V, N
-> E, and unusable in Vae-sant. This would allow the move to be  used repeatedly
on its own, while heavily restricting its use in combinations with lowhook.

Problem:

Problem:
Mage combat has been relatively unmodified for many years, and recent changes as
well as the relative increase in damage soaking capability game-wide has 
diminished their primary approach to combat - that of damage and more damage - 
considerably. In the interests of diversifying potential avenues of Mage combat,
new abilities are being proposed with the hopes of offering alternatives to its 
currently extremely straightforward nature.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a new Crystalism ability, Pulse. This ability allows the Mage to call one of
his vibrations to pulse immediately at a target, dealing its normal effect to 
them. This ability would ideally work with balance and not require the Mage to 
have equilibrium if that equilibrium was used by select other abilities (ideally
not working with certain powerful abilities such as Stormhammer). Specific 
vibrations would have their own cooldown, preventing the Mage from pulsing the 
same vibe repetitively. This ability would not function in Retardation, as that 
vibration's overpowering effects drown out the Mage's attempt to call others to 
action.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Assassins/Renegades depend of their capability to intelligently stack toxins in 
their opponents. The problem is that most toxins don't have curing messages, 
leaving it as an exercise to the toxin user to figure out what toxin was cured 
depending on the herb eaten. Increasing the dificulty of this assessment is the 
use of focus and purge blood, the latter even lacking have a room-wide message 
when used. Adding curing messages to some of the less used toxins (aka, any 
toxin apart of hemotoxin, calotropis, ciguatoxin and metrazol) would give an 
additional edge to professions that already have an advantage in affliction 
speed over sabotage users, like sabre knights and diabolists.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
A new ability, Discern. When activated, either on a specific person or everyone 
in the room, the toxin user has a 40-50% change of detecting when a toxin that 
he is able to preserve has been cured. This way, afflictions that aren't toxin 
based wouldn't be detected. As an additional balancing factor, the ability could
fire in toxins than already have a curing message. Message suggestion: You 
discern that <aff name> has been cleansed from <name>'s body.
Solution #2:
Same like #1, but it would fire when any toxin-based affliction is cured, with a
lowered detection percentage, like 25-33%.

Skillset    : Runelore       Skillname   : Carve
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Carve lets you sketch a rune into your target's body, which will last until they
apply restoration to the torso. There are several problems with this ability 
though: > it is channeled, meaning you can't do anything until it completes, 
taking balance AFTER it, so you can't do any action during 3 seconds, then are 
off balance for 1.5s (as Fast) > if the target has both a broken torso and carve
and applies restoration to torso, carve gets cured first > the target can apply 
restoration when it starts and by the time the Runeguard has recovered balance, 
the carving is already cured.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Change Carve to an ability that would allow you to sketch a rune directly into 
the ground with the sword. This ability would bypass water in the room, either 
natural or because of an ability/artifact. It would last a limited time, between
5 and 10 minutes, wouldn't be imbibable by devotioners, smudgeable by druids or 
chamined by bards. It also wouldn't count against normal sketching of runes in 
the room. The rune carved would fire at the same rate than the present carve 
against the Runeguard's enemies present in the room.
Solution #2:
Same as #1, but instead of the rune regularly firing by itself, allow it to be 
CALLed, affecting either a specific person or everyone in the room, even the 
Runeguard if necessary, in a comboable eq based ability.
Solution #3:
Keep the ability in its present form, except turning it into an incurable 
affliction that would last between 10 and 15 seconds, allowing a window for the 
Runeguard to press in either damage or afflictions, depending of the rune used.

Skillset    : Shielddance    Skillname   : Stun
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
As described in Announce 1133, Shield Knockout was made both parryable and 
affected by rebounding, because of its capacity to incapacitate a person 
unstoppably during a brief period, specially because it was comboable. In the 
same announce, Shield Stun was changed to be affected by rebounding, but no 
parry. The situation arises because Shield Stun is used to the same effect than 
old Knockout, thanks to it being comboable with Shielddance/Bladedance raze. In 
the case there is no aura up, it means a free toxin delivery for the Wardancers,
who already have passive razing/afflicting with Eviscerate, specially after the 
DoubleDance ability was introduced. Also, the speed of Shield Stun means that 
the WD, with a buckler or equivalent arti shield, will regain balance 
practically at the same time the stun wears off, unlike most stun abilities, 
making it possible to chain stuns, even with diminishing returns, to maintain 
the enemy on hold while they heal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make Shield Stun being parryable. It would be still viable thanks to comboable 
Blade Feint, but won't allow the delivery of toxins unless the target ignores 
the use of parry completely
Solution #2:
Keep the balance as it is now, but increase the balance taken by at least 1 
second, giving a window for the target to counter. In comparison, knight's 
battlecry last at least two more seconds than the stun, even with a diadem and 
equilibrium bonus.

maidenhair afflictions every 10 seconds. It was justified that it wouldn't use 
equilibrium/balance because of the lack of passive curing abilities of the

Skillset    : Elemancy       Skillname   : Convergance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
As is Convergance is a waste of space in the mages skill arsenal. It takes about
12 seconds and 4 actions,  and during this time the elements wear off to quick. 
Not to mention the target may simply walk away and return a moment later, and 
the process has to begin all over again. This needs to be fixed so that mages 
don't need to rely on retardation/behead combo.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Converge can stand to stay at a 12 second kill time, but make it 1 action 
instead of 4. That casts a single type of elemental kill of the users choice. 
Make it the 12 seconds on a count down timer, during which time the mage can 
attack the target, while still allowing the target to kill the mage or leave the
area.
Solution #2:
Keep it single action and 12 second count down, but instead of being able to 
attack the target. let the mage at least use transfix or hailstorm.
Solution #3:
If not solutions 1 or 2, then make the Convergance skill 1 action that can pass 
through Cataclysm so that the mages have a way to counter monks. If the kill 
fails then whatever individual elemental kill type was choosen will instead 
strip the targets defence against that element

Skillset    : Elemancy       Skillname   : Elementals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Right now taking on the form of an element drains constant willpower much like 
blackwind and or astralform. However, due to Transcendent Frost, Transcendent 
Thermology, Transcendent Galvanism the forms are pretty much useless. As they 
drain constant willpower and if the target has transcendent skills it negates 
almost half the damage done by staffcasting or any other elemental attack that a
mage would use. The staffcasts damage is delt both on Magick and Elements. Even 
if you're using horripilation which is COLD damage, half the ability is 
consisted of a Magick attack and a Cold attack. If Transcendent Frost and 
constitution you're looking at around 25% or more in reduction just off a few 
hundred lessons. Adding resistance ring, the resistance ability, runes, or 
artifacts will overly reduce the damage even greater. As some forms do different
things, such as taking on aquais it will increase cold damage. As over a period 
of time classleads have been dropping the damage done by these forms. As 
Athletic has a cold weakness if in aquais with a level 3 sash, level 3 collar 
vsing an Athletic you're looking at 160 damage MAX if no resistances at all. 
With resistances it greatly depends on skills and or abilities even artifacts 
for that matter. As most mages don't have artifacts, they are looking around 
60-80 damage normally when attacking a target without resistances.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Reduce the willpower drain by half when taking a form of an element. This will 
equal out the balance for mages. As adding clarity, telesense or other willpower
and mana draining abilities it will significantly drain willpower at an INSANE 
rate.

Problem:
Stacking rebounding and shield is an exceedingly simple, and very effective 
detour to the offense of any weapon using profession. This classlead is intended

Solution #1:
Simply edit how RSL works currently with slower weapons i.e. Broadswords and 
Battleaxes. If your target has shield OR rebounding up, the RSL would act as it 
does now, razing and then slashing your foe. If your target has shield AND 
rebounding up, the RSL would raze both, sacrificing the slash for a second raze.

Problem:
Tipslash is the basic hunting attack for a young Amazon or Ranger. Currently, 
with basic 12 strength as an Astute which is the normal statpack for young kids 
these days does roughly 20-25 damage per tipslash. Tipslash fires every 2.75 
seconds depending on Warding skill and statpack, as well as the glaives speed. 
Standard quality glaives, as an astute runs 2.75. Untill they either get FEND 
which is near Virtuoso it will double the amount of damage, but it douples the 
amount of balance taken as well. Qjab is an effective bashing skill, however 
unless Transcendent it misses almost every time. This would also depend on 
artifacts, however most common novices won't know or buy credits untill they 
have learned the basic structure of this realm.

Skillset    : Telepathy      Skillname   : Mindprint
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Mindprint, the transcendent telepathy skill, offer a significant advantage to a 
monk trying to lock a target. The issue is that any benefit to halving the lock 
time is minimal if the monk cannot hold a successful lock, which is still a 
persistent concern. A mindprint should be instrumental in raising the telepathy 
success involved in both formulas (lock and hold).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
A mindprint adds an arbitrary amount of mana (between 150-200) to the monk's 
current pool for the purpose of the lock break formula only (current mana + 
telepathy vs current mana + philosophy, assuming the formula listed in the file 
is the actual one used). It would not have any impact on the actual mana of the 
monk. Because of the increased effectiveness of a mindprint, mindprints would 
have a decay life and the number of stored mindprints would be reduced by half 
(to five).
Solution #2:
A mindprint makes an achieved lock unbreakable unless the target or monk leave 
the area, one or the other dies, the monk dissolves the lock, etc. Due to the 
increased effectiveness of mindprints, the two restrictions listed in Solution 1
would be in effect, along with an additional restriction of the monk needing an 
increased, uninterruptable balance/equi time to finish the mindprint. This would
restrict the lock/print/forget practice currently in use.

Skillset    : Telepathy      Skillname   : Lock
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Per the AB TELEPATHY LOCK file, "Once you have a lock, every 15 seconds, the 
locked mind automatically gets a chance to break the lock." This is not how the 
formula works in practice, and locks are routinely broken in mere seconds after 
they are achieved. Either the timer of the current break attempt erroneously 
starts at when a lock is attempted (rather than achieved), or there is a 
universal timer, or the actual employed formula is something else entirely, the 
net result is that monks do not necessarily hold a lock for a minimum of fifteen
seconds.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Verify the formula for breaking a lock is working as listed in AB TELEPATHY 
LOCK. If working off a universal timer, have the timer tied to the individual 
monk and start when the lock is achieved.

Problem:
Currently, StandReady fires upon anyone who enters the room. This limits the

line, and change the Ranger's in-room appearance to reflect their status, unless
they are using "conceal wielded" (Conceal in Trailblazing). The status message

Problem:
Retardation when layed, eats a vibe up every 4 seconds. Which basically means 
that you have only 84 seconds or shorter to kill your opponent before your 
entire offense is gone.

Solution #1:
Create a new skill to allow a mage to summon forth all 21 vibes, with a balance 
cost of 15 seconds. The skill would need to be unforceable, but also would be 
fair to the opponent as they could use one of many insta-kills to kill the mage.

Skillset    : Devotion       Skillname   : Hellsight
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Hellsight is a decent affliction skill that is currently cured by tree tattoo, 
pipe smoking and the focus affliction. It is hard to balance this skill because 
in its active form, it is off set by the equilibrium use of the skill. In its 
passive form, the afflictions from hellsight itself and the active affliction 
from the Malignist make the focus and tree cure of hellsight a necessity. The 
result is nightmare's hellsight is useful and amazing and devotions hellsight is
ineffective and thus rarely ever used.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove the focus and tree cures from DEVOTION hellsight. In addition, make the 
first tick of hellsight cause -two- afflictions and one affliction with every 
other tick.
Solution #2:
If Solution 1 is not possible, allow for the recreation of hellsight and name it
Atonement or something similar. Allow it to function like solution 1.
Solution #3:
Remove hellsight from the focus affliction and tree affliction lists and change 
the cure from smoking laurel to eating an herb such as nightshade, orphine or 
wormwood...preference in that order from most awesome to least.

Fox and wolf are hunter ents that help the hunter do some damage. Currently, the

Problem:
Necromancers can possess mobs that use aeon and concussion. Considering the 
skills available to the two Necromancy-users, this seems like an unnecessary 
addition, even if they die quickly. It, at the very least, allows them a 
powerful opener, which may very well easily kill those who are unaware of the 
creature and its afflicting power. For example, Hycanthus uses aeon, and then 
there's Hysaara, who uses concussion.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Disable aeon, concussion and other extreme afflictions from being given by 
possessed mobs. If it's more than paralysis, stupidity, a trip, or arm and/or

Skillset    : Necromancy     Skillname   : Exterminate
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Exterminate is a fairly useless skill, and only serves to incite cases of forest
enemying. Forest enemying is the real problem here, and this is the only way I 
can think of to have it limited or removed. Forest enemying is incredibly 
overpowered, especially considering that if you become enemied to, for example, 
'khandava forests', you actually become enemied to Sienna, Egeria, Khandava and 
Yhumara (if I've not forgotten any). In each forest room (most of which are far 
from the council which enemied you) you get hit for insane damage, even if just 
passing through. If there isn't a need to  protect them from exterminate (which 
is the primary purpose of the enemy status, since the whole 'Civilisation vs. 
Nature is mostly non-existent RP), then there won't be a need to forest enemy. 
Similarly, forest fires created by skills such as inferno/firelord need to be 
adjusted, so that forest enemying might viably be removed or limited 
appropriately.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Limit exterminate to areas with a Demonic influence only. Change forest fires to
affect only the room the were started in, as compared to setting the whole 
forest on fire. Also limit forest enemying to the forests immediately adjacent 
the council. Khandva forest, Western Celidon forest, Ithaquan forest.
Solution #2:
Limit exterminate to areas with a Demonic influence only. Forest fires would 
need to work the same as in solution 1. Remove forest enemying completely 
(solution 1 would be preferable if this is not an option)
Solution #3:
Remove exterminate completely. Either remove forest fires, or preferably limit 
them to the room the were started in. Either remove forest enemying or apply the
restrictions named in solution 1.

Skillset    : Chivalry       Skillname   : New
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
One of the major problems facing knights now is that the rebounding aura can be 
crippling to the offense of a damage knight. With DSL times of 3.5 to 4 seconds,
damage knights can very easily end up in a situation where their offense is 
"dsl, raze, dsl, raze, etc", and they do not have an offense that is capable of 
stoppping the enemy from using linseed constantly. This classlead is designed to
alleviate the problem knights have in dealing with rebounding while leaving the 
rebounding mechanic itself unchanged.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
The addition of a new skill, tentatively named "berserker stance". This skill 
would allow the knight to take a two-handed grip on either a broadsword or a 
battleaxe, forgoing the use of a shield. The knight would maintain the stance 
until he chose to drop it, or until he unwielded his weapon or began to wield a 
shield, and it would permit the knight to move freely. The knight would not do 
any extra damage, but would instead be capable of breaking through rebounding 
with the raw brute force of his strikes. DSLs while in berserker stance would 
break through the rebounding aura and strike for full damage on both hits of the
DSL. This skill would not work with sabres, as the lighter and faster sabre 
lacks the power to batter its way through the rebounding aura.

Druid to create their grove anywhere, put up Maelstrom and continuously assault 
any of their enemies who enter the area, regardless of where the Druid is.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give Maelstrom a draining effect on grove energy, rather than a one time 
expenditure. This prevents Maelstrom from being a fire-and-forget passive that 
hits an entire area.
Solution #2:
Cause Maelstrom to end when the Druid leaves their grove, and if necessary, 
begin again when they reenter. This will prevent Maelstrom from targetting a 
populated area while the Druid sits safely behind siege.

Skillset    : Knifeplay      Skillname   : Knifethrowing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Knifethrowing at this point is quite useless. The damage is so low and it's very
easy to get out of it. Even if you'd quad break and throw this on someone who's 
prone, ANY combo is a better choice. Not to mention that you need to LEAVE the 
room, which makes it even more ridiculous. For an ability that's so high up in 
the skill tree, it deserve better.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make it possible to throw the sitara from within the same room. But in addition 
to the low bleeding damage it's causing, it'll slowly kill the target. The time 
for this would be about 12 seconds from the initial throw. In order to pull it 
out, you need atleast one arm and you can be prone. This will generate in an 
instant kill if not cured before the 12 seconds have passed.
Solution #2:
Same as above only that you as the attacker must maintain the knife and press it
into the body of the target. The requirement for this however would be that the 
target must be prone to begin with. When the target has one arm cured and no 
longer prone, they can push the attacker away from them, and pulling the knife 
out at the same time. In order to make it useable, it would have to stop 
tumbling as well, for the period you maintain this on the target.
Solution #3:
Same as solution #2 only that you can tumble from it in order to escape. When 
doing so, however, you get afflicted by torso damage and start to bleed heavily.
To cure the torso damage, you need to apply restoration to it once.

Skillset    : Predation      Skillname   : Twinshot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently Twinshot is too slow to generate something in a 1 vs 1 scenario. The 
use comes more with team combat. The speed with fast statpack and standing in 
Vae-sant is 2.5 seconds. Anyone with basic knowledge can cure out of that 
without a sweat. Even when combined with a limb break, twinshot wouldn't be good
enough. This is because, at the moment, we're more effective when using 
Knifeplay alone. To start getting near effective speed of this ability, you need
to buy a level 2 or 3 dartsheath. Only then you're getting close to 2s and 
probably 1.75s with the level 3, if even that, which makes it onpar with a 
wardancers flick in terms of speed. Having to buy artifacts in order use your 
abilities is NOT an option. Changing Twinshot would be a step in the right 
direction since there's the Cirisosis toxin that allows you to kill someone if 
you're able to intelligently afflict someone, no matter how much health they 
have. Along with that kind of change, we'd get an alternative for the limb 
breaking and damage kills that we're so very limited to at the moment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Pull down the speed of Twinshot in Vae-sant stance to 2 seconds using fast 
statpack, making a level 1 dartsheath land at 2 seconds (but still higher 
accuracy), level 2 at 1.75s and level 3 at 1.5s. In addition to this, let aura 
of rebounding stop darts. With no passive abilities afflicting the target, these
numbers should be reasonable.
Solution #2:
Keep the current speed of Twinshot but allow you to combine it with one 
knifeplay move (not one knifeplay combo, but a knifeplay ability such as jab, 
lowhook, etc). This will allow you to afflict with three toxins in one move 
while aura of rebounding will stop the darts and the sitara. The knifeplay move 
would be at the beginning, followed by the Twinshot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Druids lack any form of combat worth outside of natural areas, making the class 
frustratingly feeble for a large percentage of fights.  While it cannot be 
denied that a druid within their grove is a decent powerhouse, I don't see this 
as a justification for making them basically useless outside of one, no other 
class is so utterly crippled in so many popular fight locations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
A new entity summoning ability at trans Naturalism, tentatively called a Treant,
at a grove energy cost of 4000 energy (which becomes the Treants base energy 
allowance, none regenerating).  The Treant would mimic a Seraphs following, and 
lack of interactability, wouldn't stack with either a second Treant and would be
dismissed if it entered a grove (returning its left over store of energy to the 
owners grove when it goes).  I would advise limited grove abilities with a 
Treant, my suggestions being Thorns, Entangle, Gate, Guardian, Calling, Hive, 
Flash, Hypercure, Roots, Screen.  An easier to read version of this suggestion

Problem:
Maelstrom, recently made accessible due to the removal of joining is just too 
much passive damage to be in any form considered balanced.  Even without the 
relevant artifacts, essentially free hits of 40 or 75 damage (And this with 10 
int) against every enemy, area wide is just silly, once artifacts are factored 
into the equation the damage is vastly worse, given both thunderstorm and 
maelstrom both benefit greatly from collar and sash, each striking for upwards 
of 130 damage -passively-.

Solution #1:
Significantly reduce Maelstroms lighting damage output, and/or lower the % 
chance of lightning proc'ing in comparison to the other two somewhat less 
crippling maelstrom effects.

Remove the effect of Maelstrom when inside its originating grove, this would

Skillset    : Survival       Skillname   : Curseward
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Deadeyes, and to a lesser extent swiftcurse, are powerful afflicting engines. 
They can have the speed of a sabre knight, but with none of the downsides, such 
as rebounding. Plus, Diabolists have access to mobs that give them extra useful 
afflictions (off-bal, chills, etc), which further give  them an edge in combat. 
Further, sabre knights only have access to the toxins, while Diabolists have the
afflictions in evileye, PLUS toxins with their daegger. Their versatility is 
unmatched any class, with their main skill's (Evileye) only real counter, 
Curseward, taking 4.25 + 3 seconds to put up.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove the equilibrium cost from curseward, but maintain the delay of 7.25 
seconds and the 22 mana cost. This would still allow three potential sets of 
deadeyes before curseward is up again and a breach is required; however, it 
would also allow a semblance of resistance from their victim, but still at a 
potential benefit to Diabolists. If someone were to use it repeatedly, the 
Diabolist would have the option of a few saps to lead up to, or an outright 
catharsis. And this would be especially easy to do if someone were using focus 
and curseward together.
Solution #2:
Same as above, but make the delay for curseward 6.25 seconds. A Fast deadeyes 
takes 2.5 seconds, which means that they would get only two deadeyes before a 
potential breach would be required.
Solution #3:
If none of the above is acceptable, reduce the mana cost to 7. Curseward is 
worthless as it is without a huge mana cost associated with it.

While in theory stonewalls are better than their equivalents, Piety and

leave their own stonewalled room with any measure of ease. Also, several classes
have ways to bypass walls (warding vault, predation wolfvault, wardance 
backflip, bonding leap, bard's earthquake have a chance to destroy them, 
necromancers and summoners, even with the delay, can use blackwin/astralform to 
escape. In outdoors room, those that can fly) leaving the Runelorist with the 
options of using raido to get out (assuming there is no monolith/holy groud) or 
tumbling, that will require the runeguard to waste time touching cloak before 
running/giving chase.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add to Gular the ability to SKETCH GULAR ON STONEWALL <dir> that would, after a 
delay similar to when the rune is sketched in the ground (2 seconds as fast

Problem:
Incinerate currently instakills victims at 50% health after 18s of preparing 
flame. While this is pretty amazing and a fun way to kill, the existence of 
Incinerate makes it hard to balance any affliction, damage or momentum building 
skills for Hunters and Druids. The result is that Arboreals and Hunters stay 
pretty linear and have to tiptoe with their upgrades to avoid anything that 
makes it too easy to slip a target into the 50% range. I won't even mention the 
effects of incinerate on team combat, but we all know how that goes. Accepting 
downgrades to incinerate allows us more leeway to suggest new and more 
interesting upgrades to outdated skills.

Set Incinerate's instakill value at 25%
Solution #2:
Remove the instakill of incinerate from the druid bonding and leave it in hunter
bonding at 25%.
Solution #3:
Remove incinerate from both bondings and implement new attacks to replace it. 
You could even replace wyvern with a similar, less fire loving bond for druids 
with custom attacks. Suggestions could be increasing mauls damage or bleed or 
adding in attacks like Khizan's ravage idea that might add afflictions or 
increased damage.

Skillset    : Crystalism     Skillname   : New
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
With the new tactics mentioned in other classlead reports, namely 59, 60, and 
61, the Mage profession gains new options to use in combat. However, the 
profession faces the problem of "sealing the deal", so to speak. Even at full 
afflicting capability with intelligent use of pulse and shard, the moment the 
Mage lets up to apply damage to make a kill, the target will be able to take 
this pause to heal up and recover. The profession needs an ability that will 
allow the Mage to finish their target while sustaining some of their afflicting 
momentum.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a new ability to Crystalism called Overcharge, which will speed up the 
vibration tick rates for Dissipate, Palpitation, Tremors, Creeps, Oscillate, 
Disorientation, Stridulation, Plague, and Lullaby by 50% for 15 seconds, but has
a two minute cooldown after used. It should not function in retardation, and 
embedding retardation with overcharge going should either be impossible or 
immediately return the vibes to their normal rate. This would mean that a 10 
second vibe would "tick" instead at instead at 7.5s, 8s at 6s. This would give 
the Mage a way to continue to apply pressure to a target already on the back 
foot in the hopes to finish their target. However, once the Mage has made an 
attempt, they have lost the opportunity for quite some time.
Solution #2:
Replace Retardation entirely with Overcharge. The very presence of Retardation 
is often used as a rationale to avoid significant alterations to the Mage 
profession. Furthermore, it has been downgraded significantly with the addition 
of one command envenoming/dsling and the like. Overcharge would represent a 
decent replacement for the ability.

Skillset    : Devotion       Skillname   : Inquisition
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
For most professions, there is something to work towards while engaged in 
combat. An end goal that can be achieved if certain requirements are met. For 
some, it involves limb damage, and for some others, it happens when either 
health or mana reaches a certain point. Templars have no such ability, cleave 
and sunder don't count, and the hope of this classlead is to change this by 
providing Templars with  a finishing skill, which they absolutely need to be at 
least competitive in combat.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give Templars a new finisher called inquisition, unlike cleave and sunder. This 
is an open solution, so interpret as you please.
Solution #2:
Give Templars a new finishing skill called Inquisition. The skill would have the
same requirements as Necromancy Vivisection, and function in the exact same way.
While non-unique skills are undesirable, the Templar profession excels at 
nothing, and therefore it is difficult to come up with new and balanced 
abilities to improve them.
Solution #3:
Give Templars a new finishing skill called Inquisition, though different from 
solution 2. This would instantly kill an opponent that is prone, suffering from 
two crippled limbs and with health at or below 40%. This is not a preferred 
solution, so we'd like it to be modified as desired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Transmogrify is inherently impossible to balance as it is now due to the skill's
reliance on the RNG. Your luck with the unmodifiable RNG of Transmog can leave 
you taking 30% less damage while having level three health regen and your health
increased by three points of con. Or, should the RNG be less nice, it can leave 
you taking 30% more damage while sipping for 30% less health while having your 
max health cut by 3 points of con. You cannot balance a class around such a wide
variance of bonuses/penalties. Additionally, fighters are regularly left mogging
away their entire stock of sanguis hoping to get a great mog, or, at the least, 
hoping not to get something that is absolutely crippling. A transcendent skill 
should not require you to sink half or more of your fighting resources into it 
to get a useful effect out of it, and it should never put the user in a position
where using his transcendent skill actually harms his ability to fight.

One of the major irritations with Runelore is that it's impossible to refresh a 
body/weapon/armor rune at a low duration, and the runelorist is forced to either
find a water room to scrub off the existing rune or let the rune expire before 
resketching a new one. This becomes especially irritating when you have to scrub
off a full set of 10 runes and resketch them all.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make it so that if a rune's remaining time is under an hour, you can resketch 
the rune on the item and another full duration of time to the rune.
Solution #2:
Allow runes with less than half an hour of time left on them to be refreshed to 
maximum duration by resketching runes on an item.
Solution #3:
Allow a Runelorist to SMUDGE RUNES ON ME/<weapon>/<armor> to remove all the 
sketched runes on an item, making it possible to remove and resketch runes 
without seeking out a water environment.

Problem:
When a Mage is hit with the toxin oxycodone, he or she is given a message

when a Mage is hit with a weapon that has a knife rune etched on it, there is 
only a generic message signifying that a channel has been damaged.

Skillset    : Elemancy       Skillname   : Geyser
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently, geyser works as a substitute for the tentacle tattoo in every single 
way but one. Inexplicably, geyser is blocked by shield, whereas tentacle is not.
Thus, if a target flies and touches the shield tattoo, or uses any class 
shielding ability, the Mage is unable to pull the target down. It seems 
pointless to have an ability that mimics another in all but one way, thus 
forcing a player to use that ability anyway in order to deal with all 
situations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the geyser ability to bypass the shield tattoo, just as tentacle does, 
thus making geyser an adequate replacement for tentacle.

Skillset    : Predation      Skillname   : Twinshot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently, Rangers, Knights, Wardancers, and Assassins have the ability to 
envenom their weapons at the same time that they strike with them. Predators, 
meanwhile, are forced to use three commands for one twinshot. They need to do 
'dart select <toxin>', 'dart backup <toxin2>' and finally 'twinshot <target>'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Bring Predator twinshot in line with other weapon classes, allowing them to do 
'twinshot <target> <toxin1> <toxin2>.
Solution #2:
Given Knifeplay itself is in a similar situation, allow Predators to 'sitara ___
<target> <toxin>'. However, this can only work once per combo, given Predators 
are only meant to only be able to envenom while on balance. This would go in 
combination with solution 1.

Skillset    : Knifeplay      Skillname   : Crescentcut
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Crescentcut begins with a certain amount of damage, depending on the damage of 
the sitara, the resistances of the target, and the strength of the user. When 
attacking a fellow Predator with an 83 damage ivory sitara with 10 strength, 
each crescentcut does about 35 damage without modifiers. After that, each 
modifier applies what seems to be about a 30% bonus to the sitara attack, 
perhaps slightly less. Thus, each modifier (prone, broken legs (2), broken arms 
(2), broken torso (1), and broken head (1), and the level 2 versions of the 
aforementioned body part damage) adds 10 damage to each crescentcut attack. The 
level 2 breaks are all but unachievable in combat. Practically, a Predator could
hope to achieve 75 damage per crescentcut against someone with leather armor and
a tower shield, or 225 damage. This would be with the target having two broken 
legs, and two broken arms. After that, the damage would decrease significantly 
as the target healed breaks. When compared to someone with upwards of 400 
health, this attack will never kill the target.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give the bonus applied by each modifier a slight boost. Perhaps each modifier 
would add 40% to the damage of each crescentcut, or +14 to a 35 damage 
crescentcut rather than +10.
Solution #2:
Alternately, if solution 1 appears too powerful, boost the modifier provided by 
ciguatoxin (which appears to only apply when the target is already prone) to a 
full 30%, instead of what appears to be about 15%, or half of a normal modifier.

Skillset    : Crystalism     Skillname   : Sonicportal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
In order to enter a sonicportal embedded at a target, the target cannot have the
defense given by rapping a tuningfork, be on a monolith, or be on holyground. 
This is as it should be. However, the Mage is completely unable to embed a 
sonicportal if standing on a monolith. This forces the Mage to leave a city or 
council and find a spot without a monolith before finally embedding the portal, 
likely losing their opportunity if they were attempting to use the portal for an
ambush. Comparatively, a wand of portals can be used while on a monolith, to 
portal to someone not on a monolith/holy ground/rapping a fork.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow sonicportals to be embedded when on a monolith, to someone not on a 
monolith/holy ground/rapping a fork. Allowing them to do the same from holy 
ground would make it a bit too easy to raid in the anti-magick world.

Skillset    : Bowmanship     Skillname   : Broad
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
With artifact bows granting the power of bowmanship to all and Warden arrows 
changing the utility of bowmanship for all who have it, the prevalence of 
certain skill combinations has begun to create a few deadly traps in the vein of
old stun spamming. Broad arrows have a decently long uncon and can be fired 
rapidly even by non-wardens, creating lockdown scenarios where the target has 
less than half a second to react. This can be easily combined with effects like 
Hunter axe stun, Monk telepathy, or Noctu using tarot through their 
dopplegangers to create essentially unstoppable kills from line of sight 
distance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give unconsciousness a 'diminishing return' effect, allowing for timed 
unconsciousness attacks to disable an opponent but preventing situations where 
it can be kept up indefinitely until the target dies.

Allow broad arrows fired by non-wardens to be knocked aside by parry effects 
aimed at the head.

Skillset    : Chivalry       Skillname   : New
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Lack of feasible kill method for the Templar profession, this extends to the 
Runeguard profession. The widespread avaiLabiaity to physical damage reduction, 
shield and rebounding defences as well as surcoats and dodging can effectively 
nullify an offense based on damaging an opponent. This classlead is similar to 
99, submitted by Khizan, but taking further steps to eliminate the issues around
Knight professions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
New ability in Chivalry (tentatively not available to the Brutality profession, 
for a variety of reasons). This ability would be called "Tactics" and would be 
introduced at about mythical in Chivalry. Tactics would introduce two 
"specialisms" to the Chivalry skillset. Precisionstrike and Strikethrough. 
Precisionstrike would change the mechanic of a normal DSL to factor in the 
intelligence of the user, rather than the strength when calculating damage. 
Ideally, a minimum of 14 intelligence would be required for using this ability 
(this would exclude the Fast statpack, although an intelligence artifact would 
allow them to use this tactic). When using this "tactic", intelligence based 
artifacts would effect the strength of the DSL. Mechanics such as razeslash 
would continue to act as normal, aside from the damage dealt. The otherside to 
"Tactics" would be Strikethrough, this would require a minimum of  13 strength, 
(unartifacted Athletic, Normal, Sturdy, Strong and Powerful statpacks), when 
using a DSL with this tactic, the chivalry user would be able to break through 
rebounding and the shield tattoo for 50% damage. Each slash would automatically 
break through the shield, dealing a toxin. Rebounding on its own would minimize 
the damage to 75%, shield and rebounding would reduce it to 50%.
