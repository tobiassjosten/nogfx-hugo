Issue #96338   Reported by: Nearyku    Re: Alitis

I  normally wouldn't issue someone for something like this, but Alitis' player has been biased towards NEaryku for a long time. I've tried many times with civility to come to terms with his hatrwed of Near and make things work since they've been citymates for IRL years, but he just repeats the same thing. Alitis tells you, "((You zerged a non-com )). Santhaea was killed by Nearyku, Xaarin, and Menoch, trying to "bait" other MAgickers to come out since they were hiding in the cities/councils and Santhaea is a leader of Khandava. They both agreed to kill her, so she was slain. Alitis then ordered NEaryku to stand still and let himself be cleaved. He did as ordered, returned from dis. Was citydisfavoured for it right after he died, and was then order to let himself be slain at the springs as many times as Alitis wished until he was happy. This is 3 different punishments that would take a week, maybe two or more to recover from and get back to where I was. This alone is extreme prejudice on his part, many others in the city agreed but no one with any power is willing to contest the decision. Alitis then ousted NEaryku from Stavenn, where he's been a citizen for decades and served with everything he has. He then enemied Nearyku to Kragge, Stavenn, AND the Diavlous for some reason, probably just abusing his power and the whole situation, like he always does to me. I've put up with this crap for a long time, and I'm tired of it. The fact that people can just blow things up and throw anyone out that they wish, slay them, disfavour them, then announce on the Market channel that Nearyku is no longer a stavennite and cannot enter their siege lines for protection? That's ludicrous. I do not have any other Characters I play and Nearyku does not have enough lessons to do anything else, anywhere. He doesn't even have enough lessons from forgetting his Demonic professions to trans one skill. This just ruined my entire point in playing Imperian, a game I've loved for over 5 years now. I informed Alitis that without N

I killed Nearyku for making Stavenn look weak by attacking a relatively weak non-combatant 3 against 1. I did not slay the other members of his party because they claimed no knowledge of their target and Alitis trusts them. As for the remaining accusations: there are no rules governing disfavours or branding people enemies, and he was NOT in an election so the only rule for outcitizening was not broken. I admit to violating the rules listed in HELP MARKET in order to inform the world of Nearyku's exile and will accept whatever punishment the admin levies for that.
