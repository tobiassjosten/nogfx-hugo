Khizan follows you to the ether.
Dirt road north of a forest. (road). (Vardarian Highlands.?)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A large chunk of a metallic rock is lying on the ground. A sonic portal, edges vibrating madly, is here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Maglust, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a bladed whip in his left hand. Lillabee Aslyana is here, shrouded. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a sturdy shortsword in her right. The undead form of Lord Menoch Andarial, Animus Volatilis is here. He is holding a tower shield in his right hand. The undead form of Lord Alitis Valstivar, Harbinger of Catastrophe is here. Lord Oburi Nessaja, Will of Vis'Ahl is riding on a tranquil white mare. Jasmina Askare is here.
You see exits leading east, southwest, and west.

Faster than the eye can follow, Menoch's Ouroboros's blood-red hands shoot out and burrow into the chest of Dias, whose body begins bucking and convulsing from the pain. Peeling back its lips to reveal its maw, the Ouroboros roars in triumph and rips its powerful arms backwards, dragging an ephemeral, spiderweb substance with it: Dias's soul.
A worm loses its grip on Dias and drops to the ground.
A green slime loses its grip on Dias and drops to the ground.
The bloodleech loses its grip on Dias and drops to the ground.
A stream of primal darkness flows out from Dias.
Dias has been slain by Menoch.
You gasp with the realization that Menoch has reached the pk level of Paramortal.

Exposed rock. (Demon's Pass.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A fairly large pile of golden sovereigns twinkles and gleams. There are 2 corpses of a tall, sneering demon here. Skin flayed and crisped by fire, a demon lies here with a snarl twisting his dead features. A runed femur lying next to his deformed leg, a dead demon is here. A lame demon stands here leaning heavily on the long femur that serves him as a cane. A demon with a green face stands here, staring at the nearby demons with an envious expression. Veiled in thin, translucent cloth, a demonic temptress stands here with a sensual expression.
You see exits leading north and southeast.

He is a fast Sylayan. He is of an unusual appearance to those of his race. This elf stands at a tall height of six feet and one inch. The first thing that catches the eye is his long crimson hair, streaked with black wisp throughout it. Although his hair is long, it's surrounded in a flexible white clasp that drapes all the way down to his hips. His bangs fall upon his face, draping angularly across as to not block his eyes. His face although being flawless holds a very angular look. His ears add to the angularity of his elfen heritage by strike out of his hair, pointed tips at the top of each. His cheek bones rise high into his bone structure while his nose is bridged evenly within his face and with a smooth ending. His eyes seem to be liquid amethyst through his silver glasses, capturing you within their steady gaze. His eyes are equally placed upon his face and angular to his bone structure, giving him a almost feral appearance. His skin is a seemingly soft white alabaster. However, a large marring on his body can be seen upon his chest through the opening of his clothes. A large scar ravages from the left of his shoulder down to his top right rib. His torso is complimented with a muscular chest and abdomen, visible slightly through his tunic. His body although mostly thin is not without muscle. His lithe muscles place along his body giving more of an intimidating figure, yet his pearly smile seems to give a reassurance to others of safety. He is wearing a black forearm sheath, a soft, faded gray game kitbag, a modest pouch of black leather, a white feathered armband, a black leather falconry glove, a cavalry shield, a banded shield, a golden silk pack, a suit of wyvernhide armour, a modest black leather satchel, a money pouch, a white hooded cloak, a silver engagement ring, a pair of Orphanim Angel wings, a silver ring of meditation, a Girdle of Aesir, a shining metal surcoat of Cruxis, a set of diamond bracelets, a glittering ring of vitality, and a small charm. He wields Insidian's Bane in his left hand and a curved sabre in his right. He is surrounded by the fluctuating aura of the Boon of Change.

fiery invective (9:27:24 PM): it's a fairly simple logical progression
Serge335544 (9:27:27 PM): I said good job on the giant teaming, I didn't really care. Death moves like .05% of my EXP
Serge335544 (9:27:43 PM): The second one you did because you think you can do anything and get away with it type of shit
Serge335544 (9:27:46 PM): That's why it pissed me off
fiery invective (9:27:58 PM): anything? hardly
Serge335544 (9:27:59 PM): Then you further went to be a jackass and spluge shit to people I have a particular distaste for
fiery invective (9:28:05 PM): that? yes, yes i knew i could get away with that
Serge335544 (9:28:39 PM): So, I applaud your douchebaggery. Good job.
fiery invective (9:28:57 PM): thank you, thank you, i'll be here all week
Serge335544 (9:29:28 PM): I'm sure you will. Just know, it's people like you that cause some one who has a stressful life to do idiotic things because they don't get that time to be able to work down their system after some thing traumatic.
Serge335544 (9:30:25 PM): Like, oh... Say having to grab your fellow soldiers two feet that just got blown off by an IED while putting a tourniquet on his thighs to stop arterial and veinous bleedinlg while you tell him, "Don't worry, you're going to make it thoruhg" knowing that the shrapnel in his heart is causing him to bleed out.
Serge335544 (9:30:41 PM): God forbid that person try and wind down
Serge335544 (9:30:43 PM): Right?
Serge335544 (9:30:47 PM): Yeah, I guess that's right
fiery invective (9:30:48 PM): that
fiery invective (9:30:52 PM): was the worst analogy i've ever heard
fiery invective (9:30:54 PM): and you should feel ashamed
Serge335544 (9:31:08 PM): Analogy? That's what happend on Thursday.
Serge335544 (9:31:18 PM): But whatever
Serge335544 (9:31:20 PM): Go tell that to your buddies
fiery invective (9:31:22 PM): no, analogy, because you're comparing it to YOU DYING ON THE INTERNET
Serge335544 (9:31:25 PM): I'm sure I'll hear about it in the morning
fiery invective (9:31:28 PM): probably
Serge335544 (9:31:39 PM): I don't think I compared to that game at all
Serge335544 (9:32:26 PM): I believed I compared your douchbaggery of a person causing people who do activies that release stress from them causing them to be more stressed and thus, do stupid things
Serge335544 (9:32:31 PM): Was a general expression
fiery invective (9:32:46 PM): and then you tried to compare it to.. honestly
fiery invective (9:32:49 PM): why am i even trying to reason here
fiery invective (9:33:06 PM): when you're back in reality you know where to find me, i'm too lazy to hold grudges
Serge335544 (9:33:11 PM): I compared it to my stress, first hand example.
Serge335544 (9:34:00 PM): Whatever, this just gives me an extra hour to write the letter to his wife and child.
Serge335544 (9:34:12 PM): Maybe think about your actions for once and if they were wrong, then you'll see what I am talking about
Serge335544 (9:34:16 PM): Good bye.
