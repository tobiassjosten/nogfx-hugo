(Brofist): You say, "Sanai."

(Brofist): You say, "Who's your alt?"

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Guess, it's not hard."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "I'm a dick. :(."

(Brofist): You say, "Well, that can be a number of people."

(Brofist): Trez says, "^."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "I'm a high class of dick okay."

You continue implanting the totem to the land, calling on your runelore to bind
them together.

(Brofist): You say, "Now that is rare."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "The dick eternal."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "A metaphorical legend of dickery."

(Brofist): You say, "Idk, the only person that I'd know that'd make an alt is victor."

(Brofist): You say, "Though, he would make fun of my idea :(."

(Brofist): You say, "Wouldn't."

(Brofist): You say, "I don't think."

(Brofist): Khizan says, "He wouldn't."

(Brofist): Khizan says, "Victor's not good enough to know how terrible the plan really is."

(Brofist): You say, ":(."

(Brofist): You say, "Heh, wish I could rush guards."

(Brofist): You say, "God, I got finals to do."

(Brofist): Hivarius says, "What I missed."

(Brofist): You say, "Oh, my personal war against ithaqua."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Kyrock's genius plan to camp outside Ithaqua with totems until someone who isn't paying attention blunders into it."

(Brofist): Hivarius says, "Why you at war with Ithaqua again?"

(Brofist): Trez says, "You don't forest enemy people for no reason."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "For no reason?"

(Brofist): You say, "I was running into their council :P."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Dude was trying to wage a one-man war with vortex and suiciding into siege."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "I'd forest enemy him until he finally got bored and went home too."

(Brofist): Trez says, "That's a reason to enemy, not forest enemy."

....some exchange of profanity and then...

(Brofist): Sanai says, "No, raiding is not a single Lorekeeper swarming into my siege repeatedly."

(Brofist): Trez says, "Raiding is draining siege."

(Brofist): Trez says, "Numbers don't matter."

(Brofist): You say, "I got all the rocks drained."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "No, Raiding is actually invading a place."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Being a siege-draining faggot is not 'raiding'."

(Brofist): Trez says, "Step 1 of which is draining siege."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Have you ever actually, like, raided? If you're relying on sitting in siege for hours to start a raid, you are bad."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "I mean jesus christ."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "YOU KNOW BETTER."

(Brofist): Trez says, "I have blackwind."

(Brofist): Trez says, "Kyrock doesn't."

(Brofist): You say, "I don't have a way in."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "If he wanted to raid, he could like."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Get a mage and a renegade."

(Brofist): You say, "Who?"

(Brofist): Sanai says, "I dunno, nobody around? Guess you aren't raiding then."

(Brofist): You say, "Or."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Solo ganking is not raiding no matter how much you profess it to be, guys."

(Brofist): Aedius says, "And forest enemying is faggotry no matter the circumstance, no matter what you profess."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "I've never had to drain siege to raid."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "And I wiped out my fair share of orgs."

(Brofist): Trez says, "You never raided alone."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Because going in alone isn't raiding bro."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "It's solo ganking."

(Brofist): Trez says, "They serve the same purpose."

(Brofist): Trez says, "Essentially equivalent."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "One serves the purpose of killing a couple dudes before you get chased out, the other generally serves the purpose of killing a lot of dudes and some guards and fucking up siege lines and generally making life hell for them."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "It's an invasion attempt, not a roaming PK gang."

(Brofist): You say, "I plan on doing damage."


(Brofist): Aedius says, "Lol."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "You're certainly not doing damage sitting in the Bardosi with your pain/transfix totems."

(Brofist): Trez says, "You can't kill guards now that they have 1337 versions."

(Brofist): Aedius says, "Kyrock, that's probably not going to happen. :(."

(Brofist): You say, "I'm not sitting."

(Brofist): Trez says, "Fucking up siege lines requires draining siege first."

(Brofist): You say, "And I'm paving the way."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Paving the way with what, your own corpses?"

(Brofist): You say, "Sure."

(Brofist): Aedius says, "Ithaqua as a whole allowing one person to abuse forest defenses, to any extent, is lame."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "That's not abuse."

(Brofist): Sanai says, "Especially because Ithaqua's don't hit you outside of (guess what) Ithaqua."

(Brofist): Trez says, "I don't really have a problem with Ithaqua's forest defs if Antioch gets desert defs, Kinsarmar gets Vardarian defs and Stavenn gets Ravana defs."

Brofist): Trez says, "Kyrock wouldn't have pain totemed their whole forest if he wasn't forest enemied."

(Brofist): Ashel says, "(S-A-C): Ozreas says, "Forget this, Ithaqua can keep not defending their forest by themselves. I'm going back to sleep."."

(Brofist): Ashel says, "Kyrock's nerd rage is infectious."

(Brofist): Ashel says, "If I battle him, will I too succumb? :(."

and many hours and nets and 7 implanted totems later we have:


You slash viciously into an elite Idrasi wolfrider with a curved sabre.
The final blow proves too much for an elite Idrasi wolfrider, who expires, 
pitifully.
You have slain an elite Idrasi wolfrider.
A large pile of sovereigns spills from the corpse.

What do we have to learn from all this? Don't doubt K-Rock because he's more then just one LK running into siege.
