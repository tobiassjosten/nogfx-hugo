Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a 
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil 
lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A 
well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan 
Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a 
goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite 
sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an 
ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean 
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble 
foam about its mouth. A small sign points into a market stall. Tomast the 
Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. Sergeant Islene is here, 
shrouded. She wields a curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her 
right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. The once grand market square of ancient Caanae surrounds this 
centralized point, where the ground has been shaken and torn apart by a 
catastrophic event. Three meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic 
scripts lie collapsed upon the ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean
askew to one side of the stone pile, blocking the view from outside of all the 
wonders housed within this temple. Barely standing under the weight of a pillar
is a marble altar, which has been etched with scars and scratches from the 
passage of time and elements. The structure of the pillars silently displays 
how it was once a small but impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar 
indicate it to have been built in honor of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the 
cracks in the centre is a passage of pure water, perhaps the purest known in 
the realm of Aetherius. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the 
ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant 
river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A 
small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft 
light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a 
Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera,
a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble
rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop

a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. A tengu hovers 
gently over the ground here. Sergeant Islene is here, shrouded. She wields a 
curved sabre in her left hand and a tower shield in her right.
