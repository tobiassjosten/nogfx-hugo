She is an athletic Lamira. She is standing at about 5 feet 8 inches. Her skin is light blue in color, upon closer inspection you notice that she has webbing between her fingers and gills upon her neck. Her eyes are grey in color and are fliting about the room never settling on something for too long. Her hair is black and falls down to around her shoulders. She is wearing a sapphire stud tongue ring, a golden silk pack, 2 low-slung hematite scabbards, a pair of leather greaves, a feathered black velvet cloak, a soft jade gossamer sari, a leather helm, a suit of scale mail, and a pair of leather vambraces. She wields a strong broadsword in each hand.
