Within a fiery crater. (Yhumara Lake.)
A pillar of flame stretches towards the heavens here, bathing the area in a 
crimson glow. A captivating, wrought-iron display case sits here, decorated 
with an assortment of horseshoes, bone beads and feathers. A glittering ruby 
stone has been left here, the image of a burning sun carved into it. There are 
7 corpses of a giant tarantula here. A sleek ivory hound paces here, panting 
incessently. With a wild look in his eye, a feral paint stallion stands 
heatedly here as he stomps and paces recklessly. The undead form of Mord'ssur 
Lidoss Nearyku Il'andor is here. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and 
a tower shield in his right.
You see a single exit leading out.
<383/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> (Done.) 
(Antioch): Linelle says, "Farewell."
<383/386h 293/293m 1813e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku raises an eyebrow at you.
<383/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku whips a curved sabre through the air in front of you, to no effect.
<383/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku moves in to engage you.
<383/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> take nearyku hostage

You slowly make your away around behind Nearyku, far enough away to remain 
inconspicuous.
Balance Taken: 4.00s
<383/386h 293/293m 1808e 1365w <e-> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Mord'ssur Lidoss Nearyku Il'andor says, "Why are you here."
<383/386h 293/293m 1809e 1365w <e-> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
(Antioch): Maksim says, "Be well, Linelle."
<383/386h 293/293m 1809e 1365w <e-> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku belches forth a cloud of stinking gas into your surroundings. You 
cannot help but inhale it and immediately vomit everywhere.
<383/386h 293/293m 1809e 1365w <e-> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
You have recovered balance.
<383/386h 293/293m 1809e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
(Antioch): Guardas says, "Be well Linelle."
<383/386h 293/293m 1809e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Mord'ssur Lidoss Nearyku Il'andor says, "This is my home."
<383/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
As you approach Nearyku's back, you quietly draw your knife to the ready, 
holding it low and out of sight.
<383/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
(Antioch): Anatolia says, "Rest well, Linelle."
<383/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
(Antioch): Diaktoros says, "Be well."
<383/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku flings an arm into the air, and the light around you is suddenly 
swamped in pitch darkness.
<383/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku takes a drink from a black pearl-shaped vial.
<383/386h 293/293m 1810e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
With one last, silent step, you find yourself directly behind Nearyku and 
prepare yourself for the pounce.
<383/386h 293/293m 1811e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku raises an eyebrow at you.
<383/386h 293/293m 1811e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku barks at a sleek ivory hound, ordering it to attack you.
<383/386h 293/293m 1811e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku moves in to engage you.
<383/386h 293/293m 1811e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
You feel your density return to normal. (density)
<383/386h 293/293m 1811e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
A flick of the wrist, a flash of your blade, and you take Nearyku hostage with 
your knife to his throat.
<383/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Mord'ssur Lidoss Nearyku Il'andor says, "Fool boy."
<383/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Nearyku struggles against you, and you compensate by pressing your knife more 
firmly against his throat.
<383/386h 293/293m 1812e 1365w <eb> <p> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> execute hostage

You swiftly drag the edge of your knife across Nearyku's throat, splitting 
flesh and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to flow from the 
horrible wound in his neck as he topples to the ground, turning around to give 
you a look of despair as the light slowly fades from his eyes.
You have slain Nearyku.
