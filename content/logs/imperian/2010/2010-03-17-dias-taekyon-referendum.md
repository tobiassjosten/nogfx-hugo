Subj: Referendum & Manoa

Manoa,

We have all seen the results of the Referendum pending my presence within the guild. Regardless of the results it was my intention to quit the guild. So, I would like to explain why I may have had this reasoning in my actions.

Manoa, as Fallon had posted prior to me, this is ridiculous to ridicule one 
member but not others. Yes, I have had a Magick profession. Yes, I have slain Antiochians and Ithaquans. I have done my time, I have paid my fines, and I have amended my wrongs. However, none of you see past the shield of rumors and words from others. Not once have I been approached by a Monoan and asked, "Dias, are the things they say true about you? Can you explain why you did the things you did?"

My intentions were pure with this guild, joining to improve myself and provide a hand in whatever I would be able to. Whether it be crafting to combat advice, I was prepared to do. It leaves me with a heavy heart to say this Manoa, before you judge another perhaps you should look in the mirror and stare at yourself. Generally the beast criticized is one that dwells within yourself.

With that, I give you my leave and the word to Diaktoros, I am leaving the 
guild. May Lord Baar's blessings shower upon you all, and may others who join with a less than fortunate past have a better chance at this guild than I.

Sir Dias Tethe'alla

P.S. - I find it ironic that the vote for my referendum was led by three prior magickers who were long in service of the Magick Circle than I. If I am to be condemned for my past, perhaps you should condemn yourselves, no?
