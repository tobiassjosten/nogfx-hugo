Flourishing woodland. (Southeastern Arena.)
Chattering animals and whistling birds make this seem more like the middle of 
the Celidon forest than the ruins of an ancient arena. The forest has truly 
come in to entirely reclaim this area. Tall trees stand here, vines connecting 
them, while flowers and other fauna thrive on the ground. There is a small 
group of charcoal cinders here. A silver couatl is coiled here. Hovering in the
air is a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. An 
icewall is here, blocking passage to the down. Its head poised in a prideful 
stance, a sleek black stallion stands here snorting arrogantly. A nearly 
perfect sketch of a female drelith floats in midair here.
