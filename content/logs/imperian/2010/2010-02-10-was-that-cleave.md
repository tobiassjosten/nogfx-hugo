The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an 
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken 
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is

small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another 
path in the southeast of this chamber.

Dashiki drops to the floor and sweeps his legs round at you.

Markie viciously slashes you with a broadsword of Vahin!
Your steelweave surcoat completely absorbs the damage.
You shudder as you feel your life essence being sucked away by a broadsword of 
Vahin.
You begin sweating heavily, your skin heating to unnatural temperatures. [slowsalves]

Markie rakes the jagged edge of a lunar shield at you.
You shudder as you feel your life essence being sucked away by a lunar shield.
You watch with your mouth gaping in horror as your left arm shrivels up and [broken left arm] 
becomes useless.

Dashiki takes a long drag off his pipe, exhaling a thick, white haze.

Collapsed wall. (Southwestern Arena.)
Part of the wall surrounding the arena stood the test of time fairly well, 
forming the frame of this room as it leans against harder rock. Triangularly 
shaped, the hard surface of the wall has long been covered with moss, but here 
there the mortar lines of the original construction can be seen.
You see exits leading southeast and northwest.
You drop back and ease the engagement.

Rock covered cave. (Southwestern Arena.)
The entire collapse of the southwestern section of the arena has created an 
intricate network of caves and small tunnels. The path up above you has broken 
down further in the years after the collapse of the area, and this cave is 
littered with broken remnants of the road. A faint dripping emanates from a 
small tunnel that exits to the east, and a break in the rubble shows another 
path in the southeast of this chamber.
You see exits leading east, southeast, and up.

You are already standing.

Your aura of weapons rebounding disappears. [rebounding]
You raise a curved sabre over your head and begin to swing it in a wide circle,
gaining speed as you go.

< 314/391h 322/343m 1553w > [eb][db]  - P -
Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, you bring your sabre crashing straight
down on Markie's head. With a power that seems to come from on high, you cleave
asunder his entire body, from head to groin, splitting him in two and killing 
him instantly.
You have slain Markie.


Markie tells you, "Was that cleave!"
