(Kinsarmar): Galt says, "Bards. I never liked them, never will. The guild has historically been problematic, and I've stood by my conviction that the Duchy doesn't need them since I first became Kinsmarian."
Alvetta tells you, "Who is that ass?"

(Kinsarmar): You say, "Well Galt, since the bard guild has been defending, in greater numbers and amount of times then the Lorekeepers, perhaps you should change your stance."
You tell Shadow Maiden Alvetta Eldris, "A cranky old man who should just stay sleeping."
You spit on the ground in disgust.
You say, "I really, hate Galt."
(Kinsarmar): Galt says, "No, you're all still morons in tights, and I'll retain that view until disproved. There are some exceptions, but they're rare."
(Kinsarmar): Roran says, "Is there some point to this conversation or are you just trying to piss people off?"
You tell Roran, "That is what Galt does, he wakes up, be an ass, and then sleeps again."
You exclaim to Axyom, "So tempted...to be bad...and kill Galt...must resist!!"
Acorn Queen, Axyom Noyreshe says, "It's what he wants, isn't it? Don't let him win."
(Kinsarmar): Galt says, "I don't really know anymore. I just don't like the bards and I'm feeling crochety and peckish."
(Kinsarmar): You say, "I've seen the youngest member of my guild do more for the Duchy lately Galt then you have. So unless you want to prove me wrong, please keep such opinions private."
You say, "There, polite yet not taking shit from him."
You nod sagely.
(Kinsarmar): Galt says, "Applying irellevant caveats and conditions to statements renders them rather pointless. Whilst a young bard may have done more than I have lately, I'm approaching my second century, so they still have 
quite some catching up to do."
You say to Axyom, "Just being great in the past doesn't shouldn't give you a free ride for the rest of your life...and don't worry, I'm not going to do anything to get me into trouble with him.
