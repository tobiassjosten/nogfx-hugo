You follow Zerin to the ether. (ether)
Along the West circle, near the residential wall. (City of Kinsarmar.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. 
Walking along the street, you can't help but notice the towers towering on 
either side. A road of smooth marble seems to be well traveled, by citizen and 
guard alike noticeable by the slight flaws in the otherwise perfect marble. The
road is artificially lit by Mages where subtle stones glow a faint yellow, 
creating an artificial light even in the darkest of hours. The massive wall 
here appears more than defensible, yet it is not the Curam'Nathariel, instead 
they appear to be of a higher quality, more artistic stonework here. The walls 
of the residential section seem to meet with those of the Curam'Nathariel, 
completely encompassing the area from outside influences. The walls appear 
carved with a massive bas-relief design, intricately looping and repeating to 
make a simply breath-taking and artistic sense to the rather otherwise 
militaristic edifice of the city. There are 2 eye sigils here. A sigil in the 
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. General Dias 
Tethe'alla, Archmagus of Fire is here, surrounded by a aura of black flames. He
wields Sabre of the Magi in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading north and south.
