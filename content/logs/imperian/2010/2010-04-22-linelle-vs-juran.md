Linelle's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.  <-  Linelle'S REBOUNDING IS GONE.     
Linelle'S REBOUNDING IS GONE    Linelle'S REBOUNDING IS GONE    Linelle'S REBOUNDING IS GONE

Panic overcomes you as Linelle draws back her bowstring and releases an arrow, a
thin trail of smoke left by the burning fuse as it flys toward you.
Sparks catch your eye as an arrow cuts through the air, burying itself deep in 
your flesh. Noticing the fuse which burns upon it through the blinding pain, you
are almost overcome with panic.

Linelle takes a long drag off her pipe, exhaling a thick, white haze.
H:349 M:575 E:1718 W:2397 <eb p> 21:24:00.733 04/21
The fuse on the arrow buried in your gut begins to burn low, your sense of alarm
building.

You say, "KABOOM."

Your wounds cause you to bleed 6 health.

You suddenly perceive the vague outline of an aura of rebounding around Linelle.  <-   HAS PUT UP REBOUNDING - DON'T ATTACK.
REBOUNDING - DON'T ATTACK     REBOUNDING - DON'T ATTACK     REBOUNDING - DON'T ATTACK

The fuse on the arrow buried in your gut begins to burn low, your sense of alarm
building.

The arrow's fuse disappears within the black packet tied to the shaft, and all 
is quiet for a moment. You don't even have time to witness your life flashing 
before your eyes as the packet explodes violently, white fire the last thing you
see as your body is blown to nothing more than charred bone and vaporized flesh.
You have been slain by Linelle. (all)
You are OUT of the Free-For-All!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
There are 2 beehives here. A group of charcoal cinders lies here in a pile. 
Majestic in both appearance and bearing, a giant panda stands here, warily 
sniffing at her surroundings. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular 
monolith is on the ground. There are 9 charred and jagged skullcaps here. There 
are 9 mutilated legs here. There are 7 severed ears here. There are 7 gnarled 
fingers here. Lying at your feet is a bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and 
throbbing with life. There are 2 mortal hearts here. There are 23 corpses of a 
swarm of bees here. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here.
You see a single exit leading down.
H:418 M:575 E:1718 W:2398 <eb>  (+75)21:24:10.796 04/21
You see a bright light shine on you as all your afflictions are cured. (all)
