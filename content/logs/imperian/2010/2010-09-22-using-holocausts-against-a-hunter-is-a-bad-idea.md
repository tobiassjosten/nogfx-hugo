A small brown lemming scurries around Hiramius furiously, stripping his 
blindness defence.
You quickly eat a toadstool. (anorexia)
The toadstool slides down without effect.

The sky above grows dark as Hiramius calls upon powerful magicks. Raising his 
hands balefully, he causes lightning bolts, the hammer of the storm, to shoot 
from his hands and slam into you.
A surge of rejuvenating energy floods your system, healing your wounds. (vitality)
[[(SYSTEM]]: VITALITY IS DOWN!

You inhale deeply, allowing the raging flames to build up inside you. With an 
earth-shaking roar, you release a white-hot jet of fire directly at Hiramius.
With an instinctive gesture of self-preservation, Hiramius raises his arms 
ahead of himself in terror as the jet of white-hot fire shoots towards him 
through the air. The gesture is futile, as the column of flame incinerates poor
Hiramius instantly. For a second his charred skeleton stands transfixed before 
you, then crumbles to ashes.
You have slain Hiramius.
[[(SYSTEM]]: Hiramius owned. Change target if necessary!
Hiramius, Aspect of Aryana leaves to the ether, a feeling of peace leaving with
him.
