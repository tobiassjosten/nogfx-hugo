Atop a precarious cliff. (road).
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The violent crashing of waves is 
rather deafening as this makeshift path extends to the north and southeast along
the rocky cliff. Though the height of the cliff seems to dwindle off a great 
deal to the north, this particular spot is a solid fifteen metres above the 
turbulent ocean, with constant winds whistling around you. Something of a 
reprieve is visible to the east, where a crack in the rock is just wide enough 
to allow entry. A swirling vortex floats here. 
You see exits leading north, east, and southeast.
