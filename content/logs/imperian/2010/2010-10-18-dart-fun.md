--- Aryana's Spring ------- 0:0:0 ---
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Gore is splattered 
about, a display of Dias's cruel handiwork. The spring of crystalline water 
gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a 
shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of 
inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the 
floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite 
stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A 
painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the 
surrounding area. A small sign points into a market stall. A shattered statue 
of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the 
throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses 
here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base 
filled with offerings. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving
in the wind. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of
the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and 
striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here
depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin 
stands here, marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his
surroundings. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth
stands here with confidence and aloofness. Rais Awwal Sadie Wyrdim is here. She
wields a curved sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
