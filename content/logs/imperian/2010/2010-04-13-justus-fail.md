Justus's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
Justus calls upon the Protector and gives a grave nod to his Seraph, whose 
wings flare suddenly as an alien and frightening look of power sweeps across 
her face. With one hand, the Seraph reaches forward, and as her hand touches 
your chest, it flares an impossibly bright white, and enters your breast. The 
Seraph's eyes roll back in its head and as your soul is torn screaming from 
your body, you collapse to the ground in neverending, inhuman pain.
You have been slain by Justus. (all)

That's my favorite part. Absolved with over half mana.
