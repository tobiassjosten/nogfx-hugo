This is after Rin attacks Ugralitan while Ugralitan is gathering herbs or some crap. Rin gets 8 fashions off before Ugralitan hides inside one of Ithaqua's townes and lays traps and walls. Ugralitan then runs back to antioch shuk to hide. Rin tells him to stop being a coward and so Ugralitan says to come to him. Rin won't walk blindly into a trap so Ugralitan says he is walking the globe to prove he isn't in a trap when in fact he is standing in the Yhumara Islands that are filled with traps of his. (Oh and Ugralitan don't worry I left out the part where you said that you would quit out if you thought I was going to win.)

Ugralitan tells you, "I could kill my 300 percent mightier people, but wytchen case is different."
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "And saying that you are trotting the 
globe for me while wandering the Yhumara Islands is a straight up lie."
Ugralitan tells you, "Alright I'll go another parts if you wish *chuckle*."
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "Amazing. You are still a lying coward."
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "You are really pathetic."
(I lost the part where he called me pathetic)
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "How so?"
Ugralitan tells you, "Attacking peaceful people is pathetic."
Ugralitan tells you, "While harvesting I even asked are you looking for something or not."
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "Peaceful people don't have 51 kills."
Ugralitan tells you, "I'm peaceful right now."
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "Oh right. So you shouldn't be attacked when you don't want to."
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "Come fight me coward."
Ugralitan tells you, "I wish you had some honor after all, bringing old feuds, how pathetic of you."
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "Cry much?"
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "Wipe your tears away and at the very least stop acting like such a coward."
You tell Magister Lord Ugralitan Iavas, "Stop running."

You laugh darkly and squint at Ugralitan as you add some final touches to your 
doll of him.
The vodun doll's eyes fly open, and its arms and legs begin to slowly move.
The doll has now been fashioned 10 times.

Ugralitan inhales deeply, then lets out an earth-shaking roar as a jet of 
white-hot fire shoots from his nostrils directly at you.
A great long-nosed armadillo loses its grip and drops to the ground.
A thorny lizard loses its grip and drops to the ground.
You flinch and raise your arms in front of your face in an instinctive gesture 
of terror, but the effort is futile. The heat and intensity of the flames are 
too much for your weakened frame to stand, and the last thing you see through 
your charred eyes is a glimpse of the pure, white-hot fire consuming your 
entire body.
You have been slain by Ugralitan.
