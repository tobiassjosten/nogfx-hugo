Frozen by fear, you can do naught but watch, wide-eyed with terror, as the 
blazing sphere streaks towards you and slams into your body, burning you 
horribly.
With mounting horror, you realize that the meteorite is heading straight for 
your location.

Trez's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
You watch in horror, helpess, as Trez's fist is wreathed in crackling black 
energy. With a diabolical laugh, he stiffens his hand and slowly runs it down 
your chest, splitting it open as he does so. Though you scream in pain and beg 
to die, Trez proceeds to rip apart your organs, magnifying the pain until you 
are driven nearly mad. With a detached smile upon his face, he proceeds to rip 
out your sternum and drive it through your already splayed-out body, pinning it 
to the ground and finally killing you.
You have been slain by Trez. (all)
