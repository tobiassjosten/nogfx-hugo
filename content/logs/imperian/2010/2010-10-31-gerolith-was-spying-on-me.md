The Nexus. (lost)
A small cavern has been dug out of the rough stone wall here. Shambles of 
debris from construction cover the floor and litter the handy shelves dug out 
from the sides of the cavern. The floors, walls and ceiling are still rough 
from the chiseled fashion in which the room has been constructed. Roughly hewn 
logs form a crude doorway empty of an actual door. A sigil in the shape of a 
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Holding a tankard of ale aloft, 
Gerolith, God of Might stands here. You see a sign here instructing you that 
WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading south and down (closed door).

You tell Shadow Maiden Alvetta Mjollnir, "But he HEARD."
  
Alvetta tells you, "He heard about XXXX , too!!??"

You tell Shadow Maiden Alvetta Mjollnir, "All of it.
  
Alvetta tells you, "He heard you say COCKK."

You blush furiously.

You tell Shadow Maiden Alvetta Mjollnir, "NOES!"
  
Alvetta tells you, "Ugh."
