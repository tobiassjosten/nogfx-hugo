A group of whimsical air elementals whiz through the skies, spinning and 
whirling erratically. The air elementals begin pulling at your arms and you 
slowly begin to rise up into the air.
Aleutia, Anyra, Arian, Avi, Eludien, Genviere, Ivellios, Ranai, and Sanai 
follow you to the ether.

An air elemental, larger than the others, drifts down and floats just before 
you. With a gentle slow, the elemental in front of you begins to drift in front
of your form, scrutinizing you. You feel as if your very soul is being touched 
by its probing gaze.

The air elemental appears to appears to gain some structure to its form,

about her face in layers. Her pointed ears part the inky locks, which have been
woven through with feathered, russet ribbons. A gentle demeanor pervades about

delicate iris, a Hunter's cloak, 26 pocketbelts, a cuff bracelet set with 
turquoise, a tinkling glass bluebell anklet, a sanguine ruby wedding band, a 
wispy pale silver gossamer choker, a filigree black pearl necklace, an elegant
