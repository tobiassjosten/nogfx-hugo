Your senses flare as a luminous green image drifts in from the south, its 
appearance sharpening to reveal Shou.

Your action causes the shimmering translucent shield around you to fade away.
A pathfinder demon entity concentrates for a moment. Suddenly your surroundings
blur, and when vision returns to normal, you recognise that you have travelled 
far quicker than the capacity of any mortal.
Imperial Parade nearing the gates of Stavenn.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A generator plinth has
been built here, energy crackling around its edges. There are 3 monolith sigils
here. The mighty war gong of Stavenn looms here, hanging between two pillars of
fused bone. The visage of a horrific demon carved in bloodstone rises up from a
base of skulls and stone. A bubbling noise can be heard coming from the dark 
liquid of the fountain that has been placed here, as the occasional 
heart-shaped cherry bobs along the flowing fluid. A slow oozing of blood runs 
the length of this black cross. An elite elegantly dressed Noctusari is manning
a cannon here. She has eighty cannon balls. There are 2 roan mustangs here. 
Smoky tendrils constantly twisting and weaving around a towering demon statue, 
a shadow servant is here. A kohdon scout stands here eyeing his surroundings 
with an impassionated stare. Anointed with blood, a heinous demonic jackal 
crouches here baring gleaming teeth. A black wolf stalks silently here, 
sniffing the air for prey. A white-furred animal has been slain nearby, its 
soft coat splattered with thick globs of blood. It is a desert fox, for once 
out-witted. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. A sleek black hound 
stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Kappa stands here covered in filth, 
a brand new longbow in hand. Eous is here, a blank look in his eyes. He wields 
a strong broadsword in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading east, southeast, west, and northwest.
As a pathfinder's energy depletes, it returns to the Demonic Plane.
