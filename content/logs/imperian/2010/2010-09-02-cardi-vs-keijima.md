The edges of the Modin valley. (road). (Modin Valley.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. With the rugged and somber colors of the Nolmine mountains straining 
skywards not far to the north, this northern edge of the Modin seems fairly 
insignificant in comparison, until you see the vibrant growth they support. 
While the mountains are magnificent and stark, the valley celebrates life and 
growth, and the power of living things. Both are wonders of the Gods' creation 
and each in its sphere fulfills the purpose for which it was created. The 
shrunken head of Hivarius has been staked into the ground here, the last 
torments of life still visible upon his face. A fierce sabretooth tiger prowls 
silently here. The ever-shifting visage of Keijima, Aspect of Moradeim, is here.
He is rapidly swinging a sword above his head.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

A roar of triumph bursts from Keijima and with horrified realization, you watch 
as he brings his whirling sabre towards your neck, severing your head from your 
body. The last thing you see before death is your own crumpling body, neck 
spitting blood like a fountain.
You have been slain by Keijima. (all)

Your consciousness shifts, and you feel your body no more.

You feel a moment of disorientation, followed by a sensation of floating upward 
as if you had no weight.

Keijima tells you, "I did warn you."
