2010/10/27 02:57:06 - Simias declared Dias to be a formal enemy. Reason: 
Multiple murders of Abhaen and Antiochians.
2010/10/27 03:13:48 - Simias > Dias is a formal enemy of the Abhaen. As such, 
he has threatened the life of every Guildmember. I for one am tired of his 
constant attacks on the City and Guildmates. To this, I have set myself against
him. I may not win, but by the Gods...I\'ll get a few licks in! He needs to die 
repeatedly. I am going to speak with the Ruling Council and if Dias wants to 
kill Antiochians without reserve...I am going to propose that we take the fight
to all Kinsarmarians until Dias relents or they oust him from the City.
2010/10/27 04:11:25 - Simias > From this moment on, unrestricted killing of the
following individuals may commence Renac, Menoch, Ivellios, Iceselist and Dias.
For each head of those mentioned, I will give 5 credits except for Dias who\'s 
head will garner 10 credits. I will make these payments until I order the 
killing to cease. In the words of the Shah, \"Where ever they may be, any time 
of day or night, show them the wrong of what they\'ve done. I would request any 
not on the list be left alone at this time, cut, cut your target and strike 
true, then depart, leaving only confusion in your wake.\" Swift Blades and 
Silent Steps Abhaen.
