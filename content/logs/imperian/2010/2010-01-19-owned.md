Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin 
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of 
utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in 
ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man 
with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue 
of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the 
large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels.
A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A 
small sign points into a market stall. A shaggy grey mustang roams warily 
nearby. A massive groomed black stallion stands here proudly, its large form 
covered in silver battle armour. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast 
over the Springs. A mug of syrupy liquid sits nearby. A sleek black hound 
stands stone still, ears perked and alert. There are 2 Seraphic guardians here.
A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. Pareze is here, a blank look in 
her eyes. She is holding a tower shield in her left hand. Executor 
Vasharnashar, of the Frozen North is here. He wields an ivory sitara in his 
left hand. Justus Sunjackal is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left 
hand and a tower shield in his right. Will of Vis'Ahl Enteri Landstrider is 
here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a living vodun doll of 
Justus in his right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

The eyes on the doll in Enteri hand begin to bulge and very soon after, maggots
erupt from under the skin of the doll, consuming it utterly.
Maggots begin to burrow up from the skin of Justus, who begins to scream in 
pain.

The doll is completely consumed and Enteri drops the writhing maggots on the 
ground.
Justus's screaming is muffled as he only succeeds only in coughing up the 
maggots that are consuming him from the inside out. In seconds he is dead, and 
his body is completely eaten by the maggots.
Justus has been slain by Enteri.
