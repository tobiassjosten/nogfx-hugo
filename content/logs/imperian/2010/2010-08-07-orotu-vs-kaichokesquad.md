A steeply sloped cliff. (Ik'taru Expanse.) (11436)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The roar of the ocean and the salty smell of sea water surrounds you, as you ascend up this steep bluff. Several small barnacle encrusted rocks reside hidden amongst the small cracks and crevices along the stone wall, their forms slightly beaten and abused. Before you, you can see the once wide rock face becoming more narrow as it grows higher into the sky, before finally forming a small peak at the top. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. A torn piece of yellowed parchment lays here. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Diavlous Archknight Trez Blackmoor is here, shrouded. He wields a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. 
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.
