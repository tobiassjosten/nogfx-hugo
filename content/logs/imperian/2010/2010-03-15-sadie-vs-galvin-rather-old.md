You move in towards Galvin for the backbreaker.
You lift Galvin triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised 
knee with back breaking force.
With a sickening crunch and cry of pure agony, hedgehog's head lolls aimlessly 
far too far to one side. Hedgehog collapses into such an undignified sprawl 
that you realise that the throw did indeed snap the spine like a dry twig.
You have slain Galvin.
Defeated, Galvin is cast out of the Arena.
