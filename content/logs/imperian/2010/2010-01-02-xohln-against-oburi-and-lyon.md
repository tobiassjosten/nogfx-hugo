A bend in the highway. (road). (Modin Valley.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. The valley lowers for a short stretch here, allowing you to walk easily
for a time as the highway winds and turns. Willow trees grow thickly here, 
drawing life-giving moisture and providing a roosting place for birds, which 
cluster thickly in their branches, dipping them with their weight. Hovering in 
the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. A 
black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. A
small black cobra is flaring its hood here. A dusky flathead lies here dead. 
Some hyssop stem is discarded here. A nearly perfect sketch of a frost pixie 
floats in midair here. Lyon Zaridiux is here, shrouded. He wields a 
wicked-looking daegger in his left hand.
You see exits leading east and south.
