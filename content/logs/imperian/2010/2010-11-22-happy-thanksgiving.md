You wave the corpse of a snow owl about energetically.

You lick the corpse of a snow owl.

You gnaw intently on the corpse of a snow owl.

Blood stains the snowy white feathers of a dead owl.
It weighs about 25 pounds.
It is loyal to Mathiaus.

Skewering the corpse of a snow owl on a thin stick, you place it in the forks 
of the two sticks on the sides of the fire in the encampment. Patiently turning
the stick, you roast the meat evenly on all sides.

You hang the meat above the fire so that the smoke of the fire rises up to it 
and seasons the meat.

You put a shank of roasted meat into an elegant white letter.


You read what is written on an elegant white letter:
Dear Mathiaus,

I couldn't find a turkey, or anything else, but I did find your owl, and I 
figured it would have to do, and you wouldn't really mind.

Happy Thanksgiving!



You address the letter to Mathiaus, and immediately a harried-looking woman 
comes out to take it from you. She whistles, and a dove comes flying into the 
room. The woman attaches the letter to the dove's leg, and it speeds away.
