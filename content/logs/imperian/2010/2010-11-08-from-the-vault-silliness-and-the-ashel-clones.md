You call upon the Lord of the Dead and nod gravely at your Seraph, whose wings 
flare suddenly as an alien and frightening look of power sweeps across her 
face. With one hand, she reaches forward and as her hand touches Sanai's chest,
it flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters her breast. The Seraph's eyes
roll back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Sanai's body. Sanai 
collapses without a sound; her body now nothing more than a useless husk.
You have slain Sanai.

There are 8 chunks of bone in a group here. A charred and bloodied chunk of 
someone's head lies here, mostly just skullcap. Lying at your feet is a 
bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and throbbing with life. Smoke issues from
this mutilated leg, the skin peeled back by scorching heat. The burnt remnant 
of someone's ear lies on the ground. Busily examining the library, Mathardan 
the Loresage wanders about. There are 2 monolith sigils here. Resting on the 
ground is a fist-shaped sigil. A dark mass of coalesced shadow lies here. A 
silver ring, set with a shimmering sapphire, rests upon the ground. There are 2
amethyst encrusted silver rings here. A Fleshrender battleaxe has been left 
behind here. Left to weather the elements, a dark tower shield lies here. A 
straight-edged sabre lies here, abandoned. The elegant form of a hornbow lies 
nearby. Its gray body limp, this fish is no more. With nowhere to go, this 
yellowish perch has stopped breathing. A bream lies dead here, its dark scales 
shimmering. There are 2 spotted walleyes here. A brook trout lies here 
helpless, its life gone. The small mouth of this bass unmoving, it lies dead. 
Someone has discarded a glass jar here. There are 2 Girdle of the Titans here. 
A well-crafted quiver has been left on the floor here. There are 7 Armband of 
Celerities here. There are 4 corpses of a dark, razor-sharp oyster here. There

There are 2 toadstools in 2 groups here. The crushed translucent body of a 
bloodworm lies here in a pool of blood. The shining figure of a Seraphic 
guardian floats in the air here. This is a library. Squire Sareer Bharathian is

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Gore 
is splattered about, a display of Garryn's cruel handiwork. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass 
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small 
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The decapitated head of Alexio has
been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tossing his 
majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A
pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is 
here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. There are 2 maidenhair 
leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the 
Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. Floating in the air 
is a fiery portal. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect 
of Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a lunar shield in his 
right. He is surrounded by 189 reflections of himself. Jundi Lyon Zaridiux is 
riding on an armoured battle stallion. He wields a Souledge Sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Gore 
is splattered about, a display of Garryn's cruel handiwork. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass 
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small 
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The decapitated head of Alexio has
been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tossing his 
majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A
pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is 
here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. There are 2 maidenhair 
leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the 
Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. Floating in the air 
is a fiery portal. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air 
here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana. He
wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a lunar shield in his right. He is 
surrounded by 189 reflections of himself. Jundi Lyon Zaridiux is riding on an 
armoured battle stallion. He wields a Souledge Sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Gore 
is splattered about, a display of Garryn's cruel handiwork. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass 
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small 
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The decapitated head of Alexio has
been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tossing his 
majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A
pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is 
here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. There are 2 maidenhair 
leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the 
Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. The shining figure 
of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A peaceful aura fills the area, 
emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his left 
hand and a lunar shield in his right. He is surrounded by 189 reflections of

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Gore 
is splattered about, a display of Garryn's cruel handiwork. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass 
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small 
sign points into a market stall. A length of sturdy rope has been dropped here.
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. The decapitated head of Alexio has
been carelessly tossed aside. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. Tossing his 
majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A
pair of high-polished boots lies here. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is 
here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. There are 2 maidenhair 
leaves in 2 groups here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the 
Springs. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. The shining figure 
of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A peaceful aura fills the area, 
emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a curved sabre in his left 
hand and a lunar shield in his right. He is surrounded by 189 reflections of 
himself. Jundi Lyon Zaridiux is riding on an armoured battle stallion. He 
wields a Souledge Sabre in each hand. Menoch Andarial is here. He wields a 
curved sabre in his left hand and a lunar shield in his right.

Within the great Library of Caanae. (ruins of Caanae.)
There are 8 chunks of bone in a group here. A charred and bloodied chunk of 
someone's head lies here, mostly just skullcap. Lying at your feet is a 
bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and throbbing with life. Smoke issues from
this mutilated leg, the skin peeled back by scorching heat. The burnt remnant 
of someone's ear lies on the ground. Busily examining the library, Mathardan 
the Loresage wanders about. There are 2 monolith sigils here. Resting on the 
ground is a fist-shaped sigil. A dark mass of coalesced shadow lies here. A 
silver ring, set with a shimmering sapphire, rests upon the ground. There are 2
amethyst encrusted silver rings here. Left to weather the elements, a dark 
tower shield lies here. A straight-edged sabre lies here, abandoned. The 
elegant form of a hornbow lies nearby. Its gray body limp, this fish is no 
more. With nowhere to go, this yellowish perch has stopped breathing. A bream 
lies dead here, its dark scales shimmering. There are 2 spotted walleyes here. 
A brook trout lies here helpless, its life gone. The small mouth of this bass 
unmoving, it lies dead. There are 2 Girdle of the Titans here. A well-crafted 
quiver has been left on the floor here. There are 7 Armband of Celerities here.
There are 2 mortal hearts here. A valuable wand of reflection has been 
carelessly discared here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring 
at you with its many eyes. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm 
sets its beady eyes on you. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in
the air here. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. 
This is a library. Saelen is here. Salis Fel'Amrit is here. He wields a lunar 
shield in his left hand and a Wolf's Fang glaive in his right. Aeorden Kei'daan
is here, shrouded. He wields a lunar shield in his left hand and a Sukhder 
daegger in his right. Jundi Lyon Zaridiux is riding on an armoured battle 
stallion.

Within the great Library of Caanae. (ruins of Caanae.)
There are 8 chunks of bone in a group here. A charred and bloodied chunk of 
someone's head lies here, mostly just skullcap. Lying at your feet is a 
bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and throbbing with life. Smoke issues from
this mutilated leg, the skin peeled back by scorching heat. The burnt remnant 
of someone's ear lies on the ground. Busily examining the library, Mathardan 
the Loresage wanders about. There are 2 monolith sigils here. Resting on the 
ground is a fist-shaped sigil. A dark mass of coalesced shadow lies here. A 
silver ring, set with a shimmering sapphire, rests upon the ground. There are 2
amethyst encrusted silver rings here. Left to weather the elements, a dark 
tower shield lies here. A straight-edged sabre lies here, abandoned. The 
elegant form of a hornbow lies nearby. Its gray body limp, this fish is no 
more. With nowhere to go, this yellowish perch has stopped breathing. A bream 
lies dead here, its dark scales shimmering. There are 2 spotted walleyes here. 
A brook trout lies here helpless, its life gone. The small mouth of this bass 
unmoving, it lies dead. There are 2 Girdle of the Titans here. A well-crafted 
quiver has been left on the floor here. There are 7 Armband of Celerities here.
There are 2 mortal hearts here. A valuable wand of reflection has been 
carelessly discared here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring 
at you with its many eyes. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm 
sets its beady eyes on you. A massive groomed black stallion stands here 
proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. The decaying remains 
of Lyon lie here. There are 3 maidenhair leaves in 2 groups here. There are 3 
pieces of kelp in a group here. There are 3 pieces of hyssop stem in 2 groups 
here. There are 3 juniper berries in 2 groups here. There are 3 toadstools in a
group here. There are 3 orphine seeds in 3 groups here. This is a library.

A rose-lined path to the library. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Light pink wings 
keeping her off the ground, a girl cherubim is giggling here. A small sign 
points into a market stall. A massive, wild tiger with fierce, emerald eyes 
prowls the immediate area for prey. A large cylindrical shield is propped 
nearby. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes

someone's head lies here, mostly just skullcap. Lying at your feet is a 
bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and throbbing with life. Smoke issues from
this mutilated leg, the skin peeled back by scorching heat. The burnt remnant 
of someone's ear lies on the ground. Busily examining the library, Mathardan 
the Loresage wanders about. There are 2 monolith sigils here. Resting on the 
ground is a fist-shaped sigil. A dark mass of coalesced shadow lies here. A 
silver ring, set with a shimmering sapphire, rests upon the ground. There are 2
