You slowly raise your hands towards the heavens, fists balled. Achieving harmony with Eloweth, you call upon Her immense power and utter a single word: "Burn!" With that, the power rushes out of you and into the shrine, spreading across the land to ignite the very souls of those who would oppose Eloweth.

Issue #96647   Reported by: Nearyku    Re: Sanai
2010-06-11 05:56:34: 
Alright that's it. I've tried so many times to solve whatever trumped up issues the character Sanai might have with Nearyku. I've let her kill him twice without hitting back once so that she would be violating pk rules if she keeps coming after me with huge teams and robbing my forge, my ingots, and anything else I drop when I die to worldburn. She's enemied me to the Order of Eloweth, no doubt on some other trumped up charges, and used it to slay me in my forge whileI was Smithing, then Khizan took my ingots and ran. These people are harassing me to the point that I am considering killing every single Khandavian I find, no matter who they are. Khizan, Laerten, Sanai, and a boatload of others have been teaming me every chance they get. She's slain me so many times I'm a level down now, and no one's done anything to stop this disgusting behavior. I tried to solve the problem so many times, challenging her to a duel to end it finally, asking nicely, everything. She is making my experience here a horrendous ordeal. Do something about this blatant disregard for other players and the rules of the game.

It all began when Nearyku randomly slew a friend of Sanai's who was also a Khandavan. After the first death, what followed was a carnival of Nearyku (or in some cases Nearyku's hound) attacking Sanai oftentimes simply for walking past him in some twisted attempt at self-preservation, something that earned him several more deaths. He'd also do things like 'get back from Dis, reject grace, kill Zearion' and somehow be surprised when Sanai appeared to avenge her guildmate's death, or be shocked when Sanai appears to defend her citymate Cardi. As I write this, Nearyku's hound began attacking Sanai when she entered the room with him. All attempts to resolve it beyond Nearyku raging and insisting he was going to 'kill every Khandavan he could find' have been foiled due to his early snubbing, and worldburn was a last resort to flush him out of the forge near Khandavan territory that he uses to continue to make a living with necromantic wares.
