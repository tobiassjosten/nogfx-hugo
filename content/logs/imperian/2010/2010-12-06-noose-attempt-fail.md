You take a glimpse at Alitis through the trees and shift around so that you are
concealed from sight.

You reach for a sturdy vine and begin silently to lower yourself down through 
the trees.

Gripping tightly with your legs, you push your body down through the foliage 
until your head and upper torso are free.

You begin to hold your breath as you inch the noose into position just over the
head of Alitis.

In a single fluid motion, you slip the noose over Alitis's head and jerk it 
upwards, lifting and throttling your victim.

Alitis gasps and chokes, bucking against the noose in a futile gesture of a 
struggle.

A tentacle shoots up from the ground, wraps itself around you, and drags you 
back to earth.
A junction of Wendigo catwalk.
This has been marked as holy ground. An icebox sits here. Arching up towards 
the sky, with a curtain of shifting light hung within it, the Lunar Pylon 
stands proudly here. Entrancingly placed in the room, someone has put a bread 
loaf shaped candle here. Lying on the ground is an oaken pipe. A fairly large 
group of charcoal cinders lies discarded here. You have entered the campground 
of Santhaea. The wise glance of a snow owl passes over you. Bundled in fur and 
leather, an Ithaquan village woman stands here silently. There are 2 Ithaquan 
villagers here. An elite young Warden sentry is manning a bolt thrower here. He
has eighty-eight bolts. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large cream
colored Graytrem draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. His muzzle grey 
and hoary with age, an elder of the village crouches here casting bones. 
Muscles rippling beneath black bone armour, a massive shire stands here poised 
and alert. A fierce sabretooth tiger prowls silently here. Absently shifting 
his weight, an owl of ghostly hues has perched here. There are 20 elite Warden 
lancers here. A powerful white she-wolf is lounging here, looking over her 
surroundings with a watchful eye. Carefully watching everything, a large, tan 
coloured tiger prowls here. Alitis, Aspect of Sukhder, is here, filling the 
surroundings with a miasma of fear. A cloud of smoke fills the area, coming 
from a campfire in the center of a campground. 
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.
You are no longer alone with your victim; you withdraw into the treetops.
