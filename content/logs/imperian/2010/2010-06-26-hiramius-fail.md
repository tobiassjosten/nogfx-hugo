You enter a fiery portal.
Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles 
listlessly in the wind. An ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally 
decorated pedestal here. The dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed 
brutally to the point of a rigid, black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, 
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. A magnificent flag, 
emblazoned with the crest of the Empire ripples regally from the columns of the
gates. A short, stone basin rests upon a pedestal here filled with blood. A 
captivating, wrought-iron display case sits here, decorated with an assortment 
of horseshoes, bone beads and feathers. Entrancingly placed in the room, 
someone has put a bread loaf shaped candle here. A well-made leather glove lies
upon the floor here. A plaque with a red-flecked obsidian border is here, 
script etched into its stehl face. There are 5 elegant white letters here. As 
big as an akrabi's tail, a glass broadsword has been decoratively placed here. 
A simple earthenware mug lies here, the faint scent of tea surrounding it. 
There are 3 buckets here. A pike with the decapitated head of Ageranu has been 
erected. There are 2 pike with the head of Hiramius on its here. A pike with 
the decapitated head of Mikihide has been erected. A pike with the decapitated 
head of Leoven has been erected. Floating in the air is a fiery portal. There 
are 15 elite elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. There are 26 elite Diavlous 
Knights here. An elite Diavlous Knight is manning a cannon here. He has 
eighty-one cannon balls. Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the 
Modin Valley stands here impassively. A stout llama grazes nearby. A Kenuba 
hippopotamus stands here, massive jaws agape. A pallid stallion stands here 
idly. A large, gold flecked hawk hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings 
shimmering in the light. A massive groomed black stallion stands here proudly, 
its large form covered in silver battle armour. Defiant in stance, a muscular 
white stallion stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes of ice
blue. A fetid stench informs you that a colossal one-eyed hound is here. There 
are 3 corpses of a baby rat here. The body of a young rat lies here. Incredibly
large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with 
confidence and aloofness. The ever-shifting visage of Jasmina, Aspect of 
Moradeim, is here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a curved 
sabre in her right. Sapp De'Linguilette is here, shrouded. He is holding a 
lunar shield in his right hand. Jasmina Xianfu is here.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east 
(gate open).
