Flowered primeval ruins. (lost) (northeastern battlegrounds.)
A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. There are 2 saltpetres in 
a group here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with 
its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to 
have a vicious glint to its eyes. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the 
north. Eyes glowing with mischief, a cunning coyote skulks about. Wings 
outstretched to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. 
Majestic in both appearance and bearing, a giant panda stands here, warily 
sniffing at her surroundings. Prowling about on silent paws, a swift cheetah 
watches you closely. Hunched over himself a brooding vulture snaps at anything 
in reach. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. 
Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. A thick canopy of trees 
blocks out the sunlight here. Silken Pae'ganis is here, cloaked by a swirling 
white mist.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

antelope, a red-tailed hawk, and a sleek harpy eagle.

Flowered primeval ruins. (northeastern battlegrounds.)
There are 2 saltpetres in a group here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly

A monolith within the glade. (northeastern battlegrounds.)
A circle of ash trees lance straight upwards in military precision, their trunks
at periodic points along the circumfrence. Several blooming flowers surround 
each base, forming another circle all while drawing attention to the strange 
monolith in the center of the glade. The natural stone juts upward from the 
forest floor and several sooty spots mark the location of many a previous 
campfire. Carved intials seem to cover every bit of the rock although several 
are more recent than others. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage
to the west. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A 
thick canopy of trees blocks out the sunlight here.

Blasted marsh. (northeastern battlegrounds.)
Hanging lichen brushes downwards from the boughs of the stunted trees that 
stutter across this blasted landscape. In stark relief wisps of light flicker in
the depths of the swamp, friendly bits of illumination that bely the deadly 
nature of the scenery. Half sunk remains of animals lie buried in the fetid 
waters, the inky blackness hiding their true size while eerie calls echo 
seemingly from within the sludge like fluid itself that flows around the various
obstacles. In the northeast there appears to be a stone slab that juts from the 
surroundings and still manages to catch attention despite its similar coloration
to its surroundings. A small pinch of saltpetre lies on the ground. There are 6 
charcoal cinders in a group here. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking 
passage to the east. A dangerous patch of quicksand awaits the careless 
traveller.

A fortified pass before the bridge. (central battlegrounds.)
Instilling bouts of claustrophobia within even the most hardy of individuals, 
the rock walls here soar over forty-feet on either side, making escape 
improbable once upon the rubble-strewn path. Though part of a smaller mountain 
separate from Phoenix Crest, archer holes strategically placed above provide 
telltale signs of passages within, once occupied by the inhabitants of the area.
Large boulders lie about alternately on both sides of the path, an obvious 
hinderance to caravans or other equipment coming through to the bridge on the 
far side of the pass. You shudder at the fate of any armies who dared attack the
Celidon from this eastern position. There are 6 charcoal cinders in a group

A worn, exposed stretch of bridge. (road). (central battlegrounds.)
The lonely call of a hawk circling above is sometimes cut short by the swirling 
winds along this stretch of bridge, the gusts taunting any who dare idle so far 
from the mountain on either side. For those who are able to navigate loose 
rubble underfoot and avoid worn rock walls that no longer provide a shield 
against the Waelin river below, feelings of fear are replaced by awe at the 
beauty of the lands of the Celidon. Greens, yellows, and browns create a

mountains that seem to reach through the clouds and towards the heavens 
themselves.

High atop an ancient bridge. (road). (central battlegrounds.)
Wide enough to allow side-by-side passage of several caravans, this ancient 
bridge spans the churning waters of the Waelin river far below. Though a natural
anomaly that connects the Phoenix Crest to a smaller mountain in the east, past 
engineers have modified the rock formation for both commercial and defensive 
purposes. Their work now sits in disarray, weeds peeking through cracked stone, 
constructed guard posts now half-standing amidst piles of rubble. The elements 
pound the area strongly here, and care must be taken near the exposed parts of 
the bridge where barriers have broken away.

A towering mountain pass. (central battlegrounds.)
Rising from the side of the mountain's eastern face, this narrow pass winds 
hundreds of feet above the wild lands of the Celidon below. Many sounds are 
muffled by walls of stone that soar upwards on either side of you, and sharp 
formations of granite jut out at unusual angles from both the path's floor and 
walls, making travel slow and dangerous. The road becomes even more trecherous 
as it snakes downward here, though farther to the east is a reprieve from the 
ancient rock formations.
You see exits leading east, northwest, and down.

High atop an ancient bridge. (road). (central battlegrounds.)
Wide enough to allow side-by-side passage of several caravans, this ancient 
bridge spans the churning waters of the Waelin river far below. Though a natural
anomaly that connects the Phoenix Crest to a smaller mountain in the east, past 
engineers have modified the rock formation for both commercial and defensive 
purposes. Their work now sits in disarray, weeds peeking through cracked stone, 
constructed guard posts now half-standing amidst piles of rubble. The elements 
pound the area strongly here, and care must be taken near the exposed parts of 
the bridge where barriers have broken away. Dripping with blood, an inverted 
pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows 
bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the
darkness. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.

A worn, exposed stretch of bridge. (road). (central battlegrounds.)
The lonely call of a hawk circling above is sometimes cut short by the swirling 
winds along this stretch of bridge, the gusts taunting any who dare idle so far 
from the mountain on either side. For those who are able to navigate loose 
rubble underfoot and avoid worn rock walls that no longer provide a shield 
against the Waelin river below, feelings of fear are replaced by awe at the 
beauty of the lands of the Celidon. Greens, yellows, and browns create a 
patchwork quilt of unsurpassed beauty, accentuated by the grandeur of the 
mountains that seem to reach through the clouds and towards the heavens 
themselves. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.

A fortified pass before the bridge. (central battlegrounds.)
Instilling bouts of claustrophobia within even the most hardy of individuals, 
the rock walls here soar over forty-feet on either side, making escape 
improbable once upon the rubble-strewn path. Though part of a smaller mountain 
separate from Phoenix Crest, archer holes strategically placed above provide 
telltale signs of passages within, once occupied by the inhabitants of the area.
Large boulders lie about alternately on both sides of the path, an obvious 
hinderance to caravans or other equipment coming through to the bridge on the 
far side of the pass. You shudder at the fate of any armies who dared attack the
Celidon from this eastern position. There are 6 charcoal cinders in a group 
here. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black,

Blasted marsh. (lost) (northeastern battlegrounds.)
Hanging lichen brushes downwards from the boughs of the stunted trees that 
stutter across this blasted landscape. In stark relief wisps of light flicker in
the depths of the swamp, friendly bits of illumination that bely the deadly 
nature of the scenery. Half sunk remains of animals lie buried in the fetid 
waters, the inky blackness hiding their true size while eerie calls echo 
seemingly from within the sludge like fluid itself that flows around the various
obstacles. In the northeast there appears to be a stone slab that juts from the 
surroundings and still manages to catch attention despite its similar coloration
to its surroundings. A small pinch of saltpetre lies on the ground. There are 6 
charcoal cinders in a group here. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking

the depths of the swamp, friendly bits of illumination that bely the deadly 
nature of the scenery. Half sunk remains of animals lie buried in the fetid 
waters, the inky blackness hiding their true size while eerie calls echo 
seemingly from within the sludge like fluid itself that flows around the various
obstacles. In the northeast there appears to be a stone slab that juts from the 
surroundings and still manages to catch attention despite its similar coloration
to its surroundings. A small pinch of saltpetre lies on the ground. There are 6 
charcoal cinders in a group here. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking 
passage to the east. A dangerous patch of quicksand awaits the careless 
traveller.
You see exits leading northeast, east, and southwest.

A monolith within the glade. (northeastern battlegrounds.)
A circle of ash trees lance straight upwards in military precision, their trunks
at periodic points along the circumfrence. Several blooming flowers surround 
each base, forming another circle all while drawing attention to the strange 
monolith in the center of the glade. The natural stone juts upward from the 
forest floor and several sooty spots mark the location of many a previous 
campfire. Carved intials seem to cover every bit of the rock although several 
are more recent than others. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage
to the west. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A 
black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. A 
thick canopy of trees blocks out the sunlight here.
You see exits leading north, east, and west.

Flowered primeval ruins. (northeastern battlegrounds.)
The primeval forest has overtaken and reigns supreme in this locale. Hanging 
vines ensnare the foot of unwary travelers while the calls and songs of various 
species of animal life echo around the entire area. Delicate streamers of 
mushrooms lined up in a row grow from several nearby surfaces while what seems 
to be an old path has long since been left to ruin. The ancient stones that 
lined the walkway lie crumbled, flora bursting from its seams and covering it in
a riot of color, whose scent wafts throughout the air filling it with a heavy 
aroma. There are 2 saltpetres in a group here. An icewall is here, blocking 
passage to the north. A thick canopy of trees blocks out the sunlight here.

Lone oak amidst the jungle. (northeastern battlegrounds.)
Tumbled piles of deadwood lie overgrown and in disarray having quickly succumbed
to the massive growth of random ferns and mosses. The forest has given way to a 
more feral topography as the vines exploding from the boughs overhead have 
turned it into a veritable jungle. A lone oak tree futilely attempts to thrusts 
its way towards the sky but the encroaching wilderness deprives the tree of any 
nutrients and sunlight it seeks. Beds of decaying matter lie about and several 
ants march around feeding on the plants. A small pinch of saltpetre lies on the 
ground. A muscular mountain lion prowls here, searching for prey. A large 
beehive hangs down from the trees above. A mighty earth golem stands guard here.
There are 7 charcoal cinders in a group here. A small forest of sharpened 
crystals protrudes from the ground. A thick canopy of trees blocks out the

an elemental staff in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
