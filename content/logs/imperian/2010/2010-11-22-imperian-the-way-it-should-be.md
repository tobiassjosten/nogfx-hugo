Sanai tells you, "Come to the Archway, though you may wish to leave your affiliations before you do lest you wander into the guards or siege."

You tell Lady Sanai Vladin, Aryana's Judgement, "Oh yeah, Spectres are unwelcome now.. I don't suppose there is a renegade guild in Khandava, or some way to access a toxinlab?"
