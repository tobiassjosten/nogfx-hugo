--- Aryana's Spring --------------- 0:0:0 ---
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. The once grand market square of ancient Caanae surrounds this centralized point, where the ground has been shaken and torn apart by a catastrophic event. Three meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic scripts lie collapsed upon the ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean askew to one side of the stone pile, blocking the view from outside of all the wonders housed within this temple. Barely standing under the weight of a pillar is a marble altar, which has been etched with scars and scratches from the passage of time and elements. The structure of the pillars silently displays how it was once a small but impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar indicate it to have been built in honor of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the cracks in the centre is a passage of pure water, perhaps the purest known in the realm of Aetherius. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and striking monument. A small sign points into a market stall. A sachet of bath salts has been left here, the enchanting scent of vanilla wafting from the small parcel. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. From its perch, a night black hawk watches you intently with steady golden eyes. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Sapp De'Linguilette is here, shrouded. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand and a lunar shield in his right. Apostle Sidartha Elochai, Ascetic of Body is here. Wytch, Azyel Shinpachi, Thau Rissian is riding on a massive warhorse. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a living vodun doll of Oburi in his right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway leads down.

--- Aryana's Spring --------------- 0:0:0 ---
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. A delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and striking monument. A small sign points into a market stall. A sachet of bath salts has been left here, the enchanting scent of vanilla wafting from the small parcel. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. From its perch, a night black hawk watches you intently with steady golden eyes. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. Apostle Sidartha Elochai, Ascetic of Body is here. Sapp De'Linguilette is here, shrouded. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand and a lunar shield in his right. Wytch, Azyel Shinpachi, Thau Rissian is riding on a massive warhorse. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a living vodun doll of Oburi in his right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway leads down.
