You wrinkle your nose and sniff.

A masked man nods his head in greeting.

You say to a masked man, "A few questions."

Ignacio begins to follow you.

A masked man says, "Of course."

You say to a masked man, "First of all."

You prod a masked man in the chest.

A masked man raises an eyebrow at you.

You ask a masked man, "Did you really think you could fool people?"

The chamber of salvation.
Located far below the sweltering heat of the desert, this chamber has a damp and dreary air to it. The stone walls are perfectly circular, though the faultless sandstone is marred by ritualistic symbols scrawled haphazardly across it in what appears to be blood. Two lone torches adorn the walls opposite one another, held in place by blackened steel. They cast most of the chamber in a dim, eerie light, while the rest is left in shadow. Unsettling reddish-brown stains can be seen on the stone floor, and long forgotten bones have been heaped to one side, adding a disturbing feel to the gloomy room. This has been marked as holy ground. A blackened stehl crank juts out of the ladder rack. A desert wolf paces here, ears cocked alertly. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Tekkor Askare is here. He wields an ivory sitara in his right hand.
You see a single exit leading north (closed door).

You say, "You sicken me."

Tekkor arrives from the north.

You close the door to the north.

A masked man opens his mouth and slowly says, "Uhhh."

You say, "Remove your mask."

Ignacio releases the clasp on his mask, revealing himself.

You narrow your eyes at Ignacio in an unnerving manner.

You say to Ignacio, "You understand what I am speaking of?"

Nyaos watches Ignacio intently, a gleam evident in her eyes, before quickly lighting another torch on the wall. Torchlight dances about the room unpredictably, casting erratic shadows.

You say to Ignacio, "You said Shadeau and Asator were the ones there, that you saw nothing out of the ordinary."

Ignacio Shinpachi looks to the blood-stained floor, thoughtfully watching the shadows dance, before looking back at Nyaos, eyes defiant as he says, "I did nothing wrong, only my duty as a spy, unfortunately nothing was to be gleaned from the encounter... Nothing of worth anyways."

You have emoted: A low hiss emanating from her throat, Nyaos draws herself up to her full height. "Nothing wrong?" She demands to know of Ignacio. "Nothing wrong?!"

You say to Ignacio, "What is wrong is fucking the enemy."

"Pfft!" Ignacio exclaims.

Ignacio Shinpachi says, "I did no such thing."

You say to Ignacio, "Continue to lie and I will have your tongue pulled from your throat."

Ignacio snaps his jaw shut, rigid with barely contained anger.

You say to Ignacio, "You maintain your innocence?"

Ignacio Shinpachi says, "You won't get any other answers from me Nyaos, I've told you what happened."

Tekkor Askare says to Ignacio, "You will address the Ordikara by her title."

You have emoted: Nyaos clicks and chitters softly as she steps closer, a hand resting on the grip of her sitara. "Yes," she says to Ignacio, giving Tekkor an acknowledging nod. "You will."

You say to Ignacio, "Tell me, Ignacio, what you know of magick."

Ignacio Shinpachi says, "I know it is a dirty disgusting thing that needs to be wiped from Aetherius."

You have emoted: Nyaos studies Ignacio intently, a wry smile twisting her features suddenly. "Do you understand how far the clutching roots of magick will go into the mind of an individual?"

"I don't know what you are talking about," Ignacio says flippantly, adding, "Ordikara," as he glances over at Tekkor with slight disdain. "I thought you asked me here so that I could prove my innocence, not accuse me of this foolishness. Perhaps I should just go..."

You say to Ignacio, "I see no innocence to prove."

You say to Ignacio, "You will be tried on the rack."

You open a pair of hammered bronze cuffs.

-calling people to guildhall. fun times.-

You tap your foot with mild impatience.

Ossilr gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

Tekkor Askare says, "We are all here."

You say to Ignacio, "Emerge, please."

Ossilr nods sagely.

Ignacio emerges from his hiding place.

You say, "Abhaen, we fight magick, we do not seduce its wielders."

You ask, "Am I correct?"

Trethyn nods.

Ossilr nods sagely.

You have emoted: Nyaos glances askance at Ignacio as she steps to the center of the room, tail swinging slowly behind her. "We have no patience for this. Treason, heresy, lies have been spilled forth today."

You say, "And now, blood will be spilled as well."

You close a pair of hammered bronze cuffs.

Trethyn steps back slightly, her tail moving in closer to her.

As you slowly turn the wooden crank, Ignacio is slowly stretched to full length.

Ossilr Amakiir sets a hand on Trethyn's shoulder, steadying his comrade.

Helios Anar watches on impassively.

You say to Ignacio, "It's unfortunate that you, claiming to have been spying, were likewise being spied upon."

Eyes wide as Nyaos turns the crank, pulling his arms and legs taut Ignacio says, "This, this is absolutely ridiculous, surely you don't believe I would betray the Abhaen so?"

Tekkor Askare says, "Then weither you thought the information was important or not, you should have produced the results of your spying."

You say to Tekkor, "The results of his 'spying' was an enlarged member."

You spit in Ignacio's face.

Tekkor gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

Tekkor Askare says to you, "Please continue Ordikara."

You give Tekkor a wry, shifty smile.

You have emoted: Nyaos turns to the rest present, giving a short laugh that echoes harshly around the chamber. "Do you see?" She asks, a strange glint in her eyes. "Our enemy is not just outside these walls."

Turning the crank further, you hear Ignacio's joints popping slightly, as the board moves to force him to be forced to lean back a bit.

You ask Trethyn, "Am I right? We have seen the attempts to infiltrate this very guild?"

You tilt your head and listen intently to Trethyn.

Tekkor tilts his head and listens intently to Trethyn.

Trethyn holds herself still, watching the pain of Ignacio.

Clenching his jaw tight as he is stretched a bit further Ignacio looks at Nyaos, eyes full of hatred as he says, "This is what I get for serving my city and guild? Tortured until I tell you what you want me to say?"

You say to Ignacio, "A man can only hold out against the Truth for so long, fool."

Ossilr Amakiir gently shakes Trethyn.

Helios Anar crosses his arms across his chest as he leans back against the stone wall of the chamber while muttering to himself, "Everyone has their time.."

You tell Archimandrite Diaktoros Iavas, in Sidhe, "Your clinical analysis is disrupting my methodical dismemberment."

Giving the wooden crank another turn, you grin as the board forces Ignacio to lean back, creating a perfect, agonizing triangle with the floor.

Muffled cries of agony and alarm seem to resonate deep beneath the city of Antioch, the pitch quivering from low to high as it reaches the desert streets.

(Antioch): Song says, "What was that?"

You say to Ignacio, "Repent, you liar."

(Antioch): Diaktoros says, "What?"

You say to Ignacio, "You twist the truth to suit your pleasures."

(Antioch): Aislygn says, "Abhaen torture."

(Antioch): Diaktoros says, "Oh, right."

Trethyn grimaces slightly but her eyes show no compassion as she watches.

(Antioch): Song says, "I believe Lord Baar would be proud of the Abhaen."

Ignacio Shinpachi amidst the screams of pain "I--I didn't" can be heard at first, before sputtering out quickly "I did it! I I enjoyed every second of it too, and I wish Miichelle hadn't interrupted so I could have had it all!" Horrified that he spoke the truth, seemingly unwillingly he screams out in rage as well as pain now, wishing for it to end.

You see Ignacio Shinpachi yell, "Damn you, damn you all to Dis for eternity!"

You turn the crank a final time, hearing it latch into place. As you do, the sounds of Ignacio's joints popping out of his sockets with a loud crunching noise fills the chamber, as his life leaves his body. An intense, shrill cry breaks through the desert air, cutting off sharply just before reaching its apex.
Ignacio has died to torture at Nyaos's hands.

Trethyn openly sneers, clicking slightly, what little compassion was left is entirely gone from her face.

-

Fitz tells you, "You got it working?"

You tell Fitz Melloryn, "What does it seem like, Wytchen?"

Fitz tells you, "Oh please. There's no need to be rude. I've only ever been 
polite with you."

Fitz tells you, "I am in the middle of trying to congratulate you. Finding lost knowledge is no easy task."

You tell Fitz Melloryn, "Hm. Indeed."

-

You say, "Abhaen, every day is a day we should spill blood."

You say, "Whether a heretic inside or outside these walls, we will find them. We walk the Holy Path, and will burn those aiming to continue the spread of the Taint."

You say, "May we cast our enemies' blood throughout the sands, their blood streaking the skies."

You have emoted: Nyaos glances at the broken remains of Ignacio before looking up, meeting the eye of each present in turn. "Your attendance, I thank you for it."

You say, "You are dismissed.. rest as you wish, but forget not these events."
