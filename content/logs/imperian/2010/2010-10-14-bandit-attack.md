You follow Kuroda to the west.
Between the cacti.
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. You see exits leading 
northeast and east.
Kuroda springs a trap!
Netting falls around Kuroda and roughly pulls him to the ground, as a group of 
bandits appears from nowhere.

Two arrows come flying in from nowhere, striking a masked akrabi and a 
copper-scaled ssylsin! Over the shrieks of pain, you hear voices yelling, "Over
here, over here!"

A copper-scaled ssylsin slashes into Kuroda's skin, exposing his to his toxic 
poisons.
Kuroda screams in pain as deadly toxins tear through his body.

A Cleric scout yells, "Bandits! Over there!"

You see a Cleric scout yell, "Here, here!"
Desert scouts rush in from nearby to your defense, engaging your attackers 
immediately.

A lamiran bandit claws weakly at Kuroda.

A masked akrabi procures two obsidian daggers from seemingly nowhere and fires 
them off at Kuroda in rapid succession.
Kuroda's body ceases to move as his body stiffens into paralysis.

A copper-scaled ssylsin slashes into Kuroda's skin, exposing his to his toxic 
poisons.
Kuroda screams in pain as deadly toxins tear through his body.

A lamiran bandit takes a quick glance up at the sky, before running off into 
the distance.
A foul-smelling lamiran bandit slinks off to the northeast, snivelling to 
himself.

A copper-scaled ssylsin takes a quick glance up at the sky, before running off 
into the distance.
A copper-scaled ssylsin creeps out to the northeast.

A masked akrabi takes a quick glance up at the sky, before running off into the
distance.
With a quick glance about him, a masked akrabi leaves to the northeast.

A Cleric scout exclaims, "After them, men!"
 
A Justicar scout exclaims, "Aye!"

A Pa'kitaru huntress leaves to the northeast, a wyvern reflected in her eyes.
A Justicar scout leaves with a steady pace to the northeast.
With a high-pitched yelp, a beautiful hound trots proudly out to the northeast.
