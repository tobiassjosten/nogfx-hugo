2010/12/21 11:23:42 - Mikihide > At this time alchemy is restricted to Bards 
until further talks by the mage leaders. The Bardic guild has proven time and 
time again to work against the Duke, Laws of Kinsarmar, and The citizens in 
general.
2010/12/21 11:42:30 - Mikihide > also the above log is to stay guild knowledge.
2010/12/21 11:45:42 - Mikihide > to clarify if your reading this differently, 
no it does not mean bards only get alchemy. it means they get none at all, zero
alchemy for bards until further notice.

The mages tried back pedaling, said it was only for a month and was supposed to be secret and wanted the traitors name who told me. I refused, I took Duke cause frankly, having one guild think they are above the city? Ludicrious. I get it, make my post, which was...


To make a few things clear,

I did not ask to become Duke with a cheerful heart. It was reluctant but I felt it had to be done. There are several things that worried me over the year but at last too much has happened for me to sit back.

One, as I posted earlier, the Mage leadership was preparing to ban the bards guild from the alchemy lab. This was supposed to be secret but someone was brave enough to tell me. They not only said that, but called the bards traitors, subversives and the like. There is reasonable guild secrets and policies, but this is not one of them. If any guild was going to do such a thing as this, then one should tell and not be silent. I refused to name the person who told me and the name or names will never be said.

Each guild is a part of the city, not greater then it. When guild goes up against city, the Duchy shall triumph, no matter which guild it is. The alchemy room is a vital resource for the city at large. The mage guild can and should regulate it against those who misuse it, but to deny it to an entire guild of the city is not something that can stand. Deny it to traitors who sell alchemy, deny it to city enemies, but as long as someone is in good standing in the Duchy, they should have reasonable access to alchemy and they will by my word. If they sell it to those that should not have it, they will be denied access, enemied and ousted if they are a citizen. The guilds will support the Duchy, but when Duchy comes in conflict with guild, the Duchy shall triumph, for an arm can not claim primacy over the rest of the body. That is foolishness and can not stand.

Furthermore, to quote from our canon,

II.
An Erege has the capability of overriding any minister at any time.

III.
During extenuating circumstances, an Erege may give an executive order
to any citizen or group of citizens. The citizen or group of citizens
must obey that order as long as it does not violate Canon Law.

IV.
An Erege has the power to interpret Canon Law, subject to being
overridden by the Duchess, Duke, or the Council of Ereges.

No more will any minister over rule an Erege, unless a plurality of the council agrees. No more will someone with higher authority verbally authorise one to do such an action and not leave note before it happens. There are laws and a clear chain of command. If someone is abusing authority, we have means to deal with that. If someone is in a ministry and abusing it, an Erege or the Duke, me, will deal with it. So to clarify, no verbal authorizations, he or she said I could discipline someone who is in a higher position of authority. And that is the end of that.

Finally, all ministry positions are now open, send me a letter if you wish to have a job and current ministers let me know if you want to keep your job and give me reasons why you should keep it.

That is all.

And then my third supporter caves and gives it back to Sorin.

You recall that Sorin said:
"Leave it Ivellios. I will no longer spar with you over this issue. I will no 
longer allow any minister, or official take it upon themselves to destroy the 
peace in this city for the "Good" of the duchy. We are a city embodied by 
Individuals. And in order to make sure things work as they do, we cannot let 
our personal lives rule us, or our decisions. It must be our laws, not our 
vindictiveness. Learn that lessons please."

You recall that Mathiaus said:
"Ivellios, as a Baron and Erege, I ask you stand down now."

You recall that Ivellios said:
"He acts as if he is the highest authority of the land, he sweet talks you but 
behind your back, he is plotting for your seat."

You recall that Mathiaus said:
"I say this only once more; as having a higher rank and erege status, I ask you
stand down, now, Ivellios. Not another word."
<394/343h 419/471m 1617e 2258w 65x <ebpp> <bd>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Mathiaus.
<394/343h 419/471m 1617e 2258w 65x <ebpp> <bd>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  
Mathiaus rubs some salve on his skin.

You recall that Ivellios said:
"Higher rank cause a minister who refuses to ever do anything I ask, who nearly
got us permanently estranged from both Khandava and Celidon, who mentions, 
"treaties with Stavenn and the Anti-Magick circle," which is news to me. 
Ithaqua after they destroyed us, destroyed us, ruined our defenses, destroyed 
all our siege, got tired fo us. There was no treaty with them. And the last 
treaty we had with Stavenn was when Justus was Commander of War, there is no 
new treaty Dias negotiated, and I highly doubt one would last with his constant
vortexing of their leaders. The only reason why you are higher ranked is cause 
that minister who thinks so highly, disfavoured me."

Yes, Sorin thinks its fine for a minister to over ride an erege and to have the mage guild run amuck. And people don't see how ludicrious it is.
