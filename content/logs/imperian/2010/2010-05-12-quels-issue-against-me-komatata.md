So after the obelisk battle I figured id kill Quel for his cheap shot radiance. I succeeded and this is the response I got from dis.
issue #96520   Reported by: Quel    Re: Komatata

I was unaware that you could kill someone just for participating in the new 
Obelisk system. If that's the case, I will no longer participate in such a 
flawed system. I have never interacted with this person beyond competing 
against them in the Obelisk system. I'm not interested anymore in participating
in Imperian combat, and I would like clarification on this issue.

You sent the following message to Quel: Really??
