</font><font color="#008080">You give a single perfect flame colored rose to Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale.

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale takes the brightly colored blossom from you 
and brings it to her face, burying her nose amidst the oddly warm petals as sheinhales the deep perfume.

</font><font color="#00FFFF">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale says, "Lord Captain Kazeem el A'takari. Knight of the Justicars and brave leader of the city Guard. Never has a finer man walked the sands. Yet his story is a sad one..."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "You know of course of the First Demon Incursion. So very, very long ago. Antioch was different then, what you see now is what was rebuilt over what was destroyed in the war."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "Old Town is a remnant that was not reclaimed...the things that happened here...well..it was best left to the sand and forgotten."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "The battle raged for weeks outside of the walls. The sand all around was black from demonic spawn. Yet by some miracle each charge led by our Justicars and clerics drove them back, time after time. Yet it was taking a toll...so many, so weary..."

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale sighs softly and brushes the rose along her cheek.

</font><font color="#008080">Harem Guard, Gorruh Bubbazba, Head Bouncer shifts his position, the dull creaking of armour catching your attention.

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "The bonfires burned each night. The demons HATED the fire and feared it greatly. Yet on this night a terrible storm was raging in the desert and the fires were very low. The demon forces held back, the sand blasting into them and killing hundreds, scattering countless more. Yet...finally it caused the fires to go out."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "In the face of this storm, many in the city had taken to their homes and the walls had largely been abandoned as it was believed nothing could survive the terrible storm that raged in the desert."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "It proved a terrible mistake. Whipped into frenzy by a demonic Commander, the demon horde attacked in the middle of the storm. Terrible magicks that had not before been seen blasted the walls and finally they breached the city and poured in..."

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale shivers and catches her breath, her skin going pale.
 
</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "I...will not speak to you of the atrocities. There are no words, and the images are not meant to be left in mortal minds. It is enough for you to know, that no enemy you may face in your daily battle will conceive of the...inhumanities...they committed upon those they came upon."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "Kazeem rallied citizen and guard alike and fell back into position...many had come here for solace and protection by the Gods..."

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale frowns slightly, her lips thinning as an old anger sparks in her pale eyes.

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "...but there was no protection save for one heroic warrior wielding a legendary sword and a handful of his most valiant fellow knight. They stood at the doors...and battled wave after wave of nightmarish creatures."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "I do not know if it was days or hours..but eventually their prayer to keep the demons at bay were no longer heeded. They had lost the spiritual energy to muster them. They were cut off from the other troops and out of healing supplies. Only the divine power captured in Kazeem's sword, Demonsbane, was left to hold the hordes at bay."

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "The brave, brave knight struck a blow with all his flagging strength...and his sword snapped within the demon's breast."

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale pauses, her pale eyes haunted as if seeing it for herself.
 
</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "At this final loss, his faith in the gods shattered also...for he knew now all those he had sworn to protect would die. Even as he drew a replacement sword of simple steel he cursed the Gods for abandoning him...for abandoning those that cowered within the depths of the temple."

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale lowers her eyes, her head bowed as tears well in her eyes. After a moment she begins again, her own grief and sorrow touching your thoughts.

</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "He died there. Cut down like an animal...no..worse...much worse..and as he had known would happen if he fell, the frenzied demons gained the depths of the temple and the people there..women..children...men...it mattered not. Their horror is still there to be seen if you walk into that cursed room and see what memory of that day is left upon the very stone of the floor."

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale gazes at the rose, a single tear falling from her cheek to tremble on a silken petal like a drop of dew.
 
</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "Yet there they say...on the very stone into which his precious blood spilled...in the days after Lord Baar came to the memories of men once more...a tender shoot sprang from cracked and descrated stone. A rose grew, where no rose should grow...unlike any other...as bright and vibrant as the flames that eruped around the Demon's Gate itself."

Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale smiles at you then, as she shows you the rose.
 
</font><font color="#FFFF00">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale tells you, "It is a promise...and an acknowledgement of the great courage shown in the face of evil. A reminder that there is hope and that he is not forgotten. He walks now in ghostly form..still on watch...but this rose is a pact that one day his patrols will end and he will be taken home to the side of the Gods he served so well. One day, he will be forgiven..if..somehow..he can forgive himself."

</font><font color="#008080">Tyl Ammairra, Desert Nightingale sets the rose on the table in front of her gently, and takes her glass, sipping from it as she turns away, her tale ended and her thoughts close in on themselves.
