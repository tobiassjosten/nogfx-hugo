--- Aryana's Spring --------------- 0:0:0 ---
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune 
circle has been sketched into the ground here. The spring of crystalline water 
gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a 
shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of 
inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the 
floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite 
stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A 
shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A 
detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic 
features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering 
puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at 
the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning 
statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small sign 
points into a market stall. With a wild look in his eye, a feral paint stallion 
stands heatedly here as he stomps and paces recklessly. Tomast the Cleric stands
here, his gaze cast over the Springs. There are 6 corpses of a giant tarantula 
here. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you. Raini 
Sunjackal is here. She wields a strong broadsword in her left hand and a mithril
shield in her right. Altiere is here. He is holding a miner's pick in his left 
hand. Brother Jimek Qaqyesil is here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune 
circle has been sketched into the ground here. The spring of crystalline water 
gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a 
shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of 
inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the 
floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey granite 
stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A 
shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A 
detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic 
features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering 
puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at 
the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning 
statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small sign 
points into a market stall. With a wild look in his eye, a feral paint stallion 
stands heatedly here as he stomps and paces recklessly. Tomast the Cleric stands
here, his gaze cast over the Springs. There are 6 corpses of a giant tarantula 
here. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you. Raini 
Sunjackal is here. She wields a strong broadsword in her left hand and a mithril
shield in her right. Altiere is here. He is holding a miner's pick in his left 
hand. Brother Jimek Qaqyesil is here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
