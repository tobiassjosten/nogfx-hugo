Wide dusty plain adjoining Savannah.
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. A smattering of clouds fills the 
sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. You are in a land which is caught 
between conflicting influences, inhabiting the periphery of the deserts, the 
grasslands to the east, and far to the west the Areish mountains which tower 
over you with their impressive bulk. Here however is a barren and almost 
featureless wilderness where little grows, a place exposed to the ravages of the
elements and which offer the traveler little in the way of succour. A sigil in 
the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Yellow rosebushes 
erupt in full bloom around a nearly translucent pillar, where a large topaz key 
spins gently on its end. A large beehive hangs down from the trees above. The 
decaying remains of Runi lie here. Barely visible, a black ant lies crushed on 
the ground. A swarm of bees hovers menacingly nearby. A mighty earth golem 
stands guard here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Juran, Aspect 
of Aryana. He wields a Druidic quarterstaff in his hands. Sir Justus Thorondor 
is here, hidden. He wields a whip of jagged copper cable in his left hand and a 
crude Dragontooth dirk in his right. Several large white oak trees form a 
peaceful grove. 
You see a single exit leading southeast.
