You recall that Kaem said:
"Selling protection against the stalker like tendencies of Ironbeard and his 
wired teleporting bellyrubbing!"

You recall that Kaem said:
"Selling dancing lessons for those who wish to dazzle Ironbeard with their 
marvelous footwork!"

You recall that Sadie said:
"1000 gold to the first person who ends Kaem. I would, but it's so effort."

The Spirit of Antioch. (City of Antioch.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The room you find yourself in seems 
to be shaded and cool, almost refreshingly so when compared to the heat of the 
city. The walls are a soft hue of sandstone, two oil lamps hanging on opposite 
sides, casting enough light to banish the stray shadows from the corners of the
room. A small opening in the ceiling, sealed with a wooden hatch, allows for 
extra light during the day by swinging it open onto a bracing rod. The floor 
has been covered with a coarsely woven, soft rug, which stretches from wall to 
wall, and allows for the air to pass under hot feet. Several piles of pillows 
lay in one semi-shady corner, the perfect respite from the day to day hustle 
and bustle. On the wall near the door, there is a small window, sealed with a 
half opened canvas flap, the sounds from the Shuk echoing through quietly. This
has been marked as holy ground. A glass windchime has been hung here, the lily 
pads that hang from it constantly clanking together in a soothingly melodic 
manner. A deep green hammock suspended from a smooth mahogany frame sits here, 
swaying gently with any breeze. A very large group of charcoal cinders rests on
the ground. You have entered the campground of Ellanora. An elite Antioch 
cleric is manning a trebuchet here. She has 105 stone commodities. Compeer 
Guardsman Kaem Savann, The Sand Viper is here, hidden. A cloud of smoke fills 
the area, coming from a campfire in the center of a campground. 
You see a single exit leading west.
