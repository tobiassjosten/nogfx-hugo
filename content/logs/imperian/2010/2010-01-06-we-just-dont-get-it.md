Crossing a shaky causeway. (road). (North Eastern Arena.)
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A black 
ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. The 
undead form of Trevize is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a
wicked-looking daegger in his right. Jundi Shukron, Disciple of Song is here, 
sprawled on the ground. He wields a lunar shield in his left hand and a 
broadsword of Vahin in his right.
