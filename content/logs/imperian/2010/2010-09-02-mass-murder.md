 Reed banks by the Ederith. (Modin Valley.) You are within the gently rolling Modin valley, cast in the shadow of the twin  ranges of hills which rise up in either side of you now, casting a perpetual  shadow over the land. Through this valley, which is abundant with flora and  fauna of all kinds, flows the river Ederith, by which you now stand, surrounded by the tall swaying reeds which have thrust their heads above the level of the  water. The reeds whisper sibilantly as the gentle breezes rustle through them.  Gore is splattered about, a display of Dias's cruel handiwork. A magickal  lightwall radiates powerfully over the south exit. The decaying remains of  Kaeso lie here. There are 4 orphine seeds in 4 groups here. There are 2  maidenhair leaves in a group here. There are 2 pieces of kelp in a group here.  There are 2 pieces of hyssop stem in a group here. There are 2 juniper berries  in a group here. There are 2 toadstools in 2 groups here. A common red admiral  butterfly flits about over your head. A small black cobra is flaring its hood  here. You see exits leading north and south.
