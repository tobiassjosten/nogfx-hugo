A murky pool. (North Eastern Arena.)
The bowl-like shape of the arena is this one area has resulted in a fairly large
pool of water that has collected from the years of rain that poured down here. 
Underwater, the outline of a small room can be faintly seen with the dim light 
filtering through the opaque water. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the 
down. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. Surrounded
by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her 
silken ribbons trailing to the ground. A fiery efreeti spins madly here. 
Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here 
with confidence and aloofness. Diaktoros Iavas is here, giving off a truly 
ghastly stench.
You see exits leading west and down.
