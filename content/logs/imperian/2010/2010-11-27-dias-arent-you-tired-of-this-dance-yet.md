Issue #100503   Reported by: Dias    Re: Lyla
2010-11-26 19:28:28: 
Attempting to incriminate Greggoyr and I upon HELP MULTIPLAYING. I believe that the deal was that Lyla could not speak my name and I could not speak hers, ect  ect, alts and all. Regardless of Greggory and I not being the same person (You can check Tylers IP address) and my own (Jordan). Lyla is purposefully attempting to ruin my gameplay and dispel the illusion of the game which is against the rules. Please, do some thing about this 'thing'.

replyissue 100503 alright. I don't even know why or for what I am being issued for here. I have complied with all your rules and regulations and resent these petty attempts to try and bait me into saying or doing something that will get me shrubbed. From them joining my guilds to waltzing in and out of my grove multiple times and hanging there. My grove is out in culpher hills a lil dead end island with one exit and nothing in it so there is no reason to go in it more then twice in a row. Since this issue was given to me both Greggory and Dias have been in it  repeatedly. Dias kestrel still sits in my grove even as I write. I could yell violation to the high heavens and as much as I resent and likely hate Dias/Jordan, its not my goal to get him boot, just to keep him away. I could issue for harassment or griefing or something I am sure, but its not worth it. I am busy playing this game and trying to enjoy myself. Those two were the last thing on my mind til this point.
