Fanning herself slowly with a delicate contraption of lace and wood, Kye smiles inwardly as she notices the gaze of the young warrior once again slide toward her. Tall, proud and so deliciously young, the ordinarily elegant and graceful boy stumbles in his waltz once more, drawing a throaty chuckle from the sensual lycan. She appraises him openly, her eyes taking in his well toned muscles and confident stance and only confirming the necessity of her course. She is forced to conclude that there is simply no way her factions champion could truimph on the morrow against this warrior in the morning\'s youth tournament, and the loss of prestige from such a loss would be too great to bear. 

With a pronunced sway in her step she makes her way across the dance floor, flitting easily between dancing couples as she makes to pass her target. She brushes past him, a movement to sensual and deliberate to be misinterpreted and whispers a room number into his ear even as her ample chest and toned legs grind against him. Moving past, she heads in the direction of the stairs, turning her head only once to offer the stunned warrior a seductive smile as she heads off in the direction of her suite. 

Once within her movements are swift. She removes her clothing, artistically placing each discarded item in a pattern along the furniture so as to take the aroused mind of her guest on a journey of imagination. As she requested, the large tub is filled with hot water, near steaming and adorned with rose petals. She moves about the room quickly, lighting aromatic candles with just a hint of aconite, designed to dull the mind. 
The warrior, concious of his need to get a solid night of rest before his all important bout, hesitates all of a minute before heading toward the room of his enchantress. Knocking tentatively and receiving no answer, he is about to depart when the door swings slowly inward of its own accord. Stepping within his eyes scan the room, widening as they note the discarded dress and nearly bursting from their sockets at the sight of lingerie likewise removed. The drip of water from the bathroom draws his attention and he approaches it cautiously, murmuring prayers under his breath. The front of his trousers tent painfully, and he fears that he may explode from anticipation.

Stepping within the smokey bathing chamber he is momentarily confused, eyes unable to adjust to the smoke and semi-darkness. Cautiously he steps within, sweat pouring down his neck from far more than just the heat of the bathing chamber. Unable to locate his temptress, he carefully makes his way to the bathing tub and glances down at the oily water. 

Kye, having waited below the surface for just this moment gracefully unfolds her long limbs and stands before him, utterly naked and dripping with water from every luxurious curve. His jaw drops, his mind reeling from the sight of the utterly flawless lycan beauty standing before him. His eyes dart about, attempting to take in the full breasts, pouty lips and poutier other lips all at once. She allows him but a moment of staring before she leaps into action. Her right hand curls around behind his neck and pulls him into her, their lips meeting in a passionate kiss that melts his resistance. Her left hand darts downward and weaves its way under his belt and onto his raging shaft, beginning to swiftly slide back and forth over its length with a skill he had not previously imagined possible. 

Utterly shocked and overwhelmed, the warrior offers no resistance as he is tipped forward, crashing atop Kye in the bathtub with her lips still locked on his and her hand still furiously pumping his raging erection. So talented is her ballet over his genitalia that he can do little more than moan into her mouth, panting with exhaustion already though the night has just begun. Wrapping her long, elegant legs around his waist, Kye prepares to alter the course of Stavennite politics

The warrior nearly drowns instantly, his hands far too busy exploring the divine body beneath him to bother with trivial matters like keeping his head above water. They slide over every inch of her flesh, causing even the experienced Kye to bite her lip with pleasure as they knead her breasts, thumbs passionately but inexpertly sliding around her aereola to tease her nipples near painful pressure. His hands explore downward, sliding over her silky thighs and over her legs, two probing fingers sliding inside her while his thumb mauls her clitoris. 

Kye screams in ecstasy, the young body above her arousing her even as his questing figures threaten to dominate her. Gritting her teeth, she forces herself to remember what is at stake and leans up whispers, \"I want something far more than fingers inside me, stud!\" The sex crazed, near stupefied young man obliges eagerly, withdrawing his fingers with a pop he leans upward slightly and allows Kye to guide him to her entrace. Mouthing a prayer to her Gods that she is up to the task of taking such a large cock, Kye closes her eyes and drives him into her with a clench of her powerful legs. 

For a moment, for both of them, the world seems to explode. Kye seems almost impossibly tight, her inner walls seeming to yield just the barest minimum required for entrance while pressing down with the force of a hundred nooses. Kye on the other hand screams as she feels herself almost torn apart by the well endowed and highly eager young warrior, his length and girth stretching her to the limit. She arches her back, pressing her large breasts into his face so that he is denied the sight of her screaming silently in unspeakable ecstasy. 

For what feels like an eternity, the mighty staff within her makes its way down her channel until the tip seems poised to penetrate her womb. Finally she hears the warrior groan, his cock having penetrated as far as it can go and now being subject to the near incomparable sensations of being massaged by Kye\'s inner muscles. With a sadistic grin he is far too distracted to see, Kye screams, \"Now fuck me like the stallion you are!\" directly into his ear. He needs little more urging, his arms seizing her firm, tight ass as he withdraws slightly only to pound into her once more, his cock driving into her like a battering ram, aided by his hands. Kye screams in escasty and commands him to do more, faster, and harder! 

He obliges, pumping into her faster and faster, each thrust seeming to uncover new, previously untouched nerves within her sensitive channel, driving her wild. Before long, the water coating his cock is replaced by Kye\'s liberally floating juices as each thrust seems to produce a mini-orgasm, her body rocking like a leaf under his hammer blows. Still, for all his size and strength, the warrior cannot long sustain the pace while keeping himself under control. With a howl of pure ecstasy he crashes down into the tub, his seed gushing forth in a torrent to fill Kye to the brim. 

Panting and utterly exhausted, he slumps down into the bath next to her, only to find that she is not nearly finished. Her hands slide over his newly limp cock and balls, a short massage in just the right spots driving him wild. Within seconds and before his shocked eyes, he stands erect once more. His cock seeming to quiver for Kye\'s touch once more...
What follows is a night the likes of which the warrior could not have imagined were he given a lifetime to fantacise. Kye\'s reportoire of tricks seems infinate, with a thousand different ways to get him hard once more always, and sometimes literally, on the tip of her tongue. Utterly insatiable, she pleasures him in every way imaginable, demanding to be taken from behind and in front and from a dozen angles. Patiently and thoroughly, she fulfills every one of his fantasies, always seeming to know just what he dreams of. 

...

In the morning, Kye slips out of the apartment, limping slightly but content that her work is done. Back in the bathtub, the warrior slumbers, utter exhaustion and several torn muscles ensuring that his sword would do little to alter the course of any battle for days, if not weeks to come.
