Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. This 
has been marked as holy ground. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A
delicate windchime hangs here, beautiful shells moving in the wind. An armoured
knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel before a
fierce lion. The shop directory of Antioch rests here on a marble pedestal. An 
icebox sits here. A small folding stool sits here awaiting a weary traveler. An
intricately carved muamrite guard's spear lies abandoned here. An elegant white
letter is in danger of being soiled here. An elite Antioch cleric is manning a 
cannon here. She has ninety cannon balls. A fierce sabretooth tiger prowls 
silently here. Eyes gleaming intelligently, a large silver-winged crow perches 
nearby, its wings aflutter in agitation. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a 
tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to 
the ground. A slope-backed hyena is barking racously nearby. Defiant in stance,
a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the surroundings with piercing 
eyes of ice blue. Eyeing you defiantly, a black sturdy mare trots here. You see
a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, and northwest.
