Cella urges Aleutia onwards.
<307/307h 327/391m 1248e 1856w <eb> <bd>> 15:19:55:948 >
You follow Aleutia to the up.
Within the top turret.
A wispy haired man looks out over the Valley, his staff in one hand and his 
other hand running through his beard thoughtfully.
You see a single exit leading down.
<307/307h 327/391m 1248e 1856w <eb> <bd>> 15:19:57:240 >
Aleutia leaps forwards onto Crevonix and mauls him viciously.
Aleutia has scored an awe inspiring hit to her target!!!
The final blow proves too much for Crevonix, who expires, pitifully.
||||TARGET DEAD||||
Crevonix exclaims, "Let's see who gets the last laugh!"
A golden band tumbles out of the corpse of Crevonix.
A large pile of sovereigns spills from the corpse.
<307/307h 327/391m 1248e 1856w <eb> <bd>> 15:19:57:531 >
(Ring): Aleutia says, "You have scored an awe inspiring hit to your target!!!
