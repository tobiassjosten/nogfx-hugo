silver couatl is coiled here. Dotting the ground around you with black and 
yellow, lay a massive number of dead bees. The remains of a mighty earth golem 
is here, though no more than a pile of gravel. A black ouroboros oscillates 
endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. There is a small pile of 
golden sovereigns here. A large beehive hangs down from the trees above. A 
swarm of bees hovers menacingly nearby. The undead form of Saligia Arvanian 
Kwindan is here. He is holding a tower shield in his left hand.
