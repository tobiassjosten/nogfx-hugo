Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
There are 2 beehives here. A flame-charred chariot pulled by demonic goats 
stands here. A glowing red flame-shaped sigil has been left here. Incredibly 
large and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with 
confidence and aloofness. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces
