A flourishing corner of the vineyard. (Rayatem Hills.)
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. A tall 
vineyard worker is here, sweat running down his brow. Brother Ike is here, 
giving off a truly ghastly stench. Erus Shukron, Ethereal Lich is riding on a 
sturdy Dardanic mare. He is holding a lunar shield in his left hand. 
Grandmistress Jasmina Askare is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench.
You see exits leading northeast, south, southwest, and west.

Climbing rolling hills. (Demon's Pass.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. A wild jackrabbit hops slowly about, eyes ever alert for danger.
You see exits leading north, east, south, southwest, and west.

A living vodun doll of Jasmina, its chest heaves a bit and its arms and legs 
move. Every detail of it is perfectly rendered, though the look in its eyes 
betrays no intelligence. It is a tool, not a fully living creature.
It has 50 months of usefulness left.
The doll has been fashioned 10 times.
The doll carries 91 illwill.
The doll carries 0 goodwill.
It weighs about 2 pounds.
It bears the distinctive mark of Haruspex Enteri Andarial.
There is a fist-shaped sigil firmly attached.
<340/340h 363/363m 1478e 1575w <-b> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
The terrifying form of Shukron, riding a sturdy Dardanic mare, Aspect of 
Sukhder enters from the southwest.
<340/340h 363/363m 1478e 1575w <-b> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
A wall of rough stone rises from the earth to block the exit to the southwest.
You have regained your mental equilibrium.

<340/340h 363/363m 1478e 1575w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
You put your mouth near the doll's ear, and whisper, very softly, "Die."
<340/340h 363/363m 1478e 1575w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Shukron utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
<340/340h 363/363m 1479e 1575w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
The eyes of the doll bulge and an instant later maggots begin burrowing up from
beneath the skin.
<340/340h 363/363m 1479e 1576w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Jasmina comes tumbling in from the southwest, and stops looking a bit dizzy.
<340/340h 363/363m 1479e 1576w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
The maggots quickly consume the doll, obliterating it completely as you let 
them fall to the ground.
Jasmina's screaming is muffled as she only succeeds only in coughing up the 
maggots that are consuming her from the inside out. In seconds she is dead, and
her body is completely eaten by the maggots.
You have slain Jasmina.
You have reached the illustrious pk level of 80 and your soul cries out in 
ecstasy at your new rank of Avasyuvian.
<340/340h 363/363m 1479e 1576w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 'tada

You say, "Tada."
<340/340h 363/363m 1480e 1576w <eb> <LL:0 RL:0 LA:0 RA:0> 
Shukron snickers softly to himself.

You pick up the corpse of Jasmina.
