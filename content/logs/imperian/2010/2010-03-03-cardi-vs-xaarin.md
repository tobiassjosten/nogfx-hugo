Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. The spring of
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass 
sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey
granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice.
A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A 
detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic 
features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering 
puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at 
the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning 
statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small sign 
points into a market stall. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over 
the Springs. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to 
have a vicious glint to its eyes. A black, murky mist has settled here. A black 
ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes.

Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, you bring your sabre crashing straight 
down on Xaarin's head. With a power that seems to come from on high, you cleave 
asunder his entire body, from head to groin, splitting him in two and killing 
him instantly.
You have slain Xaarin.
As Xaarin draws his final, dying breath, you hear him whisper the word, 
"Vengeance!". Suddenly, a spear of jagged bone materialises from thin air and 
plunges into your chest!
