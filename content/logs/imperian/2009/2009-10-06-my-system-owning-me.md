beastbane sketch
Aiming carefully, you thrust an iron glaive out at a nearly perfect sketch of a
young troll, disrupting the magickal energies that give it life.
The colour slowly fades out of a nearly perfect sketch of a young troll and it 
fades into nothingness, its delicate structure shattered by the tip of an iron 
glaive.

Kalon cuts off his emanation of a word of power.
A single pure note rings in your ears, growing louder and louder as you are 
overwhelmed with joy at the sound. Your ears begin to grow numb, and the 
numbness spreads over your face, down your neck, growing throughout your entire
body. Your soul slips free from its mortal coils, and you are treated to a 
sight of your own marble body, a fine skein of thin flame wreathing over your 
chest and imprinting a short passage on your statue.
You have been slain by Kalon. (Aff: dead)
A galingale flower falls out of your inventory.
A mandrake root falls out of your inventory.
Some hyssop stem falls out of your inventory.
