[Your rebounding is down];

Dias's chest, splitting it open as you do so. With an expert touch, you rip 
apart his innards, causing a maximum of horrifying pain, and, enjoying the 
spectacle of Dias writhing and screaming in agony, you rip out his sternum and 
drive it through his splayed body, pinning him to the ground to die.
