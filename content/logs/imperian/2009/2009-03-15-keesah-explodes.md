Posted for Ivarok:

About 10 minutes before this incident, I fought Keesah in Caanae, after seeing her there ungraced - she ran into Stavennite siege rather than dying to me. Andrea then submerged her (lol Andrea) and she said "I'M LOGGING OFF NOW" and quickly did so.

I sit at the Shuk, randomly type WHO and see her in Caanae - log starts at me honors'ing her, waiting for Grace to drop...

She is a mentor and able to take on proteges.
She walks with Divine Grace.
Her warcry is known to be, 'Welcome to your absolution!'
She is considered to be approximately 50% of your might.
She is an enemy of your council.

The Moon of Life suddenly appears in your vision, and you feel yourself being 
drawn towards the Lunar Plane.
A cheerful vestibule.
The length of this hall is decorated in silver and gold hues. The floor of the 
hall is crafted from a pale ivory marble that has golden veins running 
throughout and holds a reflection of all above it. On the walls, silver sconces
throw a dim light into the room, each holding a pale flame inside a small glass
globe. Silken golden drapes also line the walls at measured intervals, their 
tasseled edges barely sweeping the marble of the floor. Overhead, the ceiling 
begins to rise into a gentle slope until it is obscured completely by a soft 
haze that appears to be wispy, white clouds. In the very middle of the hallway 
is a small spring, which appears to run deep with cool water and allows a 
sapling to flourish within its center. An inviting leather sofa rests here. A 
massive groomed black stallion stands here proudly, its large form covered in 
silver battle armour.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southwest, west, and northwest.

Aryana's Spring. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
once grand market square of ancient Caanae surrounds this centralized point, 
where the ground has been shaken and torn apart by a catastrophic event. Three 
meticulously carved pillars embossed with runic scripts lie collapsed upon the 
ground. The remnants of a gold-trimmed roof lean askew to one side of the stone
pile, blocking the view from outside of all the wonders housed within this 
temple. Barely standing under the weight of a pillar is a marble altar, which 
has been etched with scars and scratches from the passage of time and elements.
The structure of the pillars silently displays how it was once a small but 
impressive temple; the inscriptions upon the altar indicate it to have been 
built in honor of Avasyu. Flowing freely from the cracks in the centre is a 
passage of pure water, perhaps the purest known in the realm of Aetherius. 
Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. There are 3 the shrunken head of 
Bronstals here. There are 2 desert foxes here. A well-carved statue of light 
grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A plain metal chest rests upon the ground here. Someone's preserved 
letter has been lost here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here 
depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. The 
shrunken head of Tekkor has been staked into the ground here, the last torments
of life still visible upon his face. A meticulous marble statue of a towering 
wlu
puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at
the base filled with offerings. The shrunken head of Aislygn has been staked 
into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon her face. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean 
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble 
foam about its mouth. The shrunken head of Sienna has been staked into the 
ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon her face. Standing 
upon a circular pedestal, this sculpture of a Kohdon woman radiates elegance. 
There are 2 the shrunken head of Mikhaels here. A small sign points into a 
market stall. The shrunken head of Andrea has been staked into the ground here,
the last torments of life still visible upon her face. A pike with the 
decapitated head of Dias has been erected. A shaggy grey mustang roams warily 
nearby. A young Norrjin stumbles about here in shock. A stray cat wanders 
around here, searching the ground for food. Keesah Dawnsong is here. She wields
a dwarven battleaxe in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

You concentrate on finding your memorised location, looking for familiar 
landmarks.

Andrea shakes her head sadly.
<581/581h 230/309m 2295e 1363w 0x <-bpp> <bd>> 
Andrea gives a sharp command to her wolf, which begins to sniff the air.
<581/581h 230/309m 2295e 1363w 0x <-bpp> <bd>> 
Sudden rememberance dawning upon you, you quickly move through the surrounding  (markreturn)
area to your memorised location.
A junction of Wendigo catwalk. (lost) (Ithaquan Council.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Inside the village, a 
broad and well maintained catwalk runs in a wide circle. The pathway stretches 
from limb to limb, reaching out to the east and west. Across a wide open 
expanse, the far side of the catwalk can be seen threaded through dense and 
foreboding growth. The branches of the huge pines here are rimed with frost, 
great icicles hanging from every thick limb like savage knives. A sign is 
carved into the thickest tree, marked with one word: "Wendigo." This has been 
marked as holy ground. His muzzle grey and hoary with age, an elder of the 
village crouches here casting bones. Bundled in fur and leather, an Ithaquan 
village woman stands here silently. There are 2 Ithaquan villagers here. His 
predatory eyes watching every movement, a wolfish hound stands here 
attentively. Sleeping soundly, Kabe the outrider lies here in blissful repose. 
Gliding silently, a grey Ithaquan kestrel scans the ground below for prey. 
Bright blue eyes gazing at her surroundings, an albino yearling stands 
impatiently here, occasionally swatting the air with an agile hoof. A small, 
snow-white fox slinks about the room. A Warden lancer is manning a cannon here.
He has sixty-nine cannon balls. A roan mustang is here, its long, full mane 
flowing freely in the wind. Leaning comfortably against a vicious-looking 
polearm, a Warden lancer stands nonetheless ready for battle. A banded stallion
stands here quietly regarding his surroundings. His supple form moving 
gracefully, a sinuous sorrel gelding is here. A bald eagle soars about on the 
thermal currents. A muscular mountain lion prowls here, searching for prey. 
Balanced easily on its oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is regarding 
its surroundings with its huge, blue eyes. A spirited Shaahri stallion trots 
about. You have entered the campground of Surakai. There are 7 charcoal cinders
in 7 groups here. A cloud of smoke fills the area, coming from a campfire in 
the center of a campground. Hivarius Arda'Tsian, Fury of the Black Wood is 
here. He wields a truesilver glaive in his left hand and a tower shield in his 
right. Typher Greyfang is here, camouflaged.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.
<581/581h 230/309m 2295e 1363w 0x <-bpp> <bd>> 
You have regained your mental equilibrium.
<581/581h 230/309m 2295e 1363w 0x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Typher tells you, "Lol i take it you don't like this person =P."
<581/581h 230/309m 2295e 1363w 0x <ebpp> <bd>> typher rofl
You tell Typher Greyfang, "Rofl."
<581/581h 230/309m 2295e 1363w 0x <ebpp> <bd>> typher The feeling's mutual!
You tell Typher Greyfang, "The feeling's mutual!"

Ivarok tells you, "Haha, noob." This is pretty blatantly OOC and I believe he 
should be punished for that.

I don't want to communicate with Ivarok at all. I've snubbed him and notified 
of my intention to snub him, but he continues to direct speech at me. This is 
bordering harassment
