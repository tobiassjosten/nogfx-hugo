Examined: Crafted from wood and painted to realistic proportions, this vial is in the shape of a human male's penis. The scrotum forms a base for the vial to rest on, and the main body of the vial itself is curved slightly. The glans acts as a cap, being able to be unscrewed to drink from when necessary."
