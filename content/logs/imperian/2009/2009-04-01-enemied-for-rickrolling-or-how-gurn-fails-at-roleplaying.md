Gurn moves in to engage you.

With a lightning-quick motion, Gurn slashes you with a dwarven battleaxe.
Your vision and hearing are suddenly restored.
Gurn viciously slashes you with a dwarven battleaxe!
A prickly, stinging sensation spreads through your body. 
 
Gurn gathers his breath and hurls a piercing battlecry towards you.
You fall to your knees and clutch your ears as the terrifying shaft of sound
shatters your will.

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.

You touch the tattoo and a shimmering translucent shield forms around you.

Gurn razes your translucent shield with a dwarven battleaxe.

Gurn viciously slashes you with a dwarven battleaxe!
The final blow is too much for you, and you fall to the floor a broken, bloody 
mess.
You have been slain by Gurn.

Your consciousness shifts, and you feel your body no more.

Gurn has declared you a formal enemy of the Council of Celidon.

Your limbs freeze and your body sprouts leaves as you turn into a small, but 
lovely, shrubbery.

Being a small shrubbery, you are able to do aught but perhaps rustle a bit.

You have recovered balance.
