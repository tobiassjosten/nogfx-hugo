- Mound within the ring of pine  -1:8:1 ---
A dryad is here. Her eyes beckon you with their inhuman beauty. A large 
fountain stands here, small waves crashing in the bowl of white stone. Standing here is a deep blue bookcase embellished with intricate carvings. A constructed ballista stands here. A large beehive hangs down from the trees above. You see a single exit leading south.
