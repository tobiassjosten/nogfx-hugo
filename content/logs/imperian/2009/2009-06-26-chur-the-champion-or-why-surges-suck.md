SECOND ATTEMPT:

Forge of the Lion. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A massive bazwolf paces the floor 
savagely, thick strands of foam hanging from its muzzle. Heated breath flaring 
his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A small package, 
wrapped in a grey cloth and tied with twine lies on the ground here. The 
hulking remains of Chur lie here in a huge puddle of thick blood. You see a 
sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading south and northwest (closed door).

Gathering your precious life essence, you close your eyes and concentrate. Your
mortal frame begins to shake as you slowly drain the smallest portion of your 
own life into the corpse of Chur, the Ogre Captain. The corpse of Chur, the
