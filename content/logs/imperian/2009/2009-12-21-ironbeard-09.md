ANNOUNCE NEWS #1413
Date: 12/18/2009 at 22:49
From: Dranor, God of Imagination
To  : Everyone
Subj: Ironbeard!

Everyone's favorite inebriated dwarf has returned to the Iron Realms for
the holidays, giving out presents galore.

Remember, you need to be online to receive a present from Ironbeard.
Every hour or so, he will choose some random people to give presents to
from amongst the online population of Imperian. You can only receive one
gift in a 24 hour period.

The gifts that Ironbeard will be distributing range from gold, vials,
and herbs to some low and medium priced artifacts.

Happy Holidays, and enjoy!
 
Penned by my hand on the 6th of Ultio, in the year 596 AD.

The rowdy notes of a drinking song, faint at first, then rising to the 
undisputed intensity of a Dwarf On A Mission, herald the arrival of Ironbeard 
the Magnanimous who casts his beam of a smile about himself as he arrives.
Bowing deeply, and a bit unstably, Ironbeard the Magnanimous pronounces his 
blessing, "A gift for Cardi. Oh yes!"
Ironbeard the Magnanimous just gave you a giftbag!

With a sudden look of concentration, Ironbeard the Magnanimous smiles a crooked
smile, rubs his ample stomach, and fades to nothingness, followed by the sound 
of a distant belch.

Finest golden silk has been used to create this delightful giftbag, woven 
tightly together with intricate whirls and circles that seem to ripple across 
the fabric almost of their own accord as it sparkles when catching the light. 
In a neat, criss-cross pattern, silver ribbon is laid over it, wrapping around 
the neck of the bag itself and ending in an intricate bow. A single golden bell
rests just below the bow, tinkling merrily when moved and giving a further 
festive, celebratory feel to bag.
It has 1 months of usefulness left.
It weighs about 22 pounds.
A festive sparkling giftbag is holding:
Nothing.
