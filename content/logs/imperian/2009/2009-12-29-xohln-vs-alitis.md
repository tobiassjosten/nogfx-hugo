A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance 
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking 
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of 
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena 
walls to the southwest. Hovering in the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic 
colours reflected in its wings. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up 
from the ground. The undead form of Lord Alitis Valstivar, Harbinger of 
Catastrophe is here. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a tower 
shield in his right.
You see exits leading east, south, southwest, and northwest.
