IC resolution to this other
 than to tell Alitis he fails, so I fail to see how this constitutes being worthy of an issue. Additionally, 

Alitis received word that 
anti-magickers were trespassing in Kinsmarian territory and sought to punish them for this, just as an 

Antiochian would likewise punish
 a Kinsmarian bashing party for trespassing in their territory. Regardless I must emphasize the utter lack 

of attempt at IC resolution.
 Finally, Zephurus did not die, and as per HELP USINGISSUES, filing an issue on behalf of another is against 

the rules.
