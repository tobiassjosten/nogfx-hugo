A wide, deserted road. (ruins of Caanae.)
Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. A rune circle has 
been sketched into the ground here. A brown and white dog romps around 
playfully, wagging his tail and searching for bones.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and west.

The empty northern square. (ruins of Caanae.)
Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. The emptiness of 
the northern area of the square is accented by the few uprooted weeds tumbling 
in the wind over the hard ground. A few shards of rotten wood that may have 
once been the foundation of a merchant's stall are stuck between the stones in 
disarray. In the distance, the fallen pillars that fence this giant square can 
be seen as well as a conspicuous cluster of rubble in the center of the square.
A large tent has been erected here, the faint scent of cinnamon issuing from 
within.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, south, southwest, and in.

The empty eastern square. (ruins of Caanae.)
Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. A lack of life and
luster characterized this portion of the eastern square, leaving behind only 
the weeds to thrive successfully, such as the ivy that clung to one of the 
broken statues. A few pieces of broken pottery can be heard cracking beneath 
your feet or seen reflecting the sun vaguely. Some patches of stone have been 
left unmarred by time and weather, allowing for a few choice spots to sit and 
contemplate the wide, empty area. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness.
You see exits leading east, southwest, west, and northwest.

The empty eastern square. (ruins of Caanae.)
Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. Incredibly large 
and a rare white shade, a massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence 
and aloofness. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. There are 35 
corpses of a carrion creeper here. There are 7 corpses of an ogre knight here. 
There are 3 corpses of an ogre bowman here. The hulking remains of Chur lie 
here in a huge puddle of thick blood. Huge body now a broken mess, an Ogre 
soldier lies here. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and 
alert. The undead form of Soul's Claw, Rayyn Andarial is here. She wields an 
iron-tipped whip in her left hand and a needle-pointed dirk in her right. Sapp 
De'Linguilette is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields a strong broadsword 
in his left hand and a buckler in his right. The undead form of Imperator 
Sagron Savet is here. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a ghoulish 
sabre of sharpened bone in his right.
You see exits leading east, southwest, west, and northwest.
