Issue #95710   Reported by: Ruga    Re: Drongon 2009-09-17 07:53:26: He has no pk rights on me. Even when he broke into my house and killed me he had no pk rights, and so he comes and attacks e and obviously he is so bad he has to call for his buddies who also team me and kill me once again, this is starting to frustrate me, please tell this BOY to stop goin around thinking he has cause on everyone when obviously he has not a clue to what the hell is going on much less THINKING he has cause on me which he doesn't. It would tickle me to death if someone could figure out why he is attacking me, it has been several other reports that has come to my attention about him killing people without cause. This is very aggrovating that i work hard for what i do, and the experience i gain to all be screwed up by drongon, and his friends, i ALWAYS fight alone and here comes 3 or 4 of them to kill me. I would gladly duel EVERY single one of them solo, but i really want to know why he is still attacking me."he came into my home and started attacking when i had never talked to him before nor seen him. So something needs to be done about this nonsense
