Issue #94628   Reported by: Ahkan    Re: Siath
2009-01-15 08:28:10: 
I've dealt with Siath and his player before.  He was fond of attacking 
'magickers' to run them out of bashing areas he wanted, but were otherwise 
occupied. It seems as if he's bored of bashing and freeforalls and is back to fabricating reasons to attack me. Earlier this evening I was jumped by a team of Stavennite characters and fled into the Heartland/Greytrem area and was set upon by Song and Aidan. The latter, is a person I have never met. Soon after the fight degenerated into a delightful team skirmish between 
Kira/Andun/Hebi/Song/Aidan vs myself/Nanten/Insinyan and later Jaskis/Zarok. A name you'll notice missing here is Siath. This could be because he was afk, in the arena or too scared that he would die in a team fight. An hour or so after the conflict, Siath attacks me without warning. His reason was 'you fought in a team fight with Kinsarmar against Antioch." Siath had ample time to attack during the team-skirmish, ample time to counter-attack with the group five minutes after and sixty minutes after when they were roving through the Aori Bay. The fact he is acting alone and not in tandem with his 'allies' only goes to show that his motivation is not the team battle and more his boredom and desire to pick on someone else. Were his player to want to play with everyone else? He should start joining the 'real' conflicts and stop fabricating his own to attack people over level 90.
