On a crumbling pillar. (road). (Northwest Arena.)
Audible sounds of quacking reverberate from a wood duck here. A dark crow perches nearby, glaring at your every move. Gazing serenely from its perch, a graceful gyrfalcon surveys the area. Pale eyes shining, a spotted lynx paces here restlessly. Eyes alert and claws at the ready, a fierce wolverine stands his ground. An elusive snow leopard prowls the area, eyes roving with a sullen glare.
You see exits leading east and down.
Your movement causes your translucent shield to dissipate.

Your bandages staunch a good portion of your bleeding.
Your wounds cause you to bleed 4 health.
You touch the tentacle tattoo and suddenly the ground splits open as a nightmarish tentacle shoots skywards, dragging Aakrin back to earth.
Aakrin falls from above, landing with a sickening crunch.

Aakrin yelps in pain as a spotted lynx bashes him.
The acrobatic stunts of a graceful gyrfalcon bedazzle Aakrin.

On a crumbling pillar. (road). (Northwest Arena.)
This narrow pillar is the highest point for miles around, and a vision of the entire ruined arena is laid out before you. To the southwest, you see the deep depression caused by the minor earthquake that collapsed that portion of the arena. Underneath you, and slightly to the southeast, the arena has been reclaimed by the forest, while further to the southeast the ruined arches of the great arena proclaim the entrance to the arena grounds. Audible sounds of quacking reverberate from a wood duck here. A dark crow perches nearby, glaring at your every move. Gazing serenely from its perch, a graceful gyrfalcon  surveys the area. Pale eyes shining, a spotted lynx paces here restlessly. Eyes alert and claws at the ready, a fierce wolverine stands his ground. An elusive snow leopard prowls the area, eyes roving with a sullen glare. Ser Aakrin Krax'ai is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields a kohdon spine battlebow in his hands. Dedicated Sadie, Adherent of Charity is here.
You see exits leading east and down.
