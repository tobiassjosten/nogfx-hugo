Nearing a ruined square. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A rune
circle has been sketched into the ground here. A brown and white dog romps 
around playfully, wagging his tail and searching for bones. A young Sidhe boy 
meanders about thoughtfully. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a massive
woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness.
You see exits leading north, east, and west.

He is followed by a demon resembling a large spider, a fearless Shaahri

slain and left here to rot. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked
and alert. Standing with arms crossed, a demonic minion scrutinizes its

Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A rune like a 
lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved statue of light grey 
granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with 
demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a 
towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large 
jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A 
stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. Standing
upon a circular pedestal, this sculpture of a Kohdon woman radiates elegance. A
small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft 
light. There are 3 thin silver rings here. A small sign points into a market 
stall. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. A pike 
with the decapitated head of Laerten has been erected. The towering presence of
Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate the room here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
