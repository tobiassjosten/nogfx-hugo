Issue #96082   Reported by: Andrea    Re: Iluv 2009-12-22 18:18:53:  
Circumventing snub...he worked hard to get himself snubbed and jus sends me letters now that I finally snubbed him.

Replyissue 96082 If the purpose of snubbing is to cease all 
communication or activity with the snubbed person then mailing letters to 
someone who has snubbed you is a bug in the game. Also if the purpose is to 
cease all communication or activity with the snubbed, and if that is the 
intention of the person who snubbed me, she should not continue to attack me 
without reason. I mailed her a single letter to kindly ask her to stop 
attacking me. 
You post your response to issue #96082. Thank you."
