Elegant, yet deadly, this weapon is forged with the finest burnished silver and meticulously polished. Simplistically designed, this flintlock shows little scrollwork or additional design to detract from the natural beauty of its original craftsmanship. You realize its slightly modified loading chamber as well as its precise design sets this apart from ordinary flintlocks.
It weighs about 10 pounds.
It bears the distinctive mark of Mr. Iluv Devilen, the Low End Theory.
