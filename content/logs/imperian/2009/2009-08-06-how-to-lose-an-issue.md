(Market): Katsuma says, "Issue siath using mind command to force tumble then 
braziering into guards 10 mins after I log on = Ilegal and a rather typical 
tactic of this maggot.... Sirah protest, and encourage you to pick your courage
up from whereever it has fled too" I also appeal to the admin because, while 
used to shit like this from Siath, at this point I feel like slapping him in 
his ugly face, because well...... simply put he's a puta with I believe a 
complex about his penis size."
