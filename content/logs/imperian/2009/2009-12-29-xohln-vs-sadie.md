Rubble-filled woodlands. (Northwest Arena.)
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. Hovering 
in the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. 
There are 3 throwing axes here. Incredibly large and a rare white shade, a 
massive woolly mammoth stands here with confidence and aloofness. A peaceful 
aura fills the area, emanating from Azyel, Aspect of Aryana. He is holding a 
small oaken drum in his left hand. Sadie Wyrdim is here. She wields a tower 
shield in her left hand and a living vodun doll of Xohln in her right.
You see a single exit leading northwest.
