You have emoted: Miana ducks her head just slightly as she continues through the crumbling chamber, finally coming to a stop at a large stone altar. She dismounts her horse, urging him to move away from the altar and towards a more secluded area of the cavern.

Stone altar. (Reate Forest.)
Covered with mosses and encrusted with lichens, an altar of chiseled granite has been placed here. Its proportions are huge, making it impossible that it was added after the construction, as the entire mound would have to have been built atop it. Scattered about in disarray are many rotted baskets woven from bark and grass, some still containing dried and rotted food offerings made to the dead buried within the barrow. Small, blackened depressions in the altar mark places where tobacco was burned in sacred rituals to cleanse the spirit and honor the ancestors who had gone before. 

You have emoted: Miana quickly mutters something to herself, eyes quickly looking to the left and then right with mild paranoia.

You have emoted: Miana with a decisive look, she strolls towards the southeast, hefting her bag of ritual items on her shoulder.

Painted cavern. (Reate Forest.)
A mural of fantastic proportions has been painted to the walls of this oval chamber. Dressed stone, obviously of much better quality than that used in the rest of the barrow makes up the walls of this sacred room. The wood supports that hold the ceiling up have been carved in fantastic designs of hunting cats, antelope, rabbits and hawks. Hunting scenes predominate the mural, showing primitive tribesmen attacking and bringing down large game using deadfall pits and cliff traps. Predominant throughout seems to be the depiction of a snow-white leopard, ghostly and surreal. A large black cauldron hangs above the remains of an old fire.

You have emoted: Miana carefully removes the salt from her pouch and begins sprinkling it in a large circle. Once the circle is complete, she crosses through it horizontally and vertically, separating it into four spaces.

Painted cavern. (Reate Forest.)
A large black cauldron hangs above the remains of an old fire. A black centipede with a shiny carapace scuttles quietly across the floor of the cavern here. A handful of white salt has been scattered here.

You have emoted: Miana continues to remove smaller items from her pouch, which includes four candles and four crystals.

You have emoted: MianaA gentle, almost eerie whistling escapes Miana's lips as she begins to place each item with intense care. The melodic sound echoes through the cavern, twinged with a sound of disharmony as the tones fall back onto each other in discord.

Painted cavern. (Reate Forest.)
A large black cauldron hangs above the remains of an old fire. A handful of white salt has been scattered here. There are 4 black pillar candles here. A small green crystal has been dropped here. A small red crystal has been dropped here. A small white crystal has been dropped here. A small blue crystal has been dropped here.

You have emoted: Miana murmurs something quietly to herself as she takes a quick look at her progress. The four black pillar candles have been placed at each vertex within the circle's line, while each crystal has been placed into its own separate section of the divided circle.

You mutter, "Green for e..... red f.. .ir.. white for air, b..e fo. ...ter."

You have emoted: Miana quickly removes a vial of ritual water and a dried out tongue from her pouch, setting the tongue in the direct center of the ritual circle.

A small red crystal has been dropped here. A small white crystal has been dropped here. A small blue crystal has been dropped here. A dried out tongue lies here, collecting dirt.

You empty out a glass vial of ritual water on top of a dried out tongue, covering it in water.

You have emoted: Miana pours the entire vial onto the dismembered flesh, which seems to begin to pulse once again with life. Kneeling, Miana scoops a small handful of moist dirt into her hand. With a chant barely above a whisper, she throws the dirt on top of the tongue before stepping outside of the circle.

You have emoted: Miana draws a ritual dagger from her pack, kneeling beside the salt circle with the corpse of a young deer on the ground. With ease, she slits the throat of the still-warm animal, painting her hands in its blood. Hands still red, she steps back into the circle once more, picking up each candle to light it while leaving a bloodied handprint around the object.

A young deer lies dead here, alert no more.

You have emoted: Miana stops in the quadrant containing the blue crystal, her eyes flickering to a darker shade of green as she begins to chant.

You chant, "A airts unto."

You have emoted: Miana moves to the next quadrant, containing the green crystal and continues to chant.

You chant, "I semis tcyi. I semis tcyi."

You have emoted: As she proceeds to the quadrant containing the red crystal, her words grow louder and louder, still repeating the words from the previous chants.

You chant, "A cantle forge. A cantle forge. A cantle forge."

You have emoted: At last reaching the final quadrant containing the white crystal, her voice has become a shouting chant.

You yell, "A eths storper! A eths storper! A eths storper!"

You have emoted: With the intensity of her words filling the room and the air tightening and suffocating, she draws her tinderbox, striking near the salt, which causes it to combust, creating a ring of fire surrounding her. Her body slowly begins to twist and contort until her form is a living pillar of flame within the burning circle.

Drawing upon your link to the fire plane, you concentrate your mental energy on reforming your physical being into that of the form of Flagrais.

Your transformation is complete; your body is a living flame, with only your will preventing the fire from igniting the world around you.

You have emoted: While maintaining her flagrais form, she bows her head in deep concentration as she calls upon the powers of the Crystal of Ages. With a push of will, Miana summons forth a vibration into the ethereal current.

Calling upon the Master Crystal, you focus the vibrations into the air about you.

As the tremors vibration embeds itself, a low rumbling can be heard.

You have emoted: The earth surrounding her begins to tremor violently. The candles and the fire immediately snuff out, as well as Miana's flagrais form. The cavern falls into complete darkness. Silence fills the painted cavern before a sing-song voice escapes the shadows. "It's done. It's done! Here we are, we're on our way!".

You have emoted: Light begins to flicker back into the cavern, all the items used in the ritual swept away by an unknown force and leaving nothing behind. Miana tilts her head from one side to the other, the joints of her neck cracking loudly. "It is done," she says, her voice dark and edged with a wicked tone.
