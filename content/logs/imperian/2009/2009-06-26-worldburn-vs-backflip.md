The arrow punches a hole through Adanedhel's shield, and it falls to the ground
in ethereal shards.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, 
tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the 
stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved 
statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a 
pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist 
lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting 
a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble 
statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, 
the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved 
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his
heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth.
Standing upon a circular pedestal, this sculpture of a Kohdon woman radiates 
elegance. A dagger of the sharpest metal lies like a shadow. A small oil lamp 
made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. Discarded 
by its owner, a fine rolled scroll lays here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, 
his gaze cast over the Springs. The decapitated head of Maharishi has been 
carelessly tossed aside. A red and black striped centipede scurries along the 
ground. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A stray 
cat wanders around here, searching the ground for food.
