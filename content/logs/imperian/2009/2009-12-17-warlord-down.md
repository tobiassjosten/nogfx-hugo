A beatific look of bliss appears on Juganothion's face as his ears begin to 
harden and turn to pure marble. The marble quickly spreads over his face and 
down his neck, turning his entire form white. After his entire body has been 
completely transformed, a fine skein of thin flame wreathes over the chest of 
the statue, imprinting a short passage onto it.
(((YOU HAVE SLAIN Juganothion.)))
You have slain Juganothion.
