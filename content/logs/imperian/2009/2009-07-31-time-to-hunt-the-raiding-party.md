You launch yourself into the air at Victor.
A twisting highway in the valley. (road).
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. A rune like 
a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A carved stone bowl 
rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. A sleek 
black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. The undead form of Sir 
Victor Farrell is here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each hand.
You see exits leading north and west.
Your foot slams into Victor, knocking him off his feet.
