Sarlia leans softly back into the warmth of your body. Her eyes seeming to 
close a little as she breathes lightly, clearly excited by the situation as she
turns on her heel to face you. Her kisses brushing your lips tenderly as they 
caress your own. Sliding tighter into your form. Her hands resting round the 
back of your hips as she smiles radiantly and locks eyes with you. Grabbing 
hold of your arse playfully as a mischevious grin flutters on her face. Her 
nails tracing your lower spine as she tilts her head curiously and then ups the
tempo of her kisses urging you onwards with every break and fall of them.

Marckarius Varolari presses eagerly into your kiss, his hands curling around 
your back as his tongue pushes against your own. Grinning against your lips he 
begins to suckle passionately on your tongue before hooking his hands around 
the backs of your thighs. "Hmm how about you just come up here." Lifting your 
thin body easily into the air he drapes your legs around his waist, grinning a 
bit wider he cups your ass in his hands and begins to stroke softly.
<400/400h 460/460m 1717e 1888w 38x <ebpp>> 
Sarlia sucks slowly on your lips as though surprised a little by the impact of 
it all. Her beautiful blue eyes watching you closely as she nudges harder and 
then pulls as she slides her tongue on your own. Seeming lost in the moment as 
you suddenly lift her up she gives a short surprised cry of delight and then 
wraps her long legs around your body. Her hips resting just at your groin area 
as she begins to grind upwards, capturing a kiss as she falls and rocks against
you. Her naked body tightly hugging your own as she slides a soft thigh down 
your side, caressing your skin as she rubs you up and down. Her smiles turning 
more delighted as she settles into the position and nuzzles your neck, her 
tongue flickering with each path as she remains locked onto your body and 
kisses across your collarbone with a lingering tongue.
