Before the Paran mountains. (Shaahri desert.)
You stand in the unrelenting bleakness of the southern Shaahri desert a 
landscape of hard stone upon stone in which little survives and naught 
flourishes. To the south and east the mountains rise suddenly and spectacularly
from the ground as sheer impenetrable and seemingly insurmountable cliffs, 
forming a vast and jagged ring which ensconces you in its compass. To the west 
you are just able to see, barely visible past the tip of the mountains base, an
area of gently rolling foothills far in the distance which appear to be 
carpeted in a soft and comparatively lush area of grassland, though this you 
conclude could well be wishful thinking. The only other way to travel out of 
this region appears to be along a route north taking you through the arid 
central desert, traversing across its undulating sand dunes, even this prospect
seems more inviting than dwelling in this hostile environment a moment longer. 
You see exits leading northeast, east, south, and northwest.
