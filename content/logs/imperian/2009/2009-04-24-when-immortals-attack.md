You enter a fiery portal.
Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. Waving ominously, a black
flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles listlessly in the wind. An 
ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally decorated pedestal here. The 
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, 
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. A black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold, at full 
mast upon a narrow pole has been implanted here. There are 27 Diavlous Knights 
here. A Kenuba hippopotamus stands here, massive jaws agape. A black 
star-shaped vial has been left here. A small black cobra is flaring its hood 
here. There are 2 powerful buckskin stallions here. A magnificent flag, 
emblazoned with the crest of the Empire ripples regally from the columns of the
gates. There are 2 armoured battle stallions here. A bench made from old, 
overly used weapons and armour has been placed here. There are 16 elegantly 
dressed Noctusaris here. An elegantly dressed Noctusari is manning a cannon 
here. He has fifty-seven cannon balls. A short, stone basin rests upon a 
pedestal here filled with blood. A tengu hovers gently over the ground here. A 
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Mangled and 
bloodied fur is all that remains of a small red-backed vole. Balanced easily on
its oversized hind paws, a Frost Behemoth cub is regarding its surroundings 
with its huge, blue eyes. Floating in the air is a fiery portal. Saryum is 
sitting on a bench of old weapons and armour. Felreign Trez Blackmoor, the 
Brute of Blackthorne is riding on a black ouroboros. He is holding a tower 
shield in his right hand. Soul's Claw, Rayyn Andarial is riding on a black 
ouroboros. She wields a Sukhder daegger in her left hand and a tower shield in 
her right. The undead form of Advisor Alaia Andarial, the Princess of 
Malevolence is here. She is holding a chain wrapped tower shield in her left 
hand.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east 
(gate open).

Imperial Parade nearing the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A rune
circle has been sketched into the ground here. A large, gold flecked hawk 
hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the light. The 
undead remains of a fearsome lion is here. Smoky tendrils constantly twisting 
and weaving around a towering demon statue, a shadow servant is here. A kohdon 
scout stands here eyeing his surroundings with an impassionated stare. The 
mighty war gong of Stavenn looms here, hanging between two pillars of fused 
bone. The visage of a horrific demon carved in bloodstone rises up from a base 
of skulls and stone. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at 
you with its many eyes. Anointed with blood, a heinous demonic jackal crouches 
here baring gleaming teeth. A slow oozing of blood runs the length of this 
black cross. The undead remains of a pallid stallion is here. A Diavlous Knight
is manning a bolt thrower here. He has ninety-five bolts. Advancing with teeth 
bared, the wolverine objects to the intrusion. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A sleek black hound stands stone still, 
ears perked and alert. An Imperial page is here, a small kit tucked securely 
under one arm. Lady Erana Vladin is here, shrouded.
