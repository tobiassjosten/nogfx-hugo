Issue #95797   Reported by: Bronstal    Re: Drongon
2009-10-06 09:45:50: 
Drongon is abusing his divinity powers. He enemied me to vahin and then used 
some attack from his god to by pass grace and kill me. This is clearly abuse 
and he should be punished for it. Or the thing should be changed so that it 
does not kill threw grace. As grace is protection from the gods against fools 
like this. \"Drongon slowly raises his hands towards the heavens, his face 
contorted in agony as the singular word \"Burn!\" crosses his lips. As the word 
is uttered, Drongon seems to shrink in stature as divine power rushes out of 
him and expels the power into the shrine. The air around you seems to freeze as a rumbling begins deep within your soul. Your soul burns as the divine power of Lord Vahin sears it.\" That is what he did i am not sure what it is called so i placed proof here.
