Antioch was founded some 300 years after The Awakening. Two years earlier, in
298 AA., a group of pacifist Stavennites, led by Ardor Baely Natan and Yarl
Din, grew quite uncomfortable with the aggressive stance of their City's
leaders in the conflict to the north. They began to gather people in homes at
night and talk to them about the need to change leadership. Stavenn had never
been ruled by majority opinion but they hoped that if enough people were
convinced that this might change. Over the course of a few months the number of
supporters grew.

The rulers of Stavenn found this to be nothing more than a small nuisance until
the 21st day of Tenebrae when Natan and Din organised a public gathering in the
center of Stavenn to make known the will of the people. Depending upon the
histories you read, either a tenth or nearly half of Stavenn was out in the
square that day. The Stavennite rulers declared a curfew and declared Natan and
Din enemies of the City. As the Stavenn army entered the square the crowd began
to scatter. They found that most exits had been barricaded by the army and as
they entered the rubble-filled alleys they were slaughtered. Natan and Din saw
what was happening and headed towards the open door of a shop Din owned. Din
opened the door and hurried Natan into the stock room. Just as he was about to
enter himself a Stavenn guard entered the shop and beheaded Din with his sword.
Din's body closed the stockroom door as it fell into the stockroom. The guards
tried to pry it open but a key sigil had been attached.

Natan could hear the guards above trying to break through the door and yelling
about fetching a mushroom sigil. He worked very fast and was able to dig
through the stockroom wall into the sewer system under the city. Once in the
sewer system he found that many others had similar ideas and were quite happy
to see that he was still alive but very saddened to learn of Din's fate. As
Natan worked his way through the sewers more and more people met up with him
and joined the group. By the time he reached a point where the sewers spilled
out into the river he was followed by some twelve dozen people. They waited
until nightfall then hurried out of the sewers and crossed the river.

1.9 CUSTOMER SERVICE

The method by which one obtains customer service in Imperian is via the ISSUE
command. By using this command, you report that you have an "issue" that needs
attending to. This should not be used for bugs or ideas (those should be filed
using the BUG or IDEA command).

The syntax to use the issue command is:

   ISSUE &lt;person&gt; &lt;a description of your issue&gt;.
     -or-
   ISSUE ME &lt;a description of your issue&gt;.

Note that an issue is always regarding someone, be it someone who is causing
your problem or a problem regarding only you. Once your issue is filed, a
message is sent to the other involved party (if there is one) requesting a
response from him or her. The administration will then see about solving your
problem as promptly as possible.

If you have an issue filed regarding you (by someone else), you will want to
reply and give your explanation of the issue. You may do so by typing:

   REPLYISSUE &lt;issue#&gt; &lt;your explanation&gt;

Note that when replying to an issue, you are talking to the administrators, not
to the person who filed the issue originally.

Please do not file spurious issues, such as "I was killed by Bob." You must
include details in your issue. Someone (generally an Administrator) will deal
with your issue as soon as He or She has time.

You may type ISSUES to see a list of issues you have filed that have not been
dealt with yet.

A summary of the issue related commands:

   ISSUE &lt;person&gt; &lt;text&gt;
   ISSUE ME &lt;text&gt;
      File an issue either regarding another player or yourself.

   REPLYISSUE &lt;issue#&gt; &lt;text&gt;

      List the pending issues that either you have filed or that have been
      filed regarding you.

   SHOWISSUE &lt;issue#&gt;
      Show the full text of the issue including any response.

   DELISSUE &lt;issue#&gt;
      If an issue has been already resolved, please delete it. Only the

1.9 CUSTOMER SERVICE

The method by which one obtains customer service in Imperian is via the ISSUE
command. By using this command, you report that you have an "issue" that needs
attending to. This should not be used for bugs or ideas (those should be filed
using the BUG or IDEA command).

The syntax to use the issue command is:

   ISSUE &lt;person&gt; &lt;a description of your issue&gt;.
     -or-
   ISSUE ME &lt;a description of your issue&gt;.

Note that an issue is always regarding someone, be it someone who is causing
your problem or a problem regarding only you. Once your issue is filed, a
message is sent to the other involved party (if there is one) requesting a
response from him or her. The administration will then see about solving your
problem as promptly as possible.

If you have an issue filed regarding you (by someone else), you will want to
reply and give your explanation of the issue. You may do so by typing:

   REPLYISSUE &lt;issue#&gt; &lt;your explanation&gt;

Note that when replying to an issue, you are talking to the administrators, not
to the person who filed the issue originally.

Please do not file spurious issues, such as "I was killed by Bob." You must
include details in your issue. Someone (generally an Administrator) will deal
with your issue as soon as He or She has time.

You may type ISSUES to see a list of issues you have filed that have not been
dealt with yet.

Issue #6339   Reported by: Dagobert    Re: Terri
2006-12-29 11:41:17: 
I do not believe Terri had reason to kill Dagobert at all. Terri had slayed 
Dagobert already for teaming him as he said it and I thought that was the end 
of that. I do not wish to have him harass me especially since there is no PK 
reason other than belonging to an organization, that of Antioch, which he is 
against
--[Reply]--
2006-12-29 11:48:02: 
You have died twice to Terri. First time was for the teaming you did against 
Terri 23/12, then you teamed Terri again sometime around 25 or 26, I dont 
remember exactly which day it was because I do fight alot. But it was in desert
close to Antioch, while Terri was trying to fight  Karack. And now you've died 
for that too. Simple as that.

1.9 CUSTOMER SERVICE

The method by which one obtains customer service in Imperian is via the ISSUE
command. By using this command, you report that you have an "issue" that needs
attending to. This should not be used for bugs or ideas (those should be filed
using the BUG or IDEA command).

The syntax to use the issue command is:

   ISSUE &lt;person&gt; &lt;a description of your issue&gt;.
     -or-
   ISSUE ME &lt;a description of your issue&gt;.

Note that an issue is always regarding someone, be it someone who is causing
your problem or a problem regarding only you. Once your issue is filed, a
message is sent to the other involved party (if there is one) requesting a
response from him or her. The administration will then see about solving your
problem as promptly as possible.

If you have an issue filed regarding you (by someone else), you will want to
reply and give your explanation of the issue. You may do so by typing:

   REPLYISSUE &lt;issue#&gt; &lt;your explanation&gt;

Note that when replying to an issue, you are talking to the administrators, not
to the person who filed the issue originally.

Please do not file spurious issues, such as "I was killed by Bob." You must
include details in your issue. Someone (generally an Administrator) will deal
with your issue as soon as He or She has time.

You may type ISSUES to see a list of issues you have filed that have not been
dealt with yet.

A summary of the issue related commands:

   ISSUE &lt;person&gt; &lt;text&gt;
   ISSUE ME &lt;text&gt;
      File an issue either regarding another player or yourself.

   REPLYISSUE &lt;issue#&gt; &lt;text&gt;
      File a response to an issue that was filed regarding you.

   ISSUES
      List the pending issues that either you have filed or that have been
      filed regarding you.

   SHOWISSUE &lt;issue#&gt;
      Show the full text of the issue including any response.

   DELISSUE &lt;issue#&gt;
      If an issue has been already resolved, please delete it. Only the
      person who filed the issue may do so.

Only the silkiest and smoothest of mink pelts have been used to stitch
together this sleek yet sturdy satchel. Two polished wolverine fangs
serve to button down the loose flap securely, keeping the satchel's
contents safe from falling out. The onyx fur gives off a faint gleam due
to the select oils that have been brushed into the mink's pelt,
preserving the wonderful quality of the fur.
It has 132 months of usefulness left.
It weighs about 3 pounds and 0 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Vega Verruil the Vulpine.

Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles 
listlessly in the wind. There are 10 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. The 
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, 
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. There are 20 Diavlous Knights here. A sigil in the shape 
of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A magnificent flag, 
emblazoned with the crest of the Empire ripples regally from the columns of the
gates. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large cream colored Graytrem
draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. His hard eyes watching 
everything, a Stavennite constable patrols here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a
cannon here. He has 290 cannon balls. A moldering scroll lies upon the ground. 
Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here 
impassively. Calmly gazing upon her surroundings with ice blue eyes, a healthy 
white mare stands here upon strong legs. An ancient and oversized tome stands 
upon a regally decorated pedestal here. The undead remains of a massive 
warhorse is here. The decapitated head of Hivarius has been carelessly tossed 
aside. There are 3 black ouroboros here. The undead remains of a red crested 
fantail is here. Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst is here, delirious. There are 2 small 
black cobras here. A full team of sturdy draft horses leads a huge caravan 
here. The shadowed form of Carmaine Nessaja, Ritual Heretic is here. He wields 
a tower shield in his left hand and a wicked-looking daegger in his right. 
Isadarr S'Sylistha, Lady of the Damned is here. She wields a wicked-looking 
daegger in her left hand. Trek Sar'Kien is here. He wields an iron-tipped whip 
in his left hand and a needle-pointed dirk in his right. Viperid Tsinghahla 
Iscariot is here. He wields a Tisnaag daegger in his left hand and a tower 
shield in his right. Acolyte of Darkness, Samishi is here. She is holding a 
miner's pick in her left hand.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east 
(gate open).

harassment. I tried to handle this in an IC manner he choose to snub and that 
is fine. I did the same. But I do not like the constant harassment and I ask 
something be done about it. He also has folks send me msges for him as well and
that is abuse of the snub system. I trust this will be handled accordingly

For once again, you came and attacked me while I was raiding Antioch. I went 
into the range of siege, rocks started firing. -You- tried summon, I left the 
area, you beckoned me into rites with your companion Kyntorian. I left, sat up 
traps, you and she enterd. And killed you both, you attacked me first... I've 
snubbed you because obivously, an intelligent conversation is impossible. If 
you attack me, how can you complain about me killing you, stop wasting my time.
And about having people sending you tells, I have no idea what your talking 
about, and would gladly know who and what those people where saying. Because I 
have no idea.
