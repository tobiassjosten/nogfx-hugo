Start of the Southern Highway. (road). (Western Nolmine Heights.)
It is raining heavily, pregnant drops of water pouring down onto you. Sheathed 
by a dark cloak and hat, a grim wytchhunter stands here silently, his hefty 
crossbow at the ready.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, west, and in.

&lt;290/241h 256/257m 1109e 1189w 72x &lt;ebpp&gt; &lt;bd&gt;&gt;

against an unseen force. His tension externalizes into sheets of lightning that
arc in a chaotic dance through and around his body.

Sycamore Coppice. (lost) (Western Celidon.?)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. You stand amid a tight
cluster of aged sycamore trees whose trunks have thrust into the sky for many a
year, and whose branches are now spread wide to catch the rays of the sun. 
Occasionally from the heights a seed pod spirals dizzily towards the ground 
alighting at you feet, drawing your attention to the numerous armoured beetles 
which roam like tiny tanks through the debris of the littered forest floor. A 
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. The decaying 
remains of Senshi lie here.
You see exits leading north and east.
