On a crumbling pillar. (road). (Northwest Arena.)
This narrow pillar is the highest point for miles around, and a vision of the 
entire ruined arena is laid out before you. To the southwest, you see the deep 
depression caused by the minor earthquake that collapsed that portion of the 
arena. Underneath you, and slightly to the southeast, the arena has been 
reclaimed by the forest, while further to the southeast the ruined arches of 
the great arena proclaim the entrance to the arena grounds. A small forest of 
sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. There are 2 scorching wall of 
fires here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Frostangel, Draven Bharathian, 
Relentless Vengeance is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a
tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading east and down.

staffcast dissolution at draven
You point an elemental staff at Draven, and a stream of bile-like acid streams 
out, covering him, who screams in agony.
What is your password? You have slain Draven.
Draven leaves to the ether.
Draven has left 'On a crumbling pillar'.
You look around triumphantly and realize you are the last one standing. You 
have WON the combat free-for-all.
