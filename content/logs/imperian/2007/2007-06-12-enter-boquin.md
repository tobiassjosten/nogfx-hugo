Upon an ominous floating platform. (lost)
A pentagram of gleaming blood hovers slightly above the platform here, its form
shrouded with swirling mists of eerie energies. Screaming warcries and seeking 
out new victims to slay, a swordslave stands here, the sword in her hand 
dripping with blood. A small globe of writhing worms hovers in the air, 
stinking of sulphur and rot. Diseased flesh hanging from twisted bones, a 
slachta demon squats gibbering in the corner, the very ground beneath its feet 
sickened by its touch. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is
on the ground. A crimson candle sits on the floor here, its wick flickering in 
the open air. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with 
its many eyes.
You see a single exit leading west (open door).

You say, "Now..."

You say, "Let's get that brain out."

You begin to wield a wicked-looking daegger in your left hand.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to a demonic minion, "Don't move."

You say, "I suggest ordering your other demons away, don't want them attacking 
me."

You see the following people here:
Lenoxi, Daren, Iluv, Isadarr, Alitis, Iluv
 (1)     (2)    (3)   (4)      (5)     (6)

You say, "I'd hate to have to kill ALL of them."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Yes would you open the door for me?"

Isadarr whispers something to Iluv.

Iluv chuckles long and heartily at Isadarr.

You open the door to the west.

Daren says, "Should I get rid of mine also?"

You say, "No, I just need Iluv's demonic minion..."

A pathfinder hums off to the west.
Iluv leaves to the west.

A swirling portal opens from the Demon Planes and spits out a demonic minion, 
then vanishes.

You stare at a demonic minion, giving him the evil eye.
Blood begins to flow from a demonic minion's pores.
A demonic minion is startled into wakefulness.
You stare at a demonic minion, giving him the evil eye.
Blood begins to flow from a demonic minion's pores.

You stare at a demonic minion, giving him the evil eye.
Blood begins to flow from a demonic minion's pores.
The final blow proves too much for a demonic minion, who expires, pitifully.
You have slain a demonic minion.
A demonic minion screams with rage as the ties that bind it to this plane are 
severed.
Nothing can be seen here by that name.

You close the door to the west.

You say, "Now, let's get that brain out."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "No one mourns the wicked."

Iluv arrives from the west.

You have emoted: Alitis moves over to the body of the minion and drives his 
daegger into the skull, using it to saw the top of it completely off, exposing 
the fleshy organ underneath.

Iluv peers at Iluv unscrupulously.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I've come to watch too."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Ooh."

Carefully, Alitis drives the daegger in between the skull and the organ itself,
prying it out of the cavity and causing it to plop on the floor.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Is that colour normal?"

Iluv points at Iluv and whispers, "Hush!"

You ask Iluv, "Would you mind being quiet, lest I decide to use your brain 
instead?"

Iluv cowers in a corner, whimpering.

Iluv gives you a nod of acknowledgement.

You say to Iluv, "Now... lie down for me."

Iluv sits down.

You say, "And somebody pick up that brain."

Sticky strands of webbing spray out to cover Iluv as you touch the web tattoo.

You say to Iluv, "You'll need this... trust me."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Anything else I'll need?"

You say, "Now, should any of you attempt this procedure, I suggest sticking 
your subject with Atropine... but given his reluctance, we'll be doing without 
painkillers."

You rub your hands together and grin evilly at Iluv.

You drop to one knee, demonstrating your humility and respect.

Daren picks up the brain and hands it to Alitis.

You say, "Hold onto it."

You say, "Just... sit on his legs for now or something."

You say, "Don't want him flailing about."

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

You say, "You know... we don't want him passing out either..."

Daren sits on Iluvs legs.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "We don't?"

Lenoxi says, "Hold his head I suppose?"

You say, "Never mind, it'll be easier if I use painkillers."

You rub some atropine on a wicked-looking daegger.

Lightning-quick, you stab Iluv with a wicked-looking daegger.

You ask Iluv, "Did it take?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Pinch me."

You lift your leg, thrusting it at Iluv.
You connect!

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "It's working."

You say, "Good."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I'm going to feel that later."

You say, "You'll feel alot later."

Iluv puts his hand to his forehead and swoons.

(SB): Iluv says, "Which is impossible."

(SB): Iluv says, "Because i'm all tied up."

(SB): Iluv says, "Heh."

(SB): You say, "We're saying that memory transplants are possible, I think that
what is possible and what isn't has been thrown out the window."

(SB): Iluv says, "Cool."

(SB): Iluv says, "I'll be able to have demon prince memories."

You have emoted: Alitis kneels down at Iluv's head, and shoves his daegger 
slightly into his forehead, and begins sawing carefully and slowly around the 
skull.

(SB): Iluv says, "Lol you injun."

You say, "Now, what we'll be doing is a complete transplant of the limbic 
system..."

You say, "Which is right near the brain stem, so if any of you do this, be sure
to be extra careful."

You say, "Lest you disable thier motor skills or, gods forbid, thier heart and 
lungs."

(Stavenn): Isadarr says, "Farewell Empire."

(SB): Iluv says, "You should accidently cut the hypothalamus and I'll begin to 
over eat and become massively obese."

As he explains the procedure, Alitis's daegger comes around the skull and 
finally back to the point where he started. He then proceeds to carefully 
remove the skull, exposing Iluv's brain.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Looks awfully small."

Iluv points at Iluv and whispers, "Hush!"

Isadarr is enveloped in translucent fire for a moment and is gone, her soul 
safe until she returns to Imperian.

You say, "My thoughts exactly."

You say, "Now, time to use a finer instrument..."

You cease wielding a wicked-looking daegger in your left hand.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Well it has always been my personal belief that
size does not matter."

You have emoted: Alitis takes up a scalpal in his left hand.

You ask, "Why do the small ones always say that?"

You see the following people here:
Daren, Lenoxi, Iluv, Alitis, Iluv
 (1)    (2)     (3)   (4)     (5)

You ask Daren, "Still have the minion's brain?"

Daren grins and nods.

Lenoxi grins mischievously at Daren.

Daren says, "Need it?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "What are you implying, good man?"

You say, "Yes actually."

Daren reluctantly hands the brain over to Alitis.

You say to Iluv, "Nothing at all... now hush before I jab some opium into your 
frontal lobe."

Lenoxi says, "What a trip that would be..."

Lenoxi stops and hushes herself, embarrassed.

You have emoted: Alitis takes up the demonic brain in his right hand and turns 
it upside-down, and begins carefully removing a small piece of it, between the 
brainstem and the cerebral cortex which makes up most of the brain.

You say, "Careful..."

Daren licks his lips.

Blinking away sweat from his eyes, Alitis finally removes the piece of the 
brain, and chucks the unused portion over the edge of the platform, leaving an 
intact, demonic lymbic system in his right hand.

You say, "Now... there should be enough room in that skull for me to just 
insert it into the brain, but if not... well I may have to carve out some 
bone."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Before the atropine wears off, preferably."

You ask, "If I cram some Mandrake into your mouth, will that get you to be 
quiet?"

Lenoxi eyes the remaining portion of the brain.

You have emoted: Alitis carefully lifts the brain up within its cavity, 
exposing the base of it without severing the brainstem. He then proceeds to 
carve open a small piece of the brain, where he intends to graft the demonic 
brain.

You say, "Sorry."

Iluv opens his eyes wide with shock.

You say, "I meant to do that."

Iluv mutters discontentedly.

Daren snickers softly to himself.

(SB): Iluv says, "Hah I was waiting a while to do that."

Lenoxi chuckles long and heartily.

Sweating profusely, Alitis closes his eyes to blink away the moisture, and 
shakes his head off a little. He looks back down at the skull and his eyes open
wide with terror.

You say, "Iluv... try to move..."

Iluv squirms uncomfortably.

You say, "Just your arm or a leg or something."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I can't, of course."

You say, "Fuck..."

You say, "Don't worry, I can fix it."

You have emoted: Alitis puts down the scalpal and uses a slight jolt of 
magickal energy to mend the wound, but frowns as he looks at the other damage 
he has done.

You say, "Got some bad news for you..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Spill it out."

You say, "I'm going to have to completely replace the lymbic system... you 
won't have the thoughts and personality of the demonic minion running alongside
your own, instead, you'll actually BE the minion, for all intents and 
purposes."

You say, "You'll of course, have all your old memories, but your personality 
will, theoretically, be completely altered."

You mutter, "50 mo.... and the one ...e I ..rew it up it'. .omebody us......."

(SB): Iluv says, "But this will be just temporary right?"

(SB): You say, "Frankly, you can do what you want with it."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "But this will be just temporary right?"

(SB): Iluv says, "Yeah."

You say, "I honestly don't know."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Well go on and do what you have to do."

You say, "I've never had this happen before... so however this effects you is 
completely unknown."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I just wish Vee was here."

You say, "We need to slow down the brain activity, I'm going to have to put you
to sleep."

You stare at Iluv, giving him the evil eye.
You stare at Iluv, giving him the evil eye.
Iluv's eyes close suddenly as he falls asleep.

Lenoxi steps down off of a black ouroboros.

Lenoxi sits down.

You have emoted: Alitis proceeds to carve open the same part on Iluv's brain 
that he did with the minion's, and carefully removes it from the brain while 
being extra cautious to not hit the brain stem.

You have emoted: Alitis takes the opportunity to wipe sweat from his brow, and 
proceeds to grab the working demonic lymbic system, and carefully inserts it 
into the hole at the base of Iluv's brain.

With a quick burst of necromantic magicks, Alitis seals the wound, forever 
melting together the demonic brain and the human brain.

You have emoted: Alitis replaces the brain back within the skull, grabs the 
removed skullcap, and using more magicks, welds the skull back in place.

You give a pained sigh.

You say, "It's done."

Beads of sweat break out on your face.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Fit for government work I suppose."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to you, "Bring me a towel."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I seem to be perspiring enormously."

Iluv stands up from the ground.

You have emoted: Alitis throws his scalpal at the irritating doppleganger, 
hitting him squarely in the eye.

Iluv brushes his hair aside.

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.

You say, "Oops."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to you, "And stop attacking my demonic 
companions."

You ask Iluv, "How are you feeling?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to you, "Thin and weakly."

You ask Iluv, "Do you remember your name, where you live?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Yes my name is Boquin."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Third Prince of the Decrepit Margins."

You say, "Wonderful... I made him insane..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to you, "Now are you going to bring me that towel
or are you going to stand around and pester me more with questions?"

You say to Iluv, "Here is a little something you should realize..."

(SB): Iluv says, "Lol."

You say to Iluv, "You are not Boquin, you're name is Iluv."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Why would I be named such a detestable and 
common name such as Iluv?"

You say to Iluv, "Boquin is dead, I implanted his personality, his memories, 
inside you."

You ask Iluv, "Don't you remember?"

Iluv looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Lenoxi's forked tongue flickers out briefly as she tests the air.

Iluv inspects himself, taking special attention to his skin.

You have emoted: Alitis uses the sleeve of his shirt to wipe the rest of the 
sweat from his brow.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Blast. I'm green."

You say to Iluv, "Look... I don't know how long before these dellusions will 
wear off, if they wear off, but you are not a demon... well, you are, sort 
of..."

You say to Iluv, "But that's beside the point. Your name is Iluv Devilen, you 
are a member of the proud city of Stavenn."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "You look, let me tell you something..."

Iluv begins moaning and clutching at his head.

You poke at Iluv.

Lenoxi takes a few steps back from Iluv.

You ask Iluv, "You alright?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, ".. yes."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I see."

You ask Iluv, "What is your name?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Which one?"

You say, "Well... he got what he wanted... two personalities in one mind..."

You say, "Only... instead of existing side by side... they conflict with 
eachother..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "This one is Master Iluv, I know for sure."

Iluv gives Iluv an acknowledging nod.

Lenoxi scratches her head in confusion.

You say, "Short version, he's pschizophrenic..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Hey mind you."

You say, "His demonic personality should provide with valuable insight into the
personalities and hierarchy of the demon world."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I'll tell you one thing."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "He's arrogant."

You say, "I can't wait for Isadarr to meet him..."

You give a mischievous grin.

Lenoxi snickers softly to herself.

Daren's eyes twinkle enchantingly.

Lenoxi says, "So Prince Boquin? which one is that?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "How should I go about explaining him?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Boquin, is that his name?"

Iluv chuckles long and heartily.

Lenoxi stumbles and falls as she faints into half-consciousness.

You say, "Yep... so you've got a dead demon living inside your brain."
 
Daren says, "First things, you should probably announce him when he comes into 
a room."

Lenoxi says, "Awesome..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Shh."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I can hear a whisper."

Lenoxi's eyes bug out as she boggles in amazement.

You ponder Iluv's profile, wondering if it would make a suitable subject for a 
portrait.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Ah yes I can hear him now."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Oh."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to you, "He wants me to thank you for your 
wonderful job."

You ask, "Can you communicate with him?"

Lenoxi says, "Is that a good oh, or a bad oh?"

Comprehension flashes across Lenoxi's face.

You ask Iluv, "OK, so he's finally figured it out eh?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to you, "He said it was good enough for 
government work."

"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.

You say, "That's the first thing he said when he came out of it."

Lenoxi snickers softly to herself.

You say, "So... let's get Boquin's corpse thrown into the pit."

Lenoxi says, "Can he hear us?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I suppose."

Comprehension flashes across Lenoxi's face.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "He's objecting to his corpse being thrown."

Lenoxi says, "He wants is to rot here?"
 
Daren says, "Eat it?"

Lenoxi gives Daren the once-over, eyeing him suspiciously.

You say, "Fine, then consider his body donated to science."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, ""I am and a Prince and as such my remains 
should be handled with the utmost care. You will have those simpletons gently 
move my body"."

You say, "Well... if he wishes to call me a simpleton..."

Daren licks his lips.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I actually changed that part to be a bit more."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Or less rude."

You have emoted: Alitis walks over to the minion's corpse, grabs it by the 
clothing, and heaves it over the edge of the platform, sending it tumbling into
the abyss.

Lenoxi says, "Ouch..."

"Awwwww!" Daren says.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "He's storming mad now."

You ask, "I never obeyed a dead demon before, why start now?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to you, "Is there anyway I can block him out?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Temporarily."

You say to Iluv, "To be honest... I know absolutely nothing."

Iluv jerks his spine and clutches his head once more.

You say to Iluv, "I've never actually done this before..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "How dare you!"

You begin to wield a wicked-looking daegger in your left hand.

You begin to wield a tower shield in your right hand.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Can you not follow specific instructions?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I guess not seeing as you botched up your last 
operation."

A shimmering translucent shield forms around Lenoxi.

You say to Iluv, "You will be reminded that I am a noble of the Imperium."

You say to Iluv, "And that you are just a dead demon, your kind are nothing 
more than tools to me."

You say to Iluv, "And I disposed of a used tool."

Lenoxi says, "I wonder if he joins him in Dis, the soul and body could 
reunite...Iluv would be rid of the bonding.."

Lenoxi says, "Just a suggestion..."

Daren ponders the situation.

Iluv peers at you unscrupulously.

You say to Iluv, "The only reason I haven't killed you yet is because that body
happens to belong to somebody I value as a friend."

Iluv bears his teeth and hisses in an unnatural tone.

You say to Iluv, "However, I can be persuaded to forget that..."

Iluv faces down.

You say to Iluv, "Now, let me know when you've accepted your place, so you can 
teach us how to use the better tools."

Iluv lifts his head up, his manner of expression changed.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "He can tell you through me."

You cease wielding a tower shield in your right hand.

You cease wielding a wicked-looking daegger in your left hand.

You say, "Good..."

Lenoxi says, "Which is who again...."

Lenoxi scratches her head in confusion.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "The Dead Ringer."

(SB): You say, "Man... this is so awesome, I need to message Thanatos to see if
we can get an event going around this."

Iluv curves his lips upward in an eerie smile.

(SB): Iluv says, "Hehee this is the most fun I've had in a long time."

"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

You say, "Do me a favour..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Yes yes?"

You say, "If you ever come across Reznok, let Boquin take control for five 
minutes."

You say, "And let me know how the Warlord reacts."

You give a mischievous grin.

(Stavenn): Reznok says, "I will be a leading a hunting trip, starting from the 
gates. Anyone interested in joining, leave your ring if you aren't in mine, and
follow me. We'll be leaving soon."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I'm not sure what to expect from that."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "But I'd be happy to if you were there to 
explain the situation."

You beckon to Iluv.

Iluv begins to follow you.

You say, "Well, then let's go."

Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. Waving ominously, a black
flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles listlessly in the wind. The 
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, 
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. Firmly supported by its blackened steel frame, an 
unusually worn ebony hammock hangs here. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with 
the crest of the Empire ripples regally from the columns of the gates. There 
are 2 monolith sigils here. An ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally
decorated pedestal here. The undead remains of a massive warhorse is here. The 
shrunken head of Galail has been staked into the ground here, the last torments
of life still visible upon his face. There are 2 the shrunken head of Ozreas 
here. The shrunken head of Rhana has been staked into the ground here, the last
torments of life still visible upon her face. A small package, wrapped in a 
grey cloth and tied with twine lies on the ground here. Conversing with passing
citizens, a young guard nevertheless manages to look watchful. A few small 
pieces spilling out, a bag of bread crumbs lies here. A sleek black hound 
stands stone still, ears perked and alert. There are 2 small black cobras here.
There are 2 glittering blood red masks here. A pathfinder bobs about in a 
circle, flexing its long wiry antennae. The undead form of Valena is here. She 
wields a needle-pointed dirk in her left hand. Rythen Argyle is here, hidden. 
He wields a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand and an iron-tipped whip in his
right. Esme Avrae is here. She is holding a tower shield in her left hand. 
Eponine Lokrien Savet is here, shrouded. Reznok Lokrien Savet, The Tormentor is
here, shrouded. He wields a sturdy shortsword in his left hand and a tower 
shield in his right. Reznok Lokrien Savet, The Tormentor is here.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east 
(gate open).

You whisper to Iluv, "Go for it."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Okay let me get him."

Lenoxi eyes close and her lips move silently as an Ouroboros rushes in.

Lenoxi climbs onto a black ouroboros.

Iluv faces downward and holds his head.

Eponine bows respectfully to Iluv.

You ask Reznok, "So... I was wondering, how do you think your demons feel about 

you?"

You ask Reznok, "In particular, your minion?"

Reznok Lokrien Savet, The Tormentor says to you, "It's irrelevant. I am the 
Master, they are not."

Iluv lifts his head, his expression undoubtedly changed.

You ask Iluv, "And what's your take on the situation?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "He may be the Master."

Reznok Lokrien Savet, The Tormentor says, "But if I had to take a guess, I 
would mise that they get alot of entertainment with all the slaughter they've 
helped with."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "But that does not mean he knows what he may be 
doing!"

You snicker softly to yourself.

You say to Iluv, "Continue... speak your mind..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I, Prince Boquin, of the Decrepit Margins have 
won more battles than he has in the like!"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I led my troops into the valleys against the 
Imp horde!"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I drowned legions in the Vistula."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "And with the blood of the enemy in my eyes, I 
formed a nation!"

A great weight seems to have been lifted from Reznok.

Reznok rubs some salve on his skin.

You snicker softly to yourself.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "But like many of my own men."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I was called into service."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "But unfortunately, and unlike my own men."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I was given to an simpering dolt."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to Reznok, "Not you mind you."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says to Reznok, "But I hardly believe you are any 
better."

Reznok shrugs helplessly.

Eponine Lokrien Savet says, "Me, a simpering dolt!"

You give a mischievous grin.

Eponine gives a trillingly melodic laugh.
 
Reznok Lokrien Savet, The Tormentor says, "I could always be like other people 
and stop doing anything at all."

You say to Reznok, "Well, there you have it, straight from the minion's mouth."

You say to Reznok, "Or at least... a minion's brain..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "You could learn a thing or two from me."

Reznok scratches his head in confusion.

Lenoxi grins mischievously at you.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Particularily how to raise morale within your 
troop."

Reznok Lokrien Savet, The Tormentor says, "I just want to kill more people."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "That's what a General Prince is for you see."

Eponine nods her head at Reznok, showing her acceptance.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Sure I've never slain anyone by hand, but if 
you count the men under men."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I've slain thousands."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Me I meant."

You say to Iluv, "Alright... Boquin, I think he got the message."

You say to Reznok, "And I hope you weren't referring to me by your comment, as 
I've been doing important research..."

Reznok Lokrien Savet, The Tormentor says, "No, I wasn't."

You say, "Good."

Iluv lowers his head and becomes silent.

Reznok Lokrien Savet, The Tormentor says, "I wasn't referring to anyone 
inparticular. Many people do as I described."

Iluv lifts his head with a toothy grin on his face.

You say, "I am a genious..."

Reznok utters a deep, rumbling laugh.

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Quite a fellow I suppose."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Funny how they never say these things when they
are under your pact."

Eponine gives Iluv an acknowledging nod.

You say, "Well, because he's a part of you now."

You say to Iluv, "Which, of course means you'll be held accountable for his 
actions."

"Mhmm," Iluv murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

Iluv nods his head.
 
Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I've contained him once before."

You say, "Still, I'm going to keep you under close observation, just in case."

You say, "And keep your guard up."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "If that's what you suggest."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "Do you suspect foul play?"

Lenoxi says, "This was enlightening..."

You shake your head.

You say, "This is one of those accidental discoveries, plain and simple."

Daren says, "Aren't those usually the best though?"

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "I'll keep in check."

(SB): Iluv says, "Heh that was neat."

You say, "But he no doubt realizes that through you, he has the power of demon 
lords at his command... which could be extremely dangerous with his 
knowledge..."

(SB): Iluv says, "Too bad isadarr left."

Daren says, "Well if he hadn't thought of it he knows now..."

Iluv Devilen, the Wicked says, "He has limited control over my body."

(SB): You say, "I'll send her the log."

(SB): Iluv says, "You could post it on nogfx if you'd like."

(SB): You say, "Yah, I just need to clean it up a bit."
