Before a hillock. (Graytrem hills.?)
It is raining heavily, pregnant drops of water pouring down onto you. This hill
is little more than a gentle rise, thickly covered in a lush blanket of wild 
grasses, which soften its contours still further. The hills crest is shaped 
like a small seat, with a shallow dip in its tip little larger than a mans 
width. It offers a comfortable idyll in the midst of tumultuously undulating 
lands all around. There are 2 Seraphic guardians here. Bright blue eyes gazing 
at her surroundings, an albino yearling stands impatiently here, occasionally 
swatting the air with an agile hoof. Aprus Agarwaen Starfire is here. He wields
a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right. Ignitis of 
Ki, Draven Amherst, The Blessed Guide is here. He wields a flintlock in each 
hand.
You see exits leading northeast, south, and west.
Your holy seraph informs you that she senses Kephas Bezaliel is in this room.
