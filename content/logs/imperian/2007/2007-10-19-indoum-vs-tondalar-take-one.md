Standing in a large chamber. (Chorsha Underground.)
Boinar, a stocky dwarven miner rests here.
You see a single exit leading east.

H:284 M:319 E:1250 W:1541 <eb> 'now, what did you want?
You say, in Hanyou, "Now, what did you want?"
H:284 M:319 E:1250 W:1541 <eb> 
A strong arm encircles your chest and a sharp blade is pressed to your throat 
as you are taken hostage by Tondalar.
H:284 M:319 E:1250 W:1541 <eb> 
You suddenly feel the bite of the blade as it moves across your throat, 
splitting flesh and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to choke you 
as the knife cuts through to your windpipe, but you can only sputter and scream
silently as you feel death in the immediate coldness of your limbs, and the 
dimming of your vision. Roughly, your attacker shoves you to the ground and you
turn in time to see Tondalar holding the bloodied weapon.
You have been slain by Tondalar.
You gasp with the realization that Tondalar has reached the level of Celestial.
