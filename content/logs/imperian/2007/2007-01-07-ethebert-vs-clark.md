Ethelbert yelps in pain as a shadow hound bashes him.
H:406 M:190 E:1916 W:996 &lt;eb&gt; 
Rolling hills south of the Dardanic grass.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A shaggy bull stands here, immovable 
as a boulder.
You see exits leading north and south.

You have recovered balance.
H:406 M:189 E:1913 W:997 &lt;eb&gt; South

Animal trail through the Vardarian Highlands.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A verdant green mist fills the area 
with life. A sphere of perfect, translucent crystal hangs in the air, a subtle 
song echoing around you as the turn of the year unfolds within its depths. 
Fangs dripping with what could only be fresh blood, a shadowy figure of a hound
stands here, his eyes roving with a calculated glare. A sleek and stealthy 
kestrel is perched here. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the
ground. Al'ro'Delian Lorccan d'Treune-Cridhe is here. He wields a tower shield 
in his left hand and a truesilver glaive in his right. Viscount Ethelbert 
Kulmyrric, Knight-Commander is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields a curved
sabre in his left hand.
You see exits leading north, west, and up.

You begin to wield a shining longsword in your right hand.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:996 &lt;eb&gt; 
You gather your breath and hurl a piercing battlecry towards Ethelbert.
Ethelbert falls to his knees and clutches his ears as the shaft of sound 
strikes him.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:996 &lt;-b&gt; 
The fuse on the arrow buried in Ethelbert's gut begins to burn low.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:997 &lt;-b&gt; 
A sleek and stealthy kestrel opens a gash in Ethelbert's arm with a skillful 
blow.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:997 &lt;-b&gt; 
You feel your density return to normal.

You quickly rub some salve on your skin.
Your body grows extremely dense and heavy as the mass salve infuses your skin.

Ethelbert yelps in pain as a shadow hound bashes him.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:997 &lt;-b&gt; 
Ethelbert takes a drink from a wooden vial.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:997 &lt;-b&gt; 
Ethelbert quickly eats a maidenhair leaf.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:997 &lt;-b&gt; 
Ethelbert crackles with blue energy that wreathes itself about his limbs.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:997 &lt;-b&gt; 
You may apply another salve.
H:406 M:188 E:1913 W:997 &lt;-b&gt; 
The almost imperceptible sound of a burning fuse suddenly runs silent, followed
by such an enormous explosion that you find yourself roughly thrown to the 
ground. Where once stood Ethelbert, there is only a black and crimson crater as
the smoke clears.
You have slain Ethelbert.
Ethelbert drops a maidenhair leaf.
H:406 M:187 E:1913 W:997 &lt;-b&gt; 
A mortal heart still dripping blood is blown about the room, coming to a rest 
at your feet.
A charred and jagged skullcap goes flying off to the up.
