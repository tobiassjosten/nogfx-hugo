Before Phoenix Crest. (Western Celidon.)
A graceful birch tree grows up from the ground here, armoured with cracked and 
scaly bark. Elegantly inscribed upon a pillar of hematite, the Charter of 
Celidon glows from the entrance of the Phoenix Crest. A runic totem is planted 
solidly in the ground. A large feral wildcat prowls about here. A huge elephant
swings its trunk back and forth here. A pike with the decapitated head of Labil
has been erected. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares 
attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. A freshly hewn 
log is partially hidden in the underbrush.
You see exits leading down, and a majestic granite gateway of Celidon Council 
opens to the in (gate open).
