Apollonia, the Oracle of Madness shouts, "The world does not come to an end simply 
because of this gemhunt...killing to get gems will probably find you struck down, 
however wars and conflicts wait for noone."

You tell Apollonia, the Oracle of Madness, "Appreciate it. That was lame. Caarnonan 
called for Laila, Sani, Aidan, and Drillian against the lil' ol' Harbinger of 
Catastrophe."

Apollonia, the Oracle of Madness tells you, "Well, you're scary, I almost fainted 
right away I tell you."
