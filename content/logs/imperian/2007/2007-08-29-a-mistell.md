Issue #9434   Reported by: Isadarr    Re: Kephas
2007-08-29 22:08:59: 
From the time Kephas left Stavenn to even now, his player has been using the 
forum as a way to OOC harass me and avoid IG interaction with my character.  He
can be mad at my character all he wants, but frankly any time he makes posts it
is to insult the player base as a whole, and to constantly drudge up the fact 
his character got told off by mine. He's posting false logs, false quotes, and 
insulting and childish comments about me even though I haven't talked to him in
any way since the initial event, months ago.  He is using the forum as a way to
OOCly harass me as a player and trying to bring down anything that has to do 
with my character, this time going as far as using a false, sexual quote 
regarding my character even. I don't talk to him, I don't interact with his 
character, and I feel that I'm being harassed, even sexually now, by false logs
and information having to do with me and my character that reflect a sexually 
inappropriate manner.  The fact he uses a made up AOL log in his forum 
signature, and is always posting about me and that stupid situation is proof, 
along with the post in the quotes section about false sexual comments that are 
geared towards harassing me. I would appreciate it if this would stop, as I 
have not interacted with him or care to and keep being harassed by him 
regardless
