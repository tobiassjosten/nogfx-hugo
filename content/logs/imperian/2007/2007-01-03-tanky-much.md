This area is unnaturally flooded with water. The stars twinkle in the clear 
night sky. A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. Tomast the 
Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The spring of crystalline 
water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to 
form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a 
source of inspiration and life. Lying on the ground is a broadsword. A small 
sign points into a market stall. The towering presence of Peravus, ancient 
Caananite seems to dominate the room here. A withering corojo leaf lies here. A
single steel shot lies here, yet to be fired. A shattered statue of Slythera, a
goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. Advancing with teeth bared, the 
wolverine objects to the intrusion. A guileful red fox prowls around here, 
looking for something to sink its teeth into. A knife of what looks to be bone 
has been dropped here. A charred and bloodied chunk of someone's head lies 
here, mostly just skullcap. There are 2 severed ears here. There are 2 
mutilated legs here. A roan mustang is here, its long, full mane flowing freely
in the wind. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is here. A stunning statue of
Hozarak, carved from pure white marble, stands here, eyes closed with an 
expression of absolute bliss upon its face. The decapitated head of Surotcal 
has been carelessly tossed aside. The decapitated head of Surotcal has been 
carelessly tossed aside. A massive alligator lies here, slowly decaying. An 
undulating mass of water, cascading and swirling into itself, has settled here.
The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. A wormwood 
root has been left here. There are 8 toadstools in a group here. There are 2 
lovage leaves in 2 groups here. A small orphine seed lies here. A small red 
juniper berry has been dropped here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly 
here, staring at you with its many eyes. There are 8 holocaust globes here. 
Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Melete, the 
Guide is here, wreathed in divine fire.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
