A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. A portrait of Malkav 
sitting upon his silver throne hangs upon the wall here. A large dusty tome is 
here, propped upon a marble pedestal. In the center of the floor, a large

the Younger is here, deep in thought. Harum-Scarum is here, sleeping soundly.
You see exits leading down (open door) and out.
Malaclypse looks up at you expectantly.
