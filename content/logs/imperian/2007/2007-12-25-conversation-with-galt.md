This is from my POV, Theres.
-------------------------------
So Galt filed an issue against me after I used in-room Telepathy attacks on him in his screened Grove. This is the gist of it since he deleted the issue.

Issue #xxxxx   Reported by: Galt    Re: Theres
Using Telepathy attacks in an screened Grove.

Issue #11127   Reported by: Galt    Re: Theres
2007-12-23 22:59:04: 
To be precise, he was using mind crush, mind illusion and mind 
paralyse/afflict. This was in a screened grove - He should not have been able 
to mindlock me to use the skills, and to my knowlegde, of those three, mind 
crush at least requires an actual mindlock. He has a mind print of me, which 
might be why he could ignore screen. If this isn't the case, and none of these 
skills now require a lock, perhaps screen should simply block telepathy - 
Especially as it will soon only effect the person who's grove it is, and not 
their allies. Many skills have had the mindlock requirement removed without any
change to screen or the strength of the skills.

My previous reply wasn't serious because his issue was a joke. He didn't even 
ask me about the skills but immediately issued me in the middle of the FFA. 
Mind Crush, Hallucination, Paralysis, and every other Telepathy abilities I 
used on Galt didn't require a Mindlock at all. All of them were done in the 
same room as him. Grove Screen blocks a Monk from mindlocking an Arboreal but 
does nothing to ward against Telepathy attacks in the same room that do not 
require them. If Galt actually a) learn about the skills before screaming 
'Abuse! Issue issue!' and b) bothered to ask me instead of issuing in the 
middle of a fight then the admins wouldn't have to be dealing with such a 
stupid issue as this.
----------------------
So today this occured.

----------------------

You have slain Galt.
Galt leaves to the ether, a wyvern reflected in his eyes.
You earn 1707 gold for winning the event!
You look around triumphantly and realize you are the last one standing. You 
have WON the combat free-for-all.

Galt tells you, "Well done, you can spam transmute!"

You tell Galt Amherst, "I'm awaiting another issue from you."

(Market): Galt says, ""We can't let a monk have the truefavour, especially as he fails as a Justicar!"

Galt tells you, "There is a bug with screen :)."

Galt tells you, "And I'm not the first to find it."

Galt tells you, "What -I'm- waiting for is hallucinate becomin party to the illusion detection that other things suffer."

Galt tells you, "Then you won't be able to do jack crap. Fun!"

You tell Galt Amherst, "Report 339."

Galt tells you, "They -should- just make lifevision catch it, unless they just take it away altogether because of the consensus from -everyone but monks- that you're not meant to be an illusion class."

You tell Galt Amherst, "That's great. Why don't you issue about it?"

You tell Galt Amherst, "^^."

Galt tells you, "Say the word "issue" to me again and I'll issue ;) Snubbed!"

That person has chosen to snub you.

---------------------
So in a following FFA:

You turn to face Galt, feeling the power of Kai building within you. Two 
radiant arcs of white lightning dart forth from your eyes, striking out at your
foe who begins to recoil in horror. Resistance is futile, however, and the 
deadly energy flows relentlessly forth from the glowing orbs of your eyes to 
engulf him entirely. Blood and skin boiling, Galt gives one final shriek of 
terrified agony before dropping, lifeless, to the floor.
You have slain Galt.
Galt leaves to the ether, a wyvern reflected in his eyes.
You earn 1275 gold for winning the event!
You look around triumphantly and realize you are the last one standing. You 
have WON the combat free-for-all.

Galt Amherst says, "Ahahah."

(Market): Galt says, "Join queue. A monk who puts up deliverance when people 
use meteors doesn't deserve a Truefavour!"

(Market): Iriaen says, "Galt is in the Sienna Forest."

You tell Hermetic Iriaen Nessaja, "Ahaha."

Iriaen tells you, "Dude... he issued me..."
