A secluded meadow. (Seven Lake Basin.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. This quiet meadow in the lake basin boasts soft grasses, and softer 
soil. The entire area feels gentle, peaceful. The air is cool and mild, stirred
from time to time by light breezes wafting through the meadow. A few low lying 
bushes dot the landscape, their foliage dark green against the light grass. A 
sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. Ria is sitting on 
the ground. Milite Shayda is here.
You see a single exit leading northwest.
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Everything appears a bit less imposing as the world is bathed in the bronze 
rays of Arviz rising above.
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Milite Shayda says, "Alright."
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Shayda sits down.

Milite Shayda strips and kneels down again, stroking the hound once more, a 
wicked grin directed at Kheoss.
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Ria tells you, "You're going to let her do this?"
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
The air grows moist as occasional drops of rain fall from the sky.

Milite Shayda 's smile returns to a grin as her hand descends lower, rubbing 
gently over the dog's genital areas, stroking the sheath there with a gentle, 
but firm caress.
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Ria tells you, "Very very true...mhm. Couldn't she get kicked out of the city

H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Ria tells you, "You should kill her...I just might get sick..."

Ria Argyle exclaims, "Just get a man!"
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Milite Shayda says, "Because I'd be a slut if I walked up to a man and said, 
"Hey, let's fuck."."
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Ria Argyle says, "But you fuck DOGS! That's worse."
H:314 M:326 <eb> 
Milite Shayda says, "I've also fucked an Ouroboros."
H:314 M:326 <eb>
