A mountain road. (road).
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The elevation here is mild, no strain
to traverse, and the vegetation along the roadway is primarily the grasses of 
the plains, but large angular stones protrude here and there, tumbled basalt 
from some explosion. The road, easily distinguished by the gleaming, smoothly 
carved stone wanders generally east or south, twisting around a few massive 
boulders. A careless touch on one of the black boulders will result in a 
quickly withdrawn hand, slightly singed with heat. There are 4 red and black 
centipedes here. Kunteki Jimek Sar'Kien is here.
You see exits leading east and up.
