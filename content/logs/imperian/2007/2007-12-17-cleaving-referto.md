You raise a hefty broadsword over your head and begin to swing it in a wide 
circle, gaining speed as you go.
<443/450h 306/320m 2054e 1504w 69x <e-pp> <bd>> 
Referto arrives from the north.
[Referto - here]
<443/450h 306/320m 2055e 1504w 69x <e-pp> <bd>> 
You have recovered balance.
<443/450h 306/320m 2055e 1504w 69x <ebpp> <bd>> 
A shimmering translucent shield forms around Referto.
<443/450h 306/320m 2055e 1504w 69x <ebpp> <bd>> `s0

[Trigger level set on 0.]
[No trigger can cause anything to be sent.]
<443/450h 306/320m 2055e 1504w 69x <ebpp> <bd>> 
You begin to bear down on Referto, preparing to destroy him.
<443/450h 306/320m 2055e 1504w 69x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Referto's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
<443/450h 306/320m 2055e 1504w 69x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Referto takes a long drag off his pipe, exhaling a thick, white haze.
<443/450h 306/320m 2055e 1504w 69x <ebpp> <bd>>  
Referto swings mightily at your torso causing you to drop your guard.
<443/450h 302/320m 2056e 1504w 69x <ebpp> <bd>> 
Referto balls up one fist and hammerfists you.
He connects to the left leg!
Your shield absorbs some of the damage.

<375/450h 302/320m 2056e 1504w 69x <ebpp> <bd> <-23>> 
Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, you bring your broadsword crashing 
straight down on Referto's head. With a power that seems to come from on high, 
you cleave asunder his entire body, from head to groin, splitting him in two 
and killing him instantly.
You have slain Referto.
