Within the great Library of Caanae. (ruins of Caanae.)
Busily examining the library, Mathardan the Loresage wanders about. A small 
black cobra is flaring its hood here. This is a library. Marckarius Faris is 
here. He wields an iron-tipped whip in his left hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.

Your aggressive action causes your mask to fall away.
You slowly make your away around behind Marckarius, far enough away to remain 
inconspicuous.

As you approach Marckarius's back, you quietly draw your knife to the ready, 
holding it low and out of sight.

With one last, silent step, you find yourself directly behind Marckarius and 
prepare yourself for the pounce.

A flick of the wrist, a flash of your blade, and you take Marckarius hostage 
with your knife to his throat.

Marckarius Faris says, "Ride home."

You swiftly drag the edge of your knife across Marckarius's throat, splitting 
flesh and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to flow from the 
horrible wound in his neck as he topples to the ground, turning around to give 
you a look of despair as the light slowly fades from his eyes.
You have slain Marckarius.
Marckarius drops a fragile, yellowed piece of parchment.
