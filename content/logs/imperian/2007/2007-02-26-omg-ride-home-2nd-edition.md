You slowly make your away around behind Marckarius, far enough away to remain 
inconspicuous.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2125e 1581w 0x &gt;
You have recovered balance.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2126e 1581w 0x &gt;
The bright sun shines down upon you.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2126e 1581w 0x &gt;
As you approach Marckarius's back, you quietly draw your knife to the ready, 
holding it low and out of sight.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
Marckarius reels in his fishing line.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
Marckarius carefully attaches a pink coloured shrimp to the hook on his fishing
pole.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
With one last, silent step, you find yourself directly behind Marckarius and 
prepare yourself for the pounce.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
Marckarius swings a bamboo fishing pole behind his head and whips it forward, 
sending his line sailing away to the north.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
A flick of the wrist, a flash of your blade, and you take Marckarius hostage 
with your knife to his throat.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
Performer Marckarius Faris says, "Ride home." 
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt; execute hostage
take body

You swiftly drag the edge of your knife across Marckarius's throat, splitting 
flesh and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to flow from the 
horrible wound in his neck as he topples to the ground, turning around to give 
you a look of despair as the light slowly fades from his eyes.
You have slain Marckarius.
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
(Market): Marckarius says, "Seeking information why an artifact'd aspect has to
hostage fishermen."
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
(Market): You say, "Seeking information on why a bard is trying to ride home."

&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
Vorast tells you, "There's a reason for that. Said bard is either an idiot or 
an ex-runelorist, in the latter case it's force of habit."

Orovan tells you, in Akrabi, "Fazlee..."
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
Orovan tells you, in Akrabi, "I never say this, but you are awesome."
&lt;445/445h 336/336m 2127e 1581w 0x &gt;
Orovan tells you, in Akrabi, "Yeah, feel proud."
