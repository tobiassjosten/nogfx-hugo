A huge rock comes spiraling out of the skies, crushing your body as it lands 
directly on top of you. The rock shatters sending rubble everywhere.
Falling from the skies, a huge rock narrowly misses you, strikes the ground,   &lt;-  MISSED.

Nearing the northern city. (road). (Vardarian Highlands.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Cresting a small hill, the path now 
rises enough to give sight of a great city rising to the north. Large walls 
dominate most of the view, and tall towers rise up behind them. The path is 
wider and beginning to become cobbled, betraying its growing importance. The 
sides of the path have been cleared of brush and any items, though hills rise 
up a little away, making it difficult to navigate off-path. An obsidian eye 
sigil is here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A large, 
powerful looking stallion stands here, eyeing you cautiously. The decaying 
remains of Orovan lie here.
You see exits leading northeast and south.

A strange force prevents you from going in that direction.
