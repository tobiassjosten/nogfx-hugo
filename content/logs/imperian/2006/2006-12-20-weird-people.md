Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small orphine seed lies 
here. A vibrant crimson embroidered hammock hangs here, its ruby beads 
glimmering slightly with each gentle movement of the wind. A small sign points 
into a market stall. A knife of what looks to be bone has been dropped here. 
The towering presence of Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate the room 
here. A large bone lies on the ground here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. The decapitated head of Rav has been carelessly 
tossed aside. A brown and white dog romps around playfully, wagging his tail 
and searching for bones. A simpering, foul Sycophant plods here. Sazabi is 
here, hidden. Djanya is here. She wields a sturdy shortsword in her left hand. 
Acolyte of Darkness, Ryanith is here, meditating. Initiate Rai is here.

The empty southern square. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A red
