earth-shaking roar, you release a white-hot jet of fire directly at Cragoy.
With an instinctive gesture of self-preservation, Cragoy raises his arms ahead 
of himself in terror as the jet of white-hot fire shoots towards him through 
the air. The gesture is futile, as the column of flame incinerates poor Cragoy 
instantly. For a second his charred skeleton stands transfixed before you, then
crumbles to ashes.
You have slain Cragoy.
