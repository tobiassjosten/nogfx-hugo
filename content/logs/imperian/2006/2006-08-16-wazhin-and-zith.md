Rotten foundations of an inn.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A stone
tower has been erected here in honour of the Griever, remaining true to the 
influences of ruin in its ever-crumbling state. A grey mist hangs in the air 
around its base, through which a serpent of granite and steel is seen 
constricted about the stone blocks. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly 
here, staring at you with its many eyes. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, 
flexing its long wiry antennae. A puffy black bloodleech scutters about in the 
dirt here. A white worm squirms on the ground. A puddle of green slime bubbles 
on the floor. The shimmering form of a soulmaster floats in the air. A 
hand-sized tick quivers on the ground. A mutated humanoid rat sniffs about, 
reeking of filth. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems 
to have a vicious glint to its eyes. There are 2 large wall of ices here. 
Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky 
mist has settled here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this 
nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. Dominus, Wazhin Q'azis, 
Pravos Occisor is here. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand. 
Adept of the Shield, Aoric is here, sprawled on the ground. He holds a buckler 
in each hand.

Rotten foundations of an inn.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A stone
tower has been erected here in honour of the Griever, remaining true to the 
influences of ruin in its ever-crumbling state. A grey mist hangs in the air 
around its base, through which a serpent of granite and steel is seen 
constricted about the stone blocks. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly 
here, staring at you with its many eyes. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, 
flexing its long wiry antennae. A puffy black bloodleech scutters about in the 
dirt here. A white worm squirms on the ground. A puddle of green slime bubbles 
on the floor. The shimmering form of a soulmaster floats in the air. A 
hand-sized tick quivers on the ground. A mutated humanoid rat sniffs about, 
reeking of filth. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems 
to have a vicious glint to its eyes. There are 2 large wall of ices here. 
Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. A black, murky 
mist has settled here. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this 
nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. The body of a dead baby 
rat lies here. Dominus, Wazhin Q'azis, Pravos Occisor is here.
You see exits leading southwest and down.

Rotten foundations of an inn.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A stone
tower has been erected here in honour of the Griever, remaining true to the 
influences of ruin in its ever-crumbling state. A grey mist hangs in the air 
around its base, through which a serpent of granite and steel is seen 
constricted about the stone blocks. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, 
flexing its long wiry antennae. A puffy black bloodleech scutters about in the 
dirt here. A white worm squirms on the ground. A puddle of green slime bubbles 
on the floor. The shimmering form of a soulmaster floats in the air. A 
hand-sized tick quivers on the ground. A mutated humanoid rat sniffs about, 
reeking of filth. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air.
A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and contort to the form 
of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness. An icewall is 
here, blocking passage to the down. The body of a dead baby rat lies here. With
a beautiful smile on its face an enchanting guardian angel floats here, 
gleaming with a beautiful hazy topaz glow. The shining figure of a Seraphic 
guardian floats in the air here. Rasca Anar, the Shaman is here. He wields a 
spiritual mace in his left hand and a tribal hunting shield of the wilds in his
right. Sir William Eruanna, Eternal Optimist is here. He is holding a tower 
shield in his right hand.

Rotten foundations of an inn.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A stone
tower has been erected here in honour of the Griever, remaining true to the 
influences of ruin in its ever-crumbling state. A grey mist hangs in the air 
around its base, through which a serpent of granite and steel is seen 
constricted about the stone blocks. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, 
flexing its long wiry antennae. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram 
floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and 
contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the 
darkness. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the down. The body of a dead 
baby rat lies here. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you
with its many eyes. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite 
seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes. The decaying remains of William lie 
here. A twisted nightshade root has been dropped here. A puffy black bloodleech
scutters about in the dirt here. A white worm squirms on the ground. A mutated 
humanoid rat sniffs about, reeking of filth. The shining figure of a Seraphic 
guardian floats in the air here. Rasca Anar, the Shaman is here, sprawled on 
the ground. He is holding a tribal hunting shield of the wilds in his right 
hand. Dominus, Wazhin Q'azis, Pravos Occisor is here.
You see exits leading southwest and down.

Rotten foundations of an inn.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A stone
tower has been erected here in honour of the Griever, remaining true to the 
influences of ruin in its ever-crumbling state. A grey mist hangs in the air 
around its base, through which a serpent of granite and steel is seen 
constricted about the stone blocks. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, 
flexing its long wiry antennae. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram 
floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and 
contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the 
darkness. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the down. A black ouroboros 
oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two 
scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its 
eyes. A twisted nightshade root has been dropped here. A white worm squirms on 
the ground. A mutated humanoid rat sniffs about, reeking of filth. Dominus, 
Wazhin Q'azis, Pravos Occisor is here. Demonsbreath, Zith Q'azis, The Occisor 
is here.

I see no "corpse" to take.

Rotten foundations of an inn.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A stone
tower has been erected here in honour of the Griever, remaining true to the 
influences of ruin in its ever-crumbling state. A grey mist hangs in the air 
around its base, through which a serpent of granite and steel is seen 
constricted about the stone blocks. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, 
flexing its long wiry antennae. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram 
floats in mid-air. A black, murky mist has settled here. The shadows bend and 
contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the 
darkness. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the down. A black ouroboros 
oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Hovering on two 
scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its 
eyes. A twisted nightshade root has been dropped here. A white worm squirms on 
the ground. A mutated humanoid rat sniffs about, reeking of filth. Dominus, 
Wazhin Q'azis, Pravos Occisor is here. Demonsbreath, Zith Q'azis, The Occisor 
is here.
You see exits leading southwest and down.
H:349 M:327 W:1750 &lt;eb db&gt; 
Wazhin follows you southwest.
Before a decaying statue.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. An 
eroded, dulled marble and gold statue of a woman stands crumbling upon its 
pedestal here.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, and west.
H:349 M:327 W:1750 &lt;eb db&gt; 
There is no exit in that direction.
H:349 M:327 W:1750 &lt;eb db&gt; 
Wazhin follows you southeast.
Between two mounds of rubble.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A stray
cat wanders around here, searching the ground for food. A large lizard is here,
sunning itself happily.
You see exits leading south and northwest.
H:349 M:327 W:1750 &lt;eb db&gt; 
Wazhin follows you south.
A wide, deserted road.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. You see
exits leading north, southwest, and west.
You are breathing lightly.
H:347 M:327 W:1750 &lt;eb db&gt; 
Wazhin follows you southwest.
The empty northern square.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. You see
exits leading northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.
You are breathing lightly.
H:344 M:327 W:1750 &lt;eb db&gt; 
Wazhin follows you south.
Aryana's Spring.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Leaning
heavily on his staff, Tomast the Cleric is here. The spring of crystalline 
water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to 
form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a 
source of inspiration and life. There are 2 preserved letters here. Glowing 
with a spectral luminescence, a boxed silver lantern sits here. A small sign 
points into a market stall. A simple hammock hangs here, inviting in its 
comfortable appeal. A puddle of green slime bubbles on the floor. Vic is here. 
He wields a plain sitara in his left hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
