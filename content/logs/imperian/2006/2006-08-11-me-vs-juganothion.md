Out on the saltwater lake.
Between the enormous expanse of lake and sky, the shore looms off in the 
distance, now only a ribbon of white and brown. Ripples of salty water roll 
along as various fowl land on the lake's surface or rise gracefully into the 
air again. Something firm brushes your leg as it swims by. A verdant green mist
fills the area with life. There are 9 golden sovereigns here. A small forest of
sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. An undulating mass of water, 
cascading and swirling into itself, has settled here. A sleek black hound 
stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A man-eating shark turns its cold 
black eyes towards you. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the 
ground. The terrible demonic form of Warlord Juganothion Gazali, the Arm of 
Death towers over you, filling you with fear. He wields a serpent-tooth sabre 
in each hand.
