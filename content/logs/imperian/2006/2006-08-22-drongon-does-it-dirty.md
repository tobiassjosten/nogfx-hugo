Before Phoenix Crest. (Western Celidon.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Elegantly inscribed upon a pillar of 
hematite, the Charter of Celidon glows from the entrance of the Phoenix Crest. 
A large feral wildcat prowls about here. A small, blue tinted glass sits here, 
discarded by its owner. The shrunken head of Jalanon has been left here, the 
last torments of life still visible upon his face. A freshly hewn log is 
partially hidden in the underbrush. A large red and brown desert buffalo stands
here, claws instead of hooves digging into the ground with tremendous force.
You see exits leading down, and a majestic granite gateway of Celidon Council 
opens to the in (gate open).

The Celidon Threshold. (Celidon Council.)
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. The 
soothing aroma of spearmint wafts around a fluffy little humgii that sits in 
the center of the room with sparkling eyes. There are 2 Xiur Champion of 
Celidons here. A grim raven is perched here, glaring about grumpily. A Lycaean 
knight is manning a bolt thrower here. He has seventy-one bolts. There are 6 
Lycaean knights here. Untamed wisps of green aura float around the leaping 
figure of a massive, jade tiger in praise of the Wild One. The scent of 
peppermint emanates from the circle of pillars, while the sound of a rushing 
waterfall and vibrant wildflowers envelop the senses. Lined with silken fabric 
of a silvery-blue hue, a simple basket sits in the corner. Emanating an aura of
strength and power, a mighty mountain grizzly stands here, lording over its 
domain. A hammock fashioned of silvery netting sways here slowly, its sides 
entwined  with vines of green ivy. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular
monolith is on the ground. Caelas Willowbrook stands here alert, scanning the 
area for signs of trouble. There are 2 fruit bats here. There are 7 nymph 
enchantress here. A sooty piece of cool charcoal lies on the ground. A black 
hound of Dis bares his fangs menacingly as it keeps a watchful eye on the area.
Katsuma Tokugawa is here. He wields a truesilver battleaxe in his left hand and
a truesilver broadsword in his right.
You see exits leading north, up, and a massive granite boulder stands vigilant 
to the out (gate open).
Caelas Willowbrook says, "Welcome to the Council of Celidon! Remember to be on 
your best behavior, and don't kill our fruit bats."

You focus the might of the Lady of the Waters into Katsuma to force him to obey
your command.
Katsuma is unable to resist the force of your faith.
Gathering his precious essence, Katsuma closes his eyes and concentrates. His 
mortal frame begins to shake as he slowly drains the smallest portion of his 
own life into the corpse of Rafe, the Blademaster. The corpse of Rafe, the 
Blademaster screams in rage as the soul enters the body.
The corpse of Rafe, the Blademaster rises from the ground in undeath.
