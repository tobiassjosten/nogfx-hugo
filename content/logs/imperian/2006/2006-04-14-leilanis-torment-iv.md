Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Leaving?"

You say, "I think so, not feeling to good."

Knavia looks resentfully at you and pouts with a vengeance.

"Awwwww!" Blakven says.

Knavia nods his head.

Leilani shifts her cloak, wincing slightly.

You ponder the situation.

Knavia tells you, "You're sure you don't want to talk about it?"

"Shoo! Shoo!" Knavia says to Blakven as he waves him away.

Blakven grins mischievously.

Blakven waves and says "Goodbye!"

Knavia gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

You shuffle your feet uneasily.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "You're going to tell me."

You follow Knavia to the south.

-walking-

Knavia reaches over and pulls firmly on a candelabra, causing it to tilt
slightly towards him with a creak. There is a loud screeching noise, and a
large slab of the marble floor slides away in a cloud of dust, revealing steps
leading down.

You follow Knavia to the down.

Decaying hidden archives.
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. In one
corner lie the rotted remains of an ancient wooden chest. A skeleton is curled
up tightly here, clothes and flesh rotted away to nothing. A sigil in the shape
of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A naturally coloured hammock
has been hung here, its tassels swaying gently in the breeze.
You see a single exit leading up.

You shake your head.
You shake your head.

A candelabra next to you raises slightly, creaking as it does, and the exit
leading upwards is sealed

Knavia points accusingly at a comfortable rope hammock.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Sit."

You reach over and give a candelabra a firm pull, and it tilts forward slightly
with a creak. A loud screeching noise echoes about the room, and a large slab
of the marble above you slides away, covering you with dust and revealing steps
leading up.

A quiet alcove. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
You see exits leading north and down.

Knavia arrives from the down.
He is followed by a fearsome lion.

The candelabra raises back into place with a creak, and the slab of marble once
more slides out to seal the floor, shuddering slightly as it does.

Knavia gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

You say, "Not there..."

You shudder violently as a chill ripples down your spine.

Knavia purses his lips contemplatively.

Knavia nods his head.

Knavia sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Well."

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Here?"

You say, "Anywhere... but not there."

Knavia nods slowly.

Knavia makes a beckoning motion to no one in particular.

-walking-
Knavia points accusingly at a hammock of snowy, moonlit hues.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Now, sit and tell me all."

Knavia stares implacably at you.

You crease your brow in a frown.

Inside an abandoned house. (lost) (Bors Lake.)
An intricate mosaic tile floor of blooming reds and blues is revealed under the
swirling silt and debris that litter this place. The walls are still hung with
paintings, although the paint has long since dissolved, leaving only sad, empty
framed to add to the desolation that suffuses this place. The crumbling doorway
to the north is still standing, however the rooms beyond have collapsed,
leaving them impassable. Emanating crisp comfort, a snowy hammock of moonlit
hues hangs here. A black eel lingers here, blending with the watery shadows.
Clothed in tatters, a spectral villager floats here. A fearsome lion prowls
around here and greets you with a warning roar. Knavia Kwindan, Of the First
Circle is here.

You see a single exit leading south.

You take a seat on a hammock of snowy, moonlit hues.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Did someone hurt you?"

Leilani sighs softly, rubbing her wrists absentmindedly as she ponders her
response. "There is nothing you can do to help the situation." She finally
says, quietly.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle gazes at you quite levelly, his eyes fixed
on your face as he replies," That doesn't meant that I  don't want to know what
happened to distress you so"

Knavia sits down.

Leilani slumps down a bit, wrapping her arms around her midsection as she stares
hard at the tiled floor. "... I will tell you, then. Someone... someone that I
cannot really harm, or truly escape, has taken an interest in me. He has decided
that I should... belong to him. He is not used to.. not getting his way
apparently," she whispers quietly, her face losing its color as she speaks.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle sighs gently, resting his head back against
the door frame as he stares into the nothingness above," I'm sorry" the skin
below his lip caves in as he bites into the soft tissue beneath in
contemplation. After a moments pause he simply asks,"Who?"

Leilani digs her nails into her palms as her small hands clench into tight
fists unknowingly, she glances about herself as if she expects to see someone
step out of the shadows at any moment, "..I..I don't know if I should tell you
that," she whispers nervously.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle nods his head slowly, his gaze settling on
you silently, still chewing on his cheek as he considers some more." Well, has
he hurt you?". The concern in his voice evident as he awaits your answer.

Leilani bites down hard on her lip as she fights back tears,
nodding her head slowly.

Knavia gives a pained sigh.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle bites onto his knuckle before saying
softly," You.. " he sighs," I cannot help you if you don't tell me what
happened," his eyes fall to the sandy floor as he murmurs quietly," You know
that you are like a daughter to me.. or perhaps something else. It hurts
knowing that you are in pain."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Leilani shrinks down, whimpering as she seems to come to a decision. Her arm
raises, revealing a deeply bruised wrist bearing deeply etched rope burns.
Her fingertips brush against her throat where her collar once sat, drawing
attention to the deep bruises there. "...Sethren," she whispers quietly.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle frowns as he moves slowly towards you,
approaching you like a flighty bird. His cool fingers grasp your wrist gently
and he sighs as he inspects the markings more closely. His gaze travelling to
your throat and his voice is thick with emotion as he whispers, " I'm so
sorry"

Leilani frowns slightly, pulling her hand from your touch. "Those... are there
because of me. Because I attacked him and tried to escape. If I had waited until
the right moment... then I wouldn't have been hurt. I was foolish." she whispers
angrily. "I don't know why he thinks he can steal me. I am a woman, not a slave.
Not property." she cries defeatedly, slumping down. She winces suddenly, sitting
back up straight to ease her discomfort.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle nods slightly, moving away from you to lean
once more upon the door frame," I don't think that Sethren has ever met a woman
quite like you, though" he muses for a moment before carrying on, " I do know
that he does tend to be.. rough.. to put it lightly". He frowns as he considers
the situation," What are you going to do about him?"

Knavia creases his brow in a frown.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "I am sorry my dear, but I have to be
departing."

You nod your head.You give Knavia a peck on the cheek.

You say, "...I will be okay. Eventually. I'll find a way."

You nod your acknowledgement of yourself.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Stay safe for me."
