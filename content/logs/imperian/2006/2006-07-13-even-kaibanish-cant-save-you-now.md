You draw your blade back and plunge it deep into the body of Rasca impaling him
to the hilt.
H:374 M:263 E:1761 W:1528 &lt;e- db&gt; You gather your breath and hurl a piercing battlecr
y towards Rasca.
Rasca falls to his knees and clutches his ears as the shaft of sound strikes 
him.

A ruinous hound slashes Rasca viciously.

You heave a sigh of relief as you are returned to reality.
An inlaid stone roadway. (road).
A full team of sturdy draft horses leads a huge caravan here. A shaggy grey 
mustang roams warily nearby. A ruinous hound growls excessively here. Hovering 
on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to 
its eyes. A black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its 
many eyes. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. Hands of rotting flesh
and white bone push up from the ground. Rasca Anar, the Ancient One is here, 
sprawled on the ground. Kabaal S'Sylistha is here. He wields a tower shield in 
his left hand and a wicked-looking daegger in his right. Shrouded in shadow, 
Lord Sparda Gazali stands here, a moonstone embedded in his forehead. He wields
an iron-tipped whip in his left hand and a needle-pointed dirk in his right.
You see exits leading north and southeast.

With a vicious snarl you carve a merciless swathe through the steaming guts of 
Rasca, who gurgles and chokes as you withdraw your dripping weapon, glistening 
with gore.
