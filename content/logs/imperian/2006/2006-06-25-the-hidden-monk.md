Cave of Meditation. (Monastery of Manoa.)
Though the atmosphere has become quite arid, the floor and walls of this 
chamber were apparently worn smooth by years of water erosion. A beautiful 
mosaic of colored tiles on the floor alludes to mortal habitation. The ceiling 
of this cave is high indeed, the walls ascending up into complete darkness. 
Looking closely at the walls around the cave it is possible to notice slight 
changes in the grain of the rock which reveal the exits in different 
directions. This has been marked as holy ground. Rising out of ruby-quartz and 
amber flames, a fiery crystal phoenix towers over you, while the silvery horn 
of a unicorn shines with a pure white light, illuminating your surroundings. 
There are 12 akrabi prayer mats here. A bear skin prayer mat rests on the 
ground here. Elamar is sitting on a rolled-up bear skin prayer mat. Apostle 
Nayyirah, Beloved of the Dawn is here.
You see a single exit leading east.

Patek arrives from the east.
He is followed by a large, gold flecked hawk named Kep.

Pressing his palms together before him, Patek performs a respectful bow.

Facing Patek, you press your palms together before you and perform a respectful
bow.

Nayyirah faces you, presses her palms together before her and performs a 
respectful bow.

Patek takes a seat on an akrabi prayer mat.

Patek's deadly tail sways slowly behind him.

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."
 
You seek out all mental presences within your reach:
You sense Paran Educator, Adherent Genjuro Valstivar at Cave of Meditation.
You sense Brother Elamar Savet Elandor at Cave of Meditation.
You sense Apostle Nayyirah, Beloved of the Dawn at Cave of Meditation. 
You sense Master Rilore Grahmwulf, Paran Educator at Cave of Meditation.

Nayyirah tilts her head and listens intently to you.

Apostle Nayyirah, Beloved of the Dawn says, in Lycaean, "Did I bow?"

Nayyirah faces Patek, presses her palms together before her and performs a 
respectful bow.

Patek's deadly tail sways slowly behind him.

You say, "I cannot see Adherent Genjuro, though I can sense him here."

Patek nods his head at Nayyirah politely.

Master Patek Qaqyesil, Kunteki of Manoa clicks.
 
Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Apostle Nayyirah, Beloved of the Dawn says, in Lycaean, "As do I."

Nayyirah creases her brow in a frown.

Master Patek Qaqyesil, Kunteki of Manoa says, "Locking."

Master Patek Qaqyesil, Kunteki of Manoa says, "Link?"

You begin directing your mental energies in support of Patek.

Your link with Patek dissolves.

Patek stands up from an akrabi prayer mat.

Patek leaves to the east.
He is followed by a large, gold flecked hawk named Kep.

You ponder for a moment and say "Hrm..."

You thrust your leg out towards Genjuro with considerable force.
Genjuro is hurled to the east by the strength of the blow.
 
Nayyirah follow you to the east.
A narrow passage. (Monastery of Manoa.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A beautiful portrait adds a calming 
atmosphere to the room. An elegant bookcase stands against the wall here. A 
large, gold flecked hawk hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings 
shimmering in the light. Master Patek Qaqyesil, Kunteki of Manoa is here.
You see exits leading west and down.

Nayyirah blinks.

Genjuro blinks.

Master Patek Qaqyesil, Kunteki of Manoa turns his head in all directions 
quickly, taking in the area.

Patek sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

A narrow passage. (lost) (Monastery of Manoa.)
The ceiling rises somewhat higher but remains low enough to hang ominously not 
far overhead. Dressed stone that seems to have been worked ages ago with crude 
tools supports the cave from crumbling in on itself. The musky and damp smell 
of the cave is strong here, and stones protrude from the rough walls on all 
sides. Insects scuttle across the floor with a soft hissing, crawling out of 
the way of your boots in an attempt to avoid being crushed. The squeak of rats 
and other vermin can be heard as well, though none are in evidence. This has 
been marked as holy ground. A beautiful portrait adds a calming atmosphere to 
the room. An elegant bookcase stands against the wall here. A large, gold 
flecked hawk hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings shimmering in the 
light. Master Patek Qaqyesil, Kunteki of Manoa is here. Paran Educator, 
Adherent Genjuro Valstivar is here. Apostle Nayyirah, Beloved of the Dawn is 
here.
You see exits leading west and down.

You say, "Now I can see him."
 
Patek pokes Genjuro harmlessly with the base of his stinger.

Apostle Nayyirah, Beloved of the Dawn says, in Akrabi, "I can see him now too."

Paran Educator, Adherent Genjuro Valstivar says, "Who? wha?"

Master Patek Qaqyesil, Kunteki of Manoa says, "Ahh."
 
Patek nods his head.

Nayyirah blinks incredulously at Genjuro.

You thrust your leg out towards Genjuro with considerable force.
Genjuro is hurled to the west by the strength of the blow.

Patek leaves to the west.
He is followed by a large, gold flecked hawk named Kep.

didn't though."
