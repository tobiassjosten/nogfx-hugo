Renoir has WON the Bloodbath in the Coliseum with 34 points!
Overlooking the ruins of the coliseum.
A small bat rests slain here. Cheeks still packed with food, a small chipmunk 
lies here dead. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching 
all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of night perches nearby
and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Poised nervously on slender legs,
a pronghorn antelope stands here. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters 
merrily. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. 
Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. Hibou Reopev,
Crimson Edge is here, shrouded. Brother Matty Faris is here. Ryn Kuro-Sasori is
here. He wields a hunter's spear in his left hand and a throwing axe in his 
right. Brother Renoir Virs, Protector of Manoa is here. Brother Nashquil Argyle
is here. Brother Sani Anar, Cognizant of Antioch is here.
You see a single exit leading down.
Trax arrives from the ether.
You fight down fear as Khalim enters from the ether, a wyvern reflected in his 
eyes.

Sani smiles as he rams his fist into his jaw.
You have slain Sani.
Your soul cries out in ecstasy as it reaches new heights of power. You have 
advanced to level 73.
You have reached the illustrious level of Empyreal.

You see a bright light shine on you as all your afflictions are cured. (all)

Later on..

You gently lay the corpse of Sani into the cool waters of Aryana's Spring.
Sani's wounds heal and he opens his eyes as life is restored to him.

Brother Sani Anar, Cognizant of Antioch says to you, "Sit."
