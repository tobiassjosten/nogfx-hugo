Under the banana trees. (Ruins of n'Aryanvella.)

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. There are 2 banana trees here.

You see exits leading south and west.

Sethren emerges from his hiding place.

You blink.

Sethren grins mischievously.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hello."

You tilt your head curiously.

Sethren Argyle says, "Don't worry, I was only following you for a bit."

You ponder the situation.

You smile impishly and say, "Following me? Must have been rather boring."

"Heh heh heh," Sethren chuckles.

Sethren Argyle says, "No, not too bad."

Leilani leans back against the tree, tucking her books into her pack.

Sethren Argyle says, "Was wondering if I was going to have to come out and help
you with S'telmas."

You give a mischievous grin.

You say, "The obnoxious zealot, you mean?"

Sethren nods his head.

Sethren Argyle says, "Is there any other kind?"

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You smile with a wink and say, "Eh, he's harmless as a kitten. You know the
kind that bite you randomly when you start petting them."

"Mhmm," Sethren murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

You smile impishly and say, "I can run fast when the need arises."

He is a serpentine Ssylsin and is very tall, seeming almost gaunt. He appears
full of energy, like a coiled spring waiting to be released. Crimson scales
cover his lithe body, and his tail swings slowly behind him, of its own
volition. His eyes are a deep black, showing currents of varying emotions
behind them. His face is rather long, his cheeks shallow, and a forked tongue
flicks out from between his lips intermittently. A scar in the shape of an "X"
is visible on the back of his left hand. He is wearing a formal black collared
shirt, a tattoo of a unicursal hexagram, a deck of Tarot cards, a pair of
fingerless, black leather gloves, a simple ring of silver, a suit of scale
mail, a dark crimson pouch, a bloodstone ring of the Malignists, a ring of
pestilence, a plain ring, an Imperial ring of the Ephors, a sinuous silver
snake bracelet, a silver ring etched with hearts, handsome, black tailored
pants, a thick platinum and emerald band, and a bloodstained leather satchel.
He wields a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand and a tower shield in his
right.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure you don't need to entirely too often."

You say, "We have met before, you helped me find Malkav's grove, I believe."

You ponder the situation.

Comprehension flashes across Sethren's face.

Sethren Argyle says, "I did remember you, I just wasn't sure from what."

You nod your head.

Sethren Argyle says, "Followed you out of curiosity."

You smile impishly and say, "I remember you. Your wife made me an interesting
offer, once."

Sethren smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

You say, "I don't exactly talk to many people either, hard to forget a face."

Sethren Argyle says, "What are you up to out here?"

Sethren tilts his head curiously.

You say, "I like it here, it's quiet..."

You say, "Nothing to distract me from my books."

Sethren Argyle says, "Except random people shadowing you."

Your eyes twinkle enchantingly.

Sethren smirks.

You say, "There is that."

You say, "You must have an incredibly dull life to follow me."

You smile impishly and say, "I am certain there are many more interesting
people."

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..not exactly."

Your eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "You're rather intriguing to me."

You blush furiously.

You say, "Erhm...why?"

Sethren Argyle says, "Not exactly sure. Just something about you."

Sethren Argyle says, "Maybe because you seem so quiet. Rare these days.."

Sethren ponders the situation.

Leilani frowns slightly, suddenly very focused on the papaya in her hands. "This... is true, I suppose," she whispers, as she drags a long fingernail into the flesh of the fruit.

Sethren Argyle eyes you curiously, watching your every movement. "Is something
wrong?"

Sethren Argyle swishes his tail slowly back and forth.

Leilani slowly peels back the thick skin of the papaya, the frown slowly easing to be replaced by a thoughtful look. "I am not used to such attention, or being followed into secluded jungles," she whispers, with a wry grin.

Sethren Argyle says, "I doubt many are used to it."

You smile impishly and say, "Probably quite true. I would not know. I do not do
much following about."

Sethren nods his head.

Sethren Argyle says, "You'd rather stick to your books?"

Leilani smiles broadly, "Books are safe... erhm... I mean... they bring me
pleasure with no complications," she says in a rush. Her smile fading as she
stumbles over her words, her face flushed as she stops speaking.

Sethren Argyle tilts his head as she stops speaking. "Well..perhaps this
meeting can be fortunate?" He makes a sudden movement to wrap his tail very
lightly around her, pulling her a little bit closer. "I would think..I could be
a little more interesting than books."


Leilani blushes brightly, gasping in surprise as he pulls her closer. She ducks
quickly away, and runs off without a word.

You shiver violently.

You collapse in a heap on the floor, unwilling to bear the pain any longer.

Sethren moves over to block the west exit.

Sethren Argyle says, "There you are."

Sethren Argyle tilts his head curiously at you, his tail swaying behind him.
"Wasn't expecting you to run away like that...".

Leilani whimpers, growing very pale as she backs quickly away from you.

Sethren Argyle says, "You know why.."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Sethren Argyle says, "I don't much like when people run away from me."

Leilani glances around looking for a way to get around you, whispering in a
panicked tone, "I... I am not... used to people touching me. I meant you ...
no offense." She clutches her tome tightly to her chest as she suddenly tries
to push her way around you.

Sethren stops you from moving that way.

Sethren Argyle wraps his tail around you now that you can't get away. He pulls
you closer to him, taking hold of your wrist to keep you still. "Hm..just as
interesting as I thought, then.".

Leilani beings to tremble, biting down on her lower lip. "Please, Sir, let me
go. I don't know why you find me so interesting... I assure you I am not. Just
let me go..."

Sethren Argyle grins slightly, whispering to you, "I think..." At his he moves
his tail to one of your legs, pulling it out from under you and sending you to
the ground, his hold on your wrist still firm. "..not."

Leilani yelps as she lands hard on the ground, instantly trying to scramble away.
Finding herself trapped beneath you she moves to slap you as hard as she can,
kicking her feet hard against he ground in an attempt to slip from your grasp.

Sethren Argyle responds by reaching out and catching your other wrist. He
smirks slightly, crouching down next to you and tightening his grip on both
wrists, a bit painfully. "I would not advise attempting to escape, at the
moment. I wouldn't want to hurt you.".

Leilani grows very pale at your words, trembling violently as she begins to
plead with you, "Please... just let me go. I didn't do anything to you, why
are you doing this?" Her eyes fill with tears that threaten to burst forth
at any moment as she wriggles a bit beneath you, testing your grip on her
wrists.

Sethren Argyle continues watching you intently, his eyes sparkling with
amusement. "Why am I doing this? Well..I was sure I could convince you to
return my..interest. But now that you will not, for whatever reason..I think I
will just claim you anyway."

Leilani growls, a passionate rage flaring up in her eyes at your words, she
begins to struggle violently again. Trying her hardest to wrest her arms from
your tight grip, kicking her legs as hard as she can as she screams at you,
"I am not property to be claimed! I am a free woman. You can't just kidnap
people, what is wrong with you! Let me go now!"

Sethren Argyle smirks slightly again, his eyes growing cold. Letting go of one
of your wrists, he slaps you with full force across the face, his claws digging
shallow scratches in your skin. "I told you not to try to get away..but, no
matter. You'll learn yet.".

Leilani cries out, the hard slap unexpected stilling her quickly. She seems
to shrink beneath you, the tears finally bursting free as she begins to sob
quietly. "You can't... keep me here... forever you now. What do you want with
me...." she whimpers, her salty tears stinging the scratches in her throbbing
flesh.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..well. I could keep you here for as long as I wanted,
really. But I have no need to. And what do I want? Well..you."

Sethren Argyle has hold of both your wrists again, though not as tightly
because you seem less likely to struggle.

Sethren gazes intently at you, his forked tongue flickering inquisitively.

Leilani sniffles softly, staring up at you with a face stained with tears.
She whispers softly, "You can't just... take people. That's just not how it
works. Please... please let me go." Her trembling seems to calm as
she shifts her wrists a bit, attempting to ease her discomfort a bit.

Sethren Argyle grins in response, whispering back to you, "Mm..well, I don't
know about other people. But I certainly can. If I so wish..you will never be
able to escape me. However, with luck you will grow to not desire to leave
me."

Sethren Argyle swishes his tail leisurely back and forth, giving the appearance
of being relaxed.

Leilani glares up at you, "I highly doubt that," she hisses. Her eyes flash
hatred in your direction, as she takes attempts to take advantage of your
seeming relaxation to fight against you once more, jerking hard on her arms
and kicking up, twisting her body in an attempt to crawl away.

Sethren Argyle frowns slightly, "And here I thought you were coming to accept
it." Swiftly, he shoves you back onto the ground, his tail restraining you as
well. He pins you down beneath him, moving one hand to cover your mouth and
nose, entirely blocking off your breathing. "I won't have you escaping me..if
you promise you won't try to run away, I'll let you breathe. Nod your head if
you promise.."

Leilani freezes up instantly as you pin her down, her eyes growing wide at your
words. She quickly nods her head, as she struggles to draw breath beneath you.

Sethren Argyle smiles wryly, surprised at you giving in so quickly. He looks
curiously at you, deciding if you'll keep it. He seems to make a decision,
moving his hand away. "Now..if you break your promise, you will deeply regret
it. Keep that in mind."

Sethren whispers to you, "I think you're learning already."

You blush furiously.

Sethren Argyle says, "Are you going to try to escape on me?"

Sethren tilts his head curiously.

You shake your head.

You whisper to Sethren, "Please, if I promise not to run, will you let me sit
up?"

Sethren Argyle nods, moving back to his crouching position and off of you. He
keeps one of your hands tightly in his grasp, whispering to you, "You can't be
entirely trusted..yet."

Leilani raises herself slowly off the ground, watching you suspiciously for any
sign of movement. After she sits up, she wipes the tears from her face, and
brushes the dust from her clothing. She draws in a deep and shaky breath,
sitting up straight, "I... think you've proven that I cannot escape... at
the moment, at least." she whispers softly, frowning as she stares at the
ground in front of her feet. "Now what...do we do?" she asks quietly.

Sethren Argyle stretches slowly, returning to watching you intently. "Well, now
that you're calmer, it's much simpler. I suppose that we could return to the
city now...You do need to keep something in mind, though. You are mine, now. If
you escape I will catch you, and you will regret you ever -thought- to escape.
You know that isn't just an empty threat, don't you?"

Sethren tilts his head curiously.

Leilani blushes brightly, rubbing the side of her face gingerly. "I believe
you will make good on that threat, yes," she answers grumpily.

Sethren Argyle smiles brightly. "Good! Now. If we return to the city, will you
try to get away from me? Keep in mind..it is -my- city, the guards will not
help you."

You give a pained sigh.

You say, "I do not have much of a choice, do I?"

Sethren Argyle says, "You do not."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You frown and say, "Is there no way for you to be talked out of this? I am not
a slave, I am a free woman. Is not there a woman who would willingly cling to
your side?"

Sethren Argyle says, "There is no way. And I imagine there are plenty, but I do
not want them. I want -you-."

Sethren Argyle says, "Willing..isn't quite so fun."

Leilani slumps down, muttering, "Fine, I will follow you into the city. I do not
fancy more injuries." She glares at the hand you hold. "Am I allowed to stand,
then?" she asks, her head tilted up slightly as she glares at you, contempt
lacing her words.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..allowed?"

Sethren snaps his fingers in front of you.

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.

You blush furiously.

You begin to follow Sethren.

Sethren smirks.

You say, "...How... did you do that?"

You blink.

Sethren Argyle says, "I can turn your mind against you, what chance do you
have?"

Sethren swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Sethren Argyle says, "I simply put you under hypnosis while you were
unaware..fairly easy task."

Sethren Argyle says, "Perhaps you will see more of that later."

Sethren pats you in a friendly manner.

Leilani shivers violently, her flushed face growing very pale
as she stares down at her rebellious limbs.

-walk to the city-

A dim study in the Academy. (lost) (City of Stavenn.)
The back room of the Academy is shaped like a half-circle. The ceiling is flat,
and where the wall meets has marbleized molding of battles. Six columns
protrude from the wall, each crafted in the shape of an ominous, hooded figure.
Silver braziers take up the spaces between all of the columns, illuminating the
dark chamber with their golden light. The floor underfoot is the same crimson
marble with golden and white veins as decorates the entrance, and is also as
well-polished. A small bookcase rests against the flat wall near the door. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A carved stone bowl rests here,
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. An elegantly crafted
desk of charred redwood rests in a corner. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A beautifully rendered tarot card has
been discarded. Sethren Argyle is here. He wields a needle-pointed dirk in his
left hand and a tower shield in his right.

You see exits leading southeast and southwest.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..interesting. You didn't try to run."

Sethren Argyle says, "But of course..there's still that contempt in your eyes.
Will have to get rid of that.."

Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.

You angrily say, "You would hunt me down, you are watching and waiting for me
to do so. It would have been a foolish thing to do. I can still feel the
results of my last foolish action."

Sethren Argyle says, "You are learning very quickly. It would indeed be a bad
idea to escape."

You mutter, "For now."

Sethren smirks.

Sethren Argyle says, "I almost wish you did try..there's some things I've been
wanting to experiment with."

Sethren whispers to you, "If you don't believe me..it matters not. But I will
bend you to my will, in time. Eventually you will not even think of trying to
escape. You will enjoy being mine."

Leilani grows pale, backing slowly away from you, "I do not wish to partake of
your... experiments. And I think you are mistaken in that assumption, Sir,"
she growls, attempting to put herself on the far side of the desk from you.

Sethren Argyle tilts his head curiously, making no move to grab you. "That
wouldn't be you doing something foolish again, would it? I do wonder what you
hope to accomplish..".

Leilani closes her eyes for a long moment, her shoulders slumping down dejectedly.
She collapses into the chair beside the desk, laying her head on her arms on its
flat surface. She simply lays there silently for several long minutes. Finally,
she raises her head, meeting your gaze.

You whisper to Sethren, "I will behave, for now. I do not have much of a choice
at the moment. I do not hold my chances to be very good in attempting to escape
you here, in the city you have spent your life in. I can barely find my way to
the tavern. I do not have many options but to submit, for the moment."

Sethren Argyle sits down on the edge of the desk, nodding slowly.

Sethren whispers to you, "A wise decision. I do like how you keep saying "At
the moment", though. It's..cute."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement at you.

Leilani blushes brightly, staring intently at the desktop.

Sethren Argyle reaches over and strokes your hair with an odd tenderness, in
contrast with the violence of before.

Leilani glances warily up at you, confusion written on her face. After a bit
she closes her eyes, sighing heavily.

Sethren whispers to you, "Don't worry too much..it won't be all bad. I am quite
sure you'll grow to like it, in fact."

Leilani shakes her head, sadly.

Sethren pats you in a friendly manner.

Sethren Argyle says, "You will learn."

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..why do you carry that dagger, out of curiosity?"

You ponder the situation.

You say, "I don't know, I like it."

Sethren nods his head.

You smirk.

Sethren Argyle says, "Didn't use it to try to defend yourself."

You say, "I thought... it would be useful to have sharp blade..."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say, "Obviously it wasn't quite as useful as I thought."

Sethren Argyle says, "Having hold of your wrists put a damper on that, I
imagine."

You say, "Quite a bit, in fact."

You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.

Sethren Argyle says, "I find..this works quite a bit better."

Sethren licks a needle-pointed dirk.

You say, "Perhaps in your hands, I doubt it would have done me much good,
either."

Sethren Argyle says, "On that note. You shouldn't try to have anyone rescue
you."

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "They will quite swiftly regret it."

You lean over to one side then stand up straight again.

You angrily say, "Not that it matters, your threats. The only person who would
attempt it, I do not have the heart to tell. And he can't fight you anyway."

Sethren Argyle says, "Poor thing..but good, for my purposes."

Sethren smirks.

You glare angrily at Sethren.

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "Just be happy..that I am feeling reasonable at the
moment."

You say, "...reasonable? This.. is reasonable?"

You shiver violently.

"Mhmm," Sethren murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

Sethren Argyle says, "Otherwise I'd have to hurt you to wipe that glare of
yours off your face."

Sethren whispers to you, "You will notice when I'm being unreasonable, worry
not."

Leilani shrinks back into her seat, her eyes losing a bit of their fire,
replaced by icy dread. She lets out a sharp breath, collapsing into her
arms folded across the desk.

Sethren Argyle grins lightly, calmly watching you across the desk.

Sethren ponders you for a moment and says "Hrm..."

Sethren whispers to you, "I know you aren't stupid. I expect that I won't have
to come get you when I return to the realms, that you will come to me."

You give a pained sigh.

You nod slowly.

Sethren Argyle says, "I think I'll be leaving now. Feel free to do what you
wish, but remember what I said."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement at you.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure you will."

You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.

You mutter, "...."

Sethren smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Sethren grows still and his lips begin to move silently.

You peer at Sethren unscrupulously.
