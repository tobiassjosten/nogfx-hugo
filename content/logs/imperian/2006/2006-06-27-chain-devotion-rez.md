agony as his skin suddenly bubbles with gangrenous growths.
The last vestiges of strength having ebbed from Aidan's body, he sinks to the 
floor with a sigh. Suddenly, your surroundings are enveloped in a blinding 
white light, forcing you to cower with your hands over your eyes. When you 
tentatively open them once more, you are astonished to find Aidan alive once 
more.
