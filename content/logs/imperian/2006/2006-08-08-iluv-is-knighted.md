Imperial parade and Via Incola. (City of Stavenn.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Rhav, 
the gatekeeper of Stavenn, examines the workings of the gates' machinery. A 
sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A rumpled
little girl skips about, engaged in a cheerful game of hopscotch.

the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the 
ground. A rumpled little girl skips about, engaged in a cheerful game of

Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles 
listlessly in the wind. There are 12 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. The 
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, 
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with the crest of the 
Empire ripples regally from the columns of the gates. There are 2 monolith 
sigils here. There are 5 Diavlous Knights here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a 
cannon here. He has twelve cannon balls. His hard eyes watching everything, a 
Stavennite constable patrols here. A roan mustang is here, its long, full mane 
flowing freely in the wind. A lean coyote prowls around the forest, his nose 
sniffing along the ground for prey. An ancient and oversized tome stands upon a
regally decorated pedestal here. Blending in with the shadows, a large black 
panther prowls here. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares 
attentively at the surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. Omar Khayyam 
Ravenhurst is here, delirious. Barely more than grinning skull suspended in the
air by ethereal energy, a lost soul floats aimlessly about here. A black 
ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. 
Legouloue is here. She is holding a tower shield in her right hand. Martyr 
Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms is here, giving off a truly ghastly 
stench. He wields a scythe-bladed staff in his left hand and a tower shield in 
his right.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east 
(gate open).

You say, "Does anyone know any Noble Lady?"

You say, "A foreigner that has come to Stavenn."

Legouloue says, "Dagny is a Lady."

You say, "Yes but she is no foreigner."
Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst nods his head.
Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst says, "That is really probably for the best then."

An elegantly dressed Noctusari says, "You mean Lucasta Alcine?"

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms says, "..erana was one.."

You say, "Lucasta Alcine?"

You say to an elegantly dressed Noctusari, "Can you tell me more, brother?"

An elegantly dressed Noctusari says, "She came to Stavenn a long time ago. 
Uppity one."

You say, "I see, where does she stay now?"

An elegantly dressed Noctusari says, "Past the Grand Pagoda."

An elegantly dressed Noctusari says, "Well inside it."

Maglust makes a beckoning motion to no one in particular.

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms says, "I know the way."

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms says, "..I think.."

Maglust ponders the situation.

You say to an elegantly dressed Noctusari, "Thank you for your help."

You give 400 gold sovereigns to an elegantly dressed Noctusari.

You begin to follow Maglust.

You say to Maglust, "Lead the way."

-Maglust leading the way-

An eccentrically decorated sitting room.
Lucasta Alcine stands prim and proper, an air of superiority in her gaze. A 
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A stone tower has been erected 
here in honour of the Griever, remaining true to the influences of ruin in its 
ever-crumbling state. A grey mist hangs in the air around its base, through 
which a serpent of granite and steel is seen constricted about the stone 
blocks. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.
You see a single exit leading west.

You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.

You say to Lucasta Alcine, "Greetings."

probe Lucasta
A wealthy foreigner of fair prestige, Lady Alcine is a vision of straight-laced
femininity. While her porcelain skin and statuesque features immediately strike
one as beautiful, she is similarly as hard and cold as the aforementioned stone
sculptures she models. A high-collared deep violet dress serves as her choice 
of attire, lengths of white lace frill sewn at the neck, sleeves, and base of 
the wide bell skirt. Her ebon hair has been pulled into a rigidly tight bun on 
the back of her head, not a strand unaccounted for. With almond-shaped eyes 
blue as winter ice, she is at once both noble and arrogant.
Lucasta Alcine is not one to be trifled with.
It weighs about 119 pounds.
You see nothing in it.

Lucasta Alcine says, "Greetings."

You say to Lucasta Alcine, "If it ain't too late to say.. Welcome to our fair 
City."

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms smirks slightly.

Lucasta Alcine says, "I've been here for some time but I thank you for the 
welcome. Etiquette is something that is usually lacking these days."

Lucasta Alcine says, "How may I help you?"

You say to Lucasta Alcine, "I'm here to ask about a tiara."

Lucasta Alcine's mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.

Lucasta Alcine says, "Ah, for the little one."

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms smirks slightly.

You say to Lucasta Alcine, "Yes yes!

Your mouth turns up as your face breaks into a smile.

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms says, "The gypsy girl?"

Lucasta Alcine says, "She reminds me so much of my own child..."

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms says, "Her name escapes me.."

You say, "Oh? Where is she?"

Lucasta Alcine says, "She is not to return to me."

You whisper to Maglust, "Paili is the gypsy child."

You nod slowly.

You say to Lucasta Alcine, "My condolences."

Lucasta Alcine says, "I do not dwell on what cannot be. It does make me happy 
to watch little Paili though."

Your mouth turns up as your face breaks into a smile.

You say, "Same here."

Lucasta Alcine says, "I keep the tiara, for the child often loses it. It would 
not do for such a thing to be lost forever."

You say, "Indeed, that's mighty kind of ya."

Lucasta Alcine takes a sparkling object from a nearby jewel box and hands it 
reverently to Iluv.

You say to Lucasta Alcine, "Thank you."

Lucasta Alcine says, "Let her play with it for a time then. Though be sure she 
knights you for it."

Lucasta Alcine smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over her features.

You say to Lucasta Alcine, "I'll take it to her now."

Your mouth turns up as your face breaks into a smile.

Lucasta Alcine nods her head.

You say, "Yes ma'am."

You wave goodbye.

Lucasta Alcine says, "Farewell then."

Maglust bows respectfully to Lucasta Alcine.

You doff your hat cordially.

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms says to Lucasta Alcine, "Be 
well lady alcine."

You follow Maglust to the west.

-Maglust searching for the girl-

Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms says, "Always fun searching for
the girl..."

You say, "I can find her."

You decide to stop following Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms.

Maglust begins to follow you.

You wrinkle your nose and sniff.

You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.

-Me looking for the girl, in the correct places-

Maglust follow you to the north.
Along the Via Incola. (City of Stavenn.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune 
like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A tiny, shadow 
gray kitten is posing regally here, light reflecting from his sparkling collar.
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a 
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A rumpled little girl skips 
about, engaged in a cheerful game of hopscotch.
You see exits leading north, south, and west.

You pat Paili, the gypsy lass in a friendly manner.

You say to Paili, the gypsy lass, "I have something special for you."

You give a mischievous grin.

Paili, the gypsy lass skips about merrily.

Paili, the gypsy lass says, "You got it you got it?"

Paili, the gypsy lass bounces up and down.

You say to Paili, the gypsy lass, "Yes."

Paili, the gypsy lass squeals in excitement.

Paili, the gypsy lass claps her hands together merrily.

You say, "Just a minute."

You give a diamond encrusted tiara to Paili, the gypsy lass.
Tears well up in the corners of Paili's eyes as she gazes at the beautiful 
tiara.
Paili, the gypsy lass exclaims, "Now I'm really a queen. Wait 'till the others 
see this!"

Beaming happily, Paili puts the tiara on her head.

Paili, the gypsy lass says, "For my most loyal servant, I'll give you this 
thing I found earlier."
Paili starts rummaging around in her dirty pockets.

Pulling out a wooden toothpick, Paili hands it to you.

Paili, the gypsy lass grins mischievously.

You say to Paili, the gypsy lass, "Thank you, your Majesty!"

You say to Paili, the gypsy lass, "I will treasure it always."

Paili, the gypsy lass exclaims, "Now I bet stow your knightness!"

Your mouth turns up as your face breaks into a smile.

You say, "Shall I kneel?"
 
Paili, the gypsy lass grins and nods.
 

You kneel before Paili, the gypsy lass, swearing your allegiance to her.
 
Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms flaps his misty wings of shadow
idly , kicking up the silvery mist and momentaily shrouding the area.
 
Paili, the gypsy lass ponders for a minute, and looks around hastily for a 
sword to use.
 
Paili, the gypsy lass says, "I ain't got a sword. So you have to pretend."

You say, "Wait."
 
Paili, the gypsy lass tilts her head curiously.
 
You give a sturdy shortsword to Paili, the gypsy lass.
Paili, the gypsy lass exclaims, "For me?! Great!"
 
Paili, the gypsy lass claps her hands together merrily.

You say, "This should do well."

You say, "Just don't cut me."

You give a mischievous grin.
 
Maglust narrows his eyes and then blinks rapidly, several times.
 
Paili, the gypsy lass wields the shortsword in her right hand, and then extends
her skinny little arm.
 
Paili, the gypsy lass exclaims, "For returning to me my crown jewels, I 
pronounce you...uhm...Sir Iluv, Knight of the Tiara!"
 
Paili, the gypsy lass taps Iluv lightly on each shoulder, slowly and carefully 
as to not cut him.
 
Paili, the gypsy lass says, "You may get up now Sir Iluv."

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.
 
Paili, the gypsy lass stands straight with taut shoulders, a paragon for all to
admire.

Pressing the tips of your fingers one to the other in a steeple at the center 
of your breast, you bow low to Paili, the gypsy lass in respect.

You say, "My Queen."
 
Paili, the gypsy lass whispers to Maglust, "did I do that right?".

You tilt your head and listen intently to Maglust.
 
You gag a bit as Maglust's stink wafts over you.
 
Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms smirks slightly.
 
Maglust gives Paili, the gypsy lass an acknowledging nod.

Paili, the gypsy lass exclaims, "Yay!"
 
Martyr Maglust Argyle, Keeper of Death's Psalms says to Paili, the gypsy lass, 
"Though a queen is never wrong."
 
Maglust grins mischievously.
 
Paili, the gypsy lass says, "Now I'm going to back to my duty of playing."

Paili, the gypsy lass gets down and wiggles them cheeks furiously.

You give Paili, the gypsy lass a respectful salute.
Staring at the sky, Paili does a little dance.
 
Maglust beckons you to him.
