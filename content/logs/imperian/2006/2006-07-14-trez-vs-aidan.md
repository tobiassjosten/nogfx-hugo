Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A small sign points into a market 
stall. The towering presence of Peravus, ancient Caananite seems to dominate 
the room here. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A fearsome lion prowls around 
here and greets you with a warning roar. Gleaming slightly, a sturdy shortsword
is here. A scruffy grey alley cat sits here pointedly ignoring you as it cleans
its fur. A mighty redwood eagle soars through the air here, silent as a whisper
as its eyes focus upon the ground. A banded stallion stands here quietly 
regarding his surroundings. A ruinous hound growls excessively here. Barely 
more than grinning skull suspended in the air by ethereal energy, a lost soul 
floats aimlessly about here. A maidenhair leaf lies here. Lyanth is sitting on 
the ground. Andrei is here.
