A deteriorating road.
A young Norrjin stumbles about here in shock.

A young Norrjin man grabs your arm, a frantic look on his face.

A young Norrjin man exclaims, "Please, you must help me!"

You say, "Help?"

A young Norrjin man wrings his hands as he looks around nervously.

A young Norrjin man exclaims, "All I was trying to do was keep the towne warm, 
I swear it..it's not my fault!"

A young Norrjin man says, "I tried praying to Aida Wedo, spirit of the flames 
to help keep Velin warm during the cold nights."

A young Norrjin man says, "But that spirit of Darkness, Ni'Xoq, he got mad and 
put the towne in constant darkness."

A young Norrjin man looks up, a wretched look on his face.

A young Norrjin man says, "It is cold, we can't harvest anymore, and all the 
plants are dying."

*** You must AGREE MAN to begin your quest ***

You nod your head at a young Norrjin man, showing your acceptance.

A young Norrjin man says, "There are rumours of an old witch who has spent 
decades researching the ways of the Spirits and the various manifestations of 
them."

A young Norrjin man says, "She has worked closely with Valasilh over the years.
I'm sure she could help you."

A young Norrjin man says, "Her name is Meliran, her last known whereabouts is 
the towne of Cetara."

---Walks to Cetara---

A gloomy town square.
A wizened, old witch is here, her eyes reflecting an ancient wisdom.

You greet Meliran, a wizened Witch with a sincere smile.

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Ah, a Diak. I suppose those in Velin angered 
the Spirits again. Which one is it this time?"

You say, "Ni'Xoq."

Meliran, a wizened Witch searches attentively in her old tome, sheet flying by 
quickly under her fingers.

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "There we are! To perform this ritual, you will 
need to gather a few things."

Meliran, a wizened Witch looks about herself, rubbing her chin thoughtfully.

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "You will need a ritual knife, the corpse of a 
goblin, and a moonstone."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Just ask me about each thing to learn more 
about them. Once you have them all, you need to go below and attempt the ritual
to banish the spirit."

You say, "Knife."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Oh Blessed be, I forgot I had it! I could be 
nice enough to give it to you if you answer a few questions correctly for me."

Meliran, a wizened Witch grins mischeviously at you, enjoying the thought that 
you might not be able to answer.

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Are you ready for my questions?"

You say, "Yes."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Ok then, questions it is."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "You seek me when you need help. I am the Head 
of those who help the Diaks, who am I?"

You say, "Lustrum Ducere."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Correct, Lustrum Ducere it is. Next question."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "I am the leader of the Coterie, I ensure the 
laws are known and respected, who am I?"

You say, "Wytchdoktor."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Correct, Wytchdoktor it is. Next question."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "I am your enemy, I am the enemy of the Coterie.
Who am I?"

You say, "Dzungalo."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Correct, Dzungalo it is. Next question."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "I am a traitor, I am one who left the Coterie 
or was kicked out and kept practicing your arts even with the disagreement of 
the Spirits, who am I?"

You say, "Limorasi."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Correct, Limorasi it is. Next question."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "I am the leadership of the Coterie. A group of 
knowledgeable Wytchen who make decisions for the well-being of the Coterie, led
by the Wytchdoktor. What am I?"

You say, "Elder council."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Correct, Council of Elders it is."

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "Your knowledge seems satisfying. I guess you 
have earned that knife."

Meliran, a wizened Witch hands you a rune-etched ritual knife.

You say, "Moonstone."

Meliran, a wizened Witch looks about herself, rubbing her chin thoughtfully.

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "I used to seek out Finhar, the stone collector.
You can find him moving around the beach of Sodiuar Lake more oft than not."

You say, "Goblin"

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "You should be able to find a couple roaming 
along the road out of Caanae, heading towards Kinsarmar."

---Walks to Sodiuar Lake---

Sandy path nearing the beach.
An old stone collector stands here, sorting through a small pouch of stones.

You greet Finhar, the stone collector with a sincere smile.

Finhar, the stone collector looks at you from under his bushy eyebrows.

Finhar, the stone collector says, "You wanting something, Thania?"

You say, "Moonstone."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "I don't just help anyone you know, and 
you're pretty new to the way of the Spirits."

Finhar, the stone collector looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Finhar, the stone collector says, "I reckon I should give you a chance if 
Meliran has gone to the trouble to send you my way."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "To get a moonstone from me, you'll have to 
answer some questions for me. Just let me know when you are ready."

You say, "Ready."

Finhar, the stone collector grunts noncommittally.

Finhar, the stone collector says, "I don't expect you to do well, but the 
questions it is."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Name a city or council a Wytchen should 
never seek citizenship in?"

You say, "Antioch."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Correct, you could have chosen Ithaqua or 
Antioch."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Does the Coterie allow you to kill a fellow 
Wytch -or- hire an assasin to do it for you?"

You say, "No."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Correct, a Wytchen will not act against 
another...period."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Can you bring a Gaje in the Fortress?"

You say, "No."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Correct, at no time are Gaje allowed within 
the Fortress unless by order of the Wytchdoktor."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Let's say you are part of a city. Your city 
is getting raided by many Ithaquans and Antiochians."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Your fellow citymates are being killed in 
large numbers and they call for your help."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "At the very same moment, a Diak on your 
guild channel asks for help. He is lost and blind."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Who would you help first?"

You say, "Diak."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Correct, the Wytchen must always come first,
before all else."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Say one of the things that are vital to the 
purpose of the Wytchen?"

You say, "Freedom."

Finhar, the stone collector says, "Correct this is something vital to the core 
of the Coterie."

Finhar, the stone collector grunts noncommittally.

Finhar, the stone collector says, "You have done far better than I would have 
expected, Thania."

Finhar, the stone collector gives you a look of grudging respect before handing
you a smooth moonstone.

---On the way to Caanae---

The final blow proves too much for a goblin scout, who expires, pitifully.
You pick up the corpse of a goblin scout.

A path skirting the Celidon.
A limorasi lurks here, barely discernable from the shadows.

---Continues to walk, direction Cetara---

A limorasi appears from the shadows, beckoning to you.

An exiled limorasi says, "Me and you, we could do some fine work in Velin, I'm 
told they are having troubles, what you say?"

Caressing the vodun doll in his hand, a limorasi fades into the shadows.

---A bit later...---

An exiled limorasi tells you, "Psst, you..come here."

An exiled limorasi says, "I heard rumours of you helping Velin with their curse
of darkness. Don't suppose you want some help?"

---Back in Cetara.---

You greet Meliran, a wizened Witch with a sincere smile.

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "You will need this scroll, it outlays the 
ritual steps you must follow. You should have no trouble opening the door 
leading down from the townesquare, Thania."

A dimly lit vestibule.
A circle of crystalline salt lies here, the mark of a Wytchen ritual.

You read what is written on a leather scroll:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You must enter the vestibule that is down from the Towne Square here in
Cetara. Once you are within it, you must follow these steps precisely,
ignoring steps, or bypassing them will prove to be fruitless.

1 - Put moonstone in the circle of salt.
2 - Put the corpse over the goblin in the circle of salt so it is
positioned over the moonstone.
3 - Drop an unlit white candle on the floor near the top of the circle.
4 - Once these things are in place, recite the following lines, one line
at a time.
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
I call upon Bax to protect me during this ritual
I call upon Aida Wedo to enlight my path and those of the villagers
I call upon you, Ni'Xoq to present yourself before me, now
In this moonstone you will enter
In this moonstone like a prisoner you will rest.

5 - Drop knife so that it pierces the corpse of the goblin and embeds in
the moonstone
6 - If you are successful, the darkness will be absorbed into the
moonstone. Pick it up and return to Meliran.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You put an iridescent moonstone into a salt circle.
The moonstone falls in the center of the ritual salt circle, the candle light 
casting a soft glow over it.

You put the corpse of a common goblin into a salt circle.
The corpse of a goblin falls directly over the moonstone, hiding it from view.

You give a nod of satisfaction as you place the candle on the floor at the top 
of the circle.

You say, "I call upon Bax to protect me during this ritual."

A soft voice whispers to your ears: " I am here, Thania. Do not be afraid, I 
will protect you should this go wrong."

You say, "I call upon Aida Wedo to enlight my path and those of the villagers."

The white candle suddenly flickers and takes flame, casting a soft glow over 
the ritual circle.

You say, "I call upon you, Ni'Xoq to present yourself before me, now."

The flames on the candles flare as a ghostly form of darkness seems to rise up 
within the circle.

You say, "In this moonstone you will enter."

You say, "In this moonstone like a prisoner you will rest."

You say, "There is no way you can escape."

You say, "Lift the curse upon this village."

You say, "Or should your existance be naught."

As you drop the knife, it slices through the goblin and buries it tip into the 
moonstone beneath it.

The goblin's blood begins to ooze over the moonstone, some seeming to seep into
the stone itself while the rest pools around it.

A howl of rage sounds from the pool of darkness as it begins to twist in a 
whirlwind and is drawn into the moonstone.

You pick up an iridescent moonstone.

---Goes back to Meliran.---

You greet Meliran, a wizened Witch with a sincere smile.

Meliran, a wizened Witch exclaims, "You have done well Thania!"

Meliran, a wizened Witch says, "You will want to take the moonstone to the 
young Norrjin who asked for your help."

---And runs back to Caanae.---

You give an iridescent moonstone to a young Norrjin man.

A young Norrjin man exclaims, "You have done it Thania!"

The young Norrjin snaps his fingers and he seems to change before your very 
eyes, as if he had been concealed within camouflage.

A Wytchen elder's eyes twinkle enchantingly.

A Wytchen elder says, "You have done well Diak, Thania, very well indeed."

A Wytchen elder says, "The young Norrjin originally seeking your help has 
returned to Velin to make sure all is well, for we sensed your success."

A Wytchen elder says, "To complete your quests as a Diak, you must repeat the 
following vow after me."

A Wytchen elder says, "Spirits, hear me here and now"

You say, "Spirits, hear me here and now."

A Wytchen elder says, "I've come to take the Wytch's vow."

You say, "I've come to take the Wytch's vow."

A Wytchen elder says, "Bear me witness that all might know."

You say, "Bear me witness that all might know."
 
A Wytchen elder says, "This vow rings true within my soul."

You say, "This vow rings true within my soul."

A Wytchen elder says, "Sacred will I keep the Arts."

You say, "Sacred will I keep the Arts."

A Wytchen elder says, "Our laws I'll hold close to my heart."

You say, "Our laws I'll hold close to my heart."

A Wytchen elder says, "The ancient spirits I'll respect."

You say, "The ancient spirits I'll respect."

A Wytchen elder says, "My fellow Wytchen I'll protect."

You say, "My fellow Wytchen I'll protect."

A Wytchen elder says, "I'll serve unto my dying breath."

You say, "I'll serve unto my dying breath."

A Wytchen elder says, "And join the Spirits in my death."

You say, "And join the Spirits in my death."

A Wytchen elder says, "So do I swear the Wytch's Vow."

You say, "So do I swear the Wytch's Vow."

A Wytchen elder says, "Spirits, Wytchen, hear me now."

You say, "Spirits, Wytchen, hear me now."

A Wytchen elder says, "I swear to serve the Coterie."

You say, "I swear to serve the Coterie."

A Wytchen elder says, "As the Wytchen will it, so mote it be."

You say, "As the Wytchen will it, so mote it be."

A Wytchen elder bows respectfully to you.

A Wytchen elder says, "And so it shall be, you may now seek Valasilh within the
Fortress."

When you see Valasilh ASK VALASILH PROMOTE to advance out of novicehood, be 
sure you have met all the necessary guild requirements before doing so.

With a quick bow, an elder Wytchen departs.
