You lash out with your whip and drag Hiroshi into the room.

You thrust your arm out, striking at Hiroshi.
You connect!

"Ouch!", Hiroshi shrieks in pain.

You say, "Sit."

"Ok!" Hiroshi exclaims.

Hiroshi sits down.

Azlyn thrusts his foot forward striking you in the chest and pinning you to the ground.

You whisper to Hiroshi, "In your oath, you swore to respect your fellow Saboteurs."

You whisper to Hiroshi, "You do not mock any of them, not about combat ability,
not about anything."

You whisper to Hiroshi, "You just did it right infront of me to Sarrius..."

Hiroshi Devilen says, "I was only playing, he has been helping ne."

Hiroshi Devilen says, "I didn't mean to mock, on tease."

You whisper to Hiroshi, "He doesn't seem to think your 'playing', and it didn't
come off that way to me either."

You whisper to Hiroshi, "Watch your words, and your actions Hiroshi."

Hiroshi Devilen says, "Well I will contact him and apologize. I was in the
wrong if he feels that way."

Azlyn removes his foot from your chest, allowing you to breath properly again.

You say, "On your feet."

Hiroshi stands up from the ground.
