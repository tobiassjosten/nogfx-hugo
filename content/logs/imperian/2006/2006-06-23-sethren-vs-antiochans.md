An obscure path off the river's edge. (road). (Renfrewshire swamp.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Water 
flows slowly down this submerged path, agitating particles of dirt and sand so 
that everything beneath the surface is cloudy. Only the feel of laid stone and 
grit indicates the path that lies here, a slight mist hovering over the surface
of the muggy water. The land slants gradually down, water trickling amongst 
cloudy particles of grit and swirling masses of plant life. A small opening can
be seen to the east, tiny wisps of mist escaping into the air. A Seraphic 
guardian is here, slowly pulsating with the hot white light of a desert sun. 
The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Eyeing you 
defiantly, a brown brawny stallion exhibits its large body. Zealous Angel, Olyn
Ashtear is here. He wields a Mace of Vahin in his left hand and a Shield of the
Protector in his right. The Great Bear, Stavros Ruadh Ftero, The Hammer of Law 
is here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in his left hand and a strong broadsword
in his right. Kliko Ashtear is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand 
and a spiritual mace in his right. Mu'tah Arlougre is here. He wields a strong 
broadsword in his left hand and a banded shield in his right.

breast. The Seraph's eyes roll back in its head and as your soul is torn 
screaming from your body, you collapse to the ground in neverending, inhuman 
pain.
You have been slain by Olyn.
