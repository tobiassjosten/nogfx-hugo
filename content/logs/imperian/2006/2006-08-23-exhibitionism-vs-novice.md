Vrodis tells you, "Now i have a question...what does this mean 
exactly: Moranasai grabs your hips, starting to thrust faster, rocking against 
your body, biting into his lower lips to keep quiet, thrusting himself deep and
hard into your soft depths, shivering madly? Is this really...that?"

Vrodis tells you, "It happened just after appearing under 
aryana's spring..."

(Recruits): You say, "That means he really likes you."

&lt;At this point I am laughing so hard that all I can do is copy and paste the tell to DK and CG. Ashel 
gets a spider, walks in under the springs where they were mudsexing and animates it right there.&gt;

Moranasai has perished from the deadly toxins of undead remains of a large 
spider.

Ruchira has perished from the deadly toxins of undead remains of a large 
spider.

&lt;When they get back from Dis I am able to control my laughing and tell Moranasai over Stavenn CT that I'm 
going to vivisect him out of the city if he does that in public again. He qq's in embarassment and is 
never seen or heard from again.&gt;
