Background:

Sethren and I were randomly babbling about ways to make our characters more interesting as we were both extremely bored on the RP front of late. I've been wanting to do some darker RP for awhile, and we decided to go for this. We plotted a basic overview, but most of this crap has been spur of the moment. Much fun.
QUOTE

Under the banana trees. (Ruins of n'Aryanvella.)

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. There are 2 banana trees here.

You see exits leading south and west.

Sethren emerges from his hiding place.

You blink.

Sethren grins mischievously.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hello."

You tilt your head curiously.

Sethren Argyle says, "Don't worry, I was only following you for a bit."

You ponder the situation.

You smile impishly and say, "Following me? Must have been rather boring."

"Heh heh heh," Sethren chuckles.

Sethren Argyle says, "No, not too bad."

Leilani leans back against the tree, tucking her books into her pack.

Sethren Argyle says, "Was wondering if I was going to have to come out and help
you with S'telmas."

You give a mischievous grin.

You say, "The obnoxious zealot, you mean?"

Sethren nods his head.

Sethren Argyle says, "Is there any other kind?"

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You smile with a wink and say, "Eh, he's harmless as a kitten. You know the
kind that bite you randomly when you start petting them."

"Mhmm," Sethren murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

You smile impishly and say, "I can run fast when the need arises."

He is a serpentine Ssylsin and is very tall, seeming almost gaunt. He appears
full of energy, like a coiled spring waiting to be released. Crimson scales
cover his lithe body, and his tail swings slowly behind him, of its own
volition. His eyes are a deep black, showing currents of varying emotions
behind them. His face is rather long, his cheeks shallow, and a forked tongue
flicks out from between his lips intermittently. A scar in the shape of an "X"
is visible on the back of his left hand. He is wearing a formal black collared
shirt, a tattoo of a unicursal hexagram, a deck of Tarot cards, a pair of
fingerless, black leather gloves, a simple ring of silver, a suit of scale
mail, a dark crimson pouch, a bloodstone ring of the Malignists, a ring of
pestilence, a plain ring, an Imperial ring of the Ephors, a sinuous silver
snake bracelet, a silver ring etched with hearts, handsome, black tailored
pants, a thick platinum and emerald band, and a bloodstained leather satchel.
He wields a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand and a tower shield in his
right.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure you don't need to entirely too often."

You say, "We have met before, you helped me find Malkav's grove, I believe."

You ponder the situation.

Comprehension flashes across Sethren's face.

Sethren Argyle says, "I did remember you, I just wasn't sure from what."

You nod your head.

Sethren Argyle says, "Followed you out of curiosity."

You smile impishly and say, "I remember you. Your wife made me an interesting
offer, once."

Sethren smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

You say, "I don't exactly talk to many people either, hard to forget a face."

Sethren Argyle says, "What are you up to out here?"

Sethren tilts his head curiously.

You say, "I like it here, it's quiet..."

You say, "Nothing to distract me from my books."

Sethren Argyle says, "Except random people shadowing you."

Your eyes twinkle enchantingly.

Sethren smirks.

You say, "There is that."

You say, "You must have an incredibly dull life to follow me."

You smile impishly and say, "I am certain there are many more interesting
people."

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..not exactly."

Your eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "You're rather intriguing to me."

You blush furiously.

You say, "Erhm...why?"

Sethren Argyle says, "Not exactly sure. Just something about you."

Sethren Argyle says, "Maybe because you seem so quiet. Rare these days.."

Sethren ponders the situation.

Leilani frowns slightly, suddenly very focused on the papaya in her hands. "This... is true, I suppose," she whispers, as she drags a long fingernail into the flesh of the fruit.

Sethren Argyle eyes you curiously, watching your every movement. "Is something
wrong?"

Sethren Argyle swishes his tail slowly back and forth.

Leilani slowly peels back the thick skin of the papaya, the frown slowly easing to be replaced by a thoughtful look. "I am not used to such attention, or being followed into secluded jungles," she whispers, with a wry grin.

Sethren Argyle says, "I doubt many are used to it."

You smile impishly and say, "Probably quite true. I would not know. I do not do
much following about."

Sethren nods his head.

Sethren Argyle says, "You'd rather stick to your books?"

Leilani smiles broadly, "Books are safe... erhm... I mean... they bring me
pleasure with no complications," she says in a rush. Her smile fading as she
stumbles over her words, her face flushed as she stops speaking.

Sethren Argyle tilts his head as she stops speaking. "Well..perhaps this
meeting can be fortunate?" He makes a sudden movement to wrap his tail very
lightly around her, pulling her a little bit closer. "I would think..I could be
a little more interesting than books."


Leilani blushes brightly, gasping in surprise as he pulls her closer. She ducks
quickly away, and runs off without a word.

You shiver violently.

You collapse in a heap on the floor, unwilling to bear the pain any longer.

Sethren moves over to block the west exit.

Sethren Argyle says, "There you are."

Sethren Argyle tilts his head curiously at you, his tail swaying behind him.
"Wasn't expecting you to run away like that...".

Leilani whimpers, growing very pale as she backs quickly away from you.

Sethren Argyle says, "You know why.."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Sethren Argyle says, "I don't much like when people run away from me."

Leilani glances around looking for a way to get around you, whispering in a
panicked tone, "I... I am not... used to people touching me. I meant you ...
no offense." She clutches her tome tightly to her chest as she suddenly tries
to push her way around you.

Sethren stops you from moving that way.

Sethren Argyle wraps his tail around you now that you can't get away. He pulls
you closer to him, taking hold of your wrist to keep you still. "Hm..just as
interesting as I thought, then.".

Leilani beings to tremble, biting down on her lower lip. "Please, Sir, let me
go. I don't know why you find me so interesting... I assure you I am not. Just
let me go..."

Sethren Argyle grins slightly, whispering to you, "I think..." At his he moves
his tail to one of your legs, pulling it out from under you and sending you to
the ground, his hold on your wrist still firm. "..not."

Leilani yelps as she lands hard on the ground, instantly trying to scramble away.
Finding herself trapped beneath you she moves to slap you as hard as she can,
kicking her feet hard against he ground in an attempt to slip from your grasp.

Sethren Argyle responds by reaching out and catching your other wrist. He
smirks slightly, crouching down next to you and tightening his grip on both
wrists, a bit painfully. "I would not advise attempting to escape, at the
moment. I wouldn't want to hurt you.".

Leilani grows very pale at your words, trembling violently as she begins to
plead with you, "Please... just let me go. I didn't do anything to you, why
are you doing this?" Her eyes fill with tears that threaten to burst forth
at any moment as she wriggles a bit beneath you, testing your grip on her
wrists.

Sethren Argyle continues watching you intently, his eyes sparkling with
amusement. "Why am I doing this? Well..I was sure I could convince you to
return my..interest. But now that you will not, for whatever reason..I think I
will just claim you anyway."

Leilani growls, a passionate rage flaring up in her eyes at your words, she
begins to struggle violently again. Trying her hardest to wrest her arms from
your tight grip, kicking her legs as hard as she can as she screams at you,
"I am not property to be claimed! I am a free woman. You can't just kidnap
people, what is wrong with you! Let me go now!"

Sethren Argyle smirks slightly again, his eyes growing cold. Letting go of one
of your wrists, he slaps you with full force across the face, his claws digging
shallow scratches in your skin. "I told you not to try to get away..but, no
matter. You'll learn yet.".

Leilani cries out, the hard slap unexpected stilling her quickly. She seems
to shrink beneath you, the tears finally bursting free as she begins to sob
quietly. "You can't... keep me here... forever you now. What do you want with
me...." she whimpers, her salty tears stinging the scratches in her throbbing
flesh.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..well. I could keep you here for as long as I wanted,
really. But I have no need to. And what do I want? Well..you."

Sethren Argyle has hold of both your wrists again, though not as tightly
because you seem less likely to struggle.

Sethren gazes intently at you, his forked tongue flickering inquisitively.

Leilani sniffles softly, staring up at you with a face stained with tears.
She whispers softly, "You can't just... take people. That's just not how it
works. Please... please let me go." Her trembling seems to calm as
she shifts her wrists a bit, attempting to ease her discomfort a bit.

Sethren Argyle grins in response, whispering back to you, "Mm..well, I don't
know about other people. But I certainly can. If I so wish..you will never be
able to escape me. However, with luck you will grow to not desire to leave
me."

Sethren Argyle swishes his tail leisurely back and forth, giving the appearance
of being relaxed.

Leilani glares up at you, "I highly doubt that," she hisses. Her eyes flash
hatred in your direction, as she takes attempts to take advantage of your
seeming relaxation to fight against you once more, jerking hard on her arms
and kicking up, twisting her body in an attempt to crawl away.

Sethren Argyle frowns slightly, "And here I thought you were coming to accept
it." Swiftly, he shoves you back onto the ground, his tail restraining you as
well. He pins you down beneath him, moving one hand to cover your mouth and
nose, entirely blocking off your breathing. "I won't have you escaping me..if
you promise you won't try to run away, I'll let you breathe. Nod your head if
you promise.."

Leilani freezes up instantly as you pin her down, her eyes growing wide at your
words. She quickly nods her head, as she struggles to draw breath beneath you.

Sethren Argyle smiles wryly, surprised at you giving in so quickly. He looks
curiously at you, deciding if you'll keep it. He seems to make a decision,
moving his hand away. "Now..if you break your promise, you will deeply regret
it. Keep that in mind."

Sethren whispers to you, "I think you're learning already."

You blush furiously.

Sethren Argyle says, "Are you going to try to escape on me?"

Sethren tilts his head curiously.

You shake your head.

You whisper to Sethren, "Please, if I promise not to run, will you let me sit
up?"

Sethren Argyle nods, moving back to his crouching position and off of you. He
keeps one of your hands tightly in his grasp, whispering to you, "You can't be
entirely trusted..yet."

Leilani raises herself slowly off the ground, watching you suspiciously for any
sign of movement. After she sits up, she wipes the tears from her face, and
brushes the dust from her clothing. She draws in a deep and shaky breath,
sitting up straight, "I... think you've proven that I cannot escape... at
the moment, at least." she whispers softly, frowning as she stares at the
ground in front of her feet. "Now what...do we do?" she asks quietly.

Sethren Argyle stretches slowly, returning to watching you intently. "Well, now
that you're calmer, it's much simpler. I suppose that we could return to the
city now...You do need to keep something in mind, though. You are mine, now. If
you escape I will catch you, and you will regret you ever -thought- to escape.
You know that isn't just an empty threat, don't you?"

Sethren tilts his head curiously.

Leilani blushes brightly, rubbing the side of her face gingerly. "I believe
you will make good on that threat, yes," she answers grumpily.

Sethren Argyle smiles brightly. "Good! Now. If we return to the city, will you
try to get away from me? Keep in mind..it is -my- city, the guards will not
help you."

You give a pained sigh.

You say, "I do not have much of a choice, do I?"

Sethren Argyle says, "You do not."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You frown and say, "Is there no way for you to be talked out of this? I am not
a slave, I am a free woman. Is not there a woman who would willingly cling to
your side?"

Sethren Argyle says, "There is no way. And I imagine there are plenty, but I do
not want them. I want -you-."

Sethren Argyle says, "Willing..isn't quite so fun."

Leilani slumps down, muttering, "Fine, I will follow you into the city. I do not
fancy more injuries." She glares at the hand you hold. "Am I allowed to stand,
then?" she asks, her head tilted up slightly as she glares at you, contempt
lacing her words.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..allowed?"

Sethren snaps his fingers in front of you.

You stand up and stretch your arms out wide.

You blush furiously.

You begin to follow Sethren.

Sethren smirks.

You say, "...How... did you do that?"

You blink.

Sethren Argyle says, "I can turn your mind against you, what chance do you
have?"

Sethren swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Sethren Argyle says, "I simply put you under hypnosis while you were
unaware..fairly easy task."

Sethren Argyle says, "Perhaps you will see more of that later."

Sethren pats you in a friendly manner.

Leilani shivers violently, her flushed face growing very pale
as she stares down at her rebellious limbs.

-walk to the city-

A dim study in the Academy. (lost) (City of Stavenn.)
The back room of the Academy is shaped like a half-circle. The ceiling is flat,
and where the wall meets has marbleized molding of battles. Six columns
protrude from the wall, each crafted in the shape of an ominous, hooded figure.
Silver braziers take up the spaces between all of the columns, illuminating the
dark chamber with their golden light. The floor underfoot is the same crimson
marble with golden and white veins as decorates the entrance, and is also as
well-polished. A small bookcase rests against the flat wall near the door. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A carved stone bowl rests here,
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. An elegantly crafted
desk of charred redwood rests in a corner. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A beautifully rendered tarot card has
been discarded. Sethren Argyle is here. He wields a needle-pointed dirk in his
left hand and a tower shield in his right.

You see exits leading southeast and southwest.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..interesting. You didn't try to run."

Sethren Argyle says, "But of course..there's still that contempt in your eyes.
Will have to get rid of that.."

Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.

You angrily say, "You would hunt me down, you are watching and waiting for me
to do so. It would have been a foolish thing to do. I can still feel the
results of my last foolish action."

Sethren Argyle says, "You are learning very quickly. It would indeed be a bad
idea to escape."

You mutter, "For now."

Sethren smirks.

Sethren Argyle says, "I almost wish you did try..there's some things I've been
wanting to experiment with."

Sethren whispers to you, "If you don't believe me..it matters not. But I will
bend you to my will, in time. Eventually you will not even think of trying to
escape. You will enjoy being mine."

Leilani grows pale, backing slowly away from you, "I do not wish to partake of
your... experiments. And I think you are mistaken in that assumption, Sir,"
she growls, attempting to put herself on the far side of the desk from you.

Sethren Argyle tilts his head curiously, making no move to grab you. "That
wouldn't be you doing something foolish again, would it? I do wonder what you
hope to accomplish..".

Leilani closes her eyes for a long moment, her shoulders slumping down dejectedly.
She collapses into the chair beside the desk, laying her head on her arms on its
flat surface. She simply lays there silently for several long minutes. Finally,
she raises her head, meeting your gaze.

You whisper to Sethren, "I will behave, for now. I do not have much of a choice
at the moment. I do not hold my chances to be very good in attempting to escape
you here, in the city you have spent your life in. I can barely find my way to
the tavern. I do not have many options but to submit, for the moment."

Sethren Argyle sits down on the edge of the desk, nodding slowly.

Sethren whispers to you, "A wise decision. I do like how you keep saying "At
the moment", though. It's..cute."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement at you.

Leilani blushes brightly, staring intently at the desktop.

Sethren Argyle reaches over and strokes your hair with an odd tenderness, in
contrast with the violence of before.

Leilani glances warily up at you, confusion written on her face. After a bit
she closes her eyes, sighing heavily.

Sethren whispers to you, "Don't worry too much..it won't be all bad. I am quite
sure you'll grow to like it, in fact."

Leilani shakes her head, sadly.

Sethren pats you in a friendly manner.

Sethren Argyle says, "You will learn."

Sethren Argyle says, "Hm..why do you carry that dagger, out of curiosity?"

You ponder the situation.

You say, "I don't know, I like it."

Sethren nods his head.

You smirk.

Sethren Argyle says, "Didn't use it to try to defend yourself."

You say, "I thought... it would be useful to have sharp blade..."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say, "Obviously it wasn't quite as useful as I thought."

Sethren Argyle says, "Having hold of your wrists put a damper on that, I
imagine."

You say, "Quite a bit, in fact."

You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.

Sethren Argyle says, "I find..this works quite a bit better."

Sethren licks a needle-pointed dirk.

You say, "Perhaps in your hands, I doubt it would have done me much good,
either."

Sethren Argyle says, "On that note. You shouldn't try to have anyone rescue
you."

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "They will quite swiftly regret it."

You lean over to one side then stand up straight again.

You angrily say, "Not that it matters, your threats. The only person who would
attempt it, I do not have the heart to tell. And he can't fight you anyway."

Sethren Argyle says, "Poor thing..but good, for my purposes."

Sethren smirks.

You glare angrily at Sethren.

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "Just be happy..that I am feeling reasonable at the
moment."

You say, "...reasonable? This.. is reasonable?"

You shiver violently.

"Mhmm," Sethren murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

Sethren Argyle says, "Otherwise I'd have to hurt you to wipe that glare of
yours off your face."

Sethren whispers to you, "You will notice when I'm being unreasonable, worry
not."

Leilani shrinks back into her seat, her eyes losing a bit of their fire,
replaced by icy dread. She lets out a sharp breath, collapsing into her
arms folded across the desk.

Sethren Argyle grins lightly, calmly watching you across the desk.

Sethren ponders you for a moment and says "Hrm..."

Sethren whispers to you, "I know you aren't stupid. I expect that I won't have
to come get you when I return to the realms, that you will come to me."

You give a pained sigh.

You nod slowly.

Sethren Argyle says, "I think I'll be leaving now. Feel free to do what you
wish, but remember what I said."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement at you.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure you will."

You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.

You mutter, "...."

Sethren smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.

Sethren grows still and his lips begin to move silently.

You peer at Sethren unscrupulously.

Her next encounter with Sethren

QUOTE
Leilani idly looks through the books on the shelf, occasionally taking one off
the shelf and skimming through its pages.

Mathardan, the Loresage frowns slightly as he finds a book out of place, and
pops it back in.

You crease your brow in a frown.

A quiet alcove. (ruins of Caanae.)

You see a single exit leading north.
You reach over and give a candelabra a firm pull, and it tilts forward slightly
with a creak. A loud screeching noise echoes about the room, and a large slab
of the marble floor slides away in a cloud of dust, revealing steps leading
down.
Decaying hidden archives. (lost)
You see a single exit leading up.

A candelabra next to you raises slightly, creaking as it does, and the exit
leading upwards is sealed

You give a pained sigh.

You take a seat on a comfortable rope hammock.

Sethren ripples into existence before you.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hello."

You blink.

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You angrily say, "... It probably wouldn't help if I asked you to leave, would
it."

You stand up from a comfortable rope hammock.

Sethren Argyle says, "No."

Sethren Argyle says, "Did you think you could hide?"

Sethren gazes intently at you, his forked tongue flickering inquisitively.

Leilani sighs unhappily, her hands nervously smoothing down the material of
her skirt. "That was the general idea," she whispers softly.

Sethren Argyle wraps his tail lightly around you, pulling you up close to him
but not restraining much.

Sethren Argyle says, "I suppose I don't blame you too much. Hm..not yet,
anyway."

Leilani stiffens the instant she feels your tail against her, she steps
back quickly, moving out of your reach, hissing angrily at you.

You angrily say, "Why can't you leave me be!"

Sethren Argyle says, "Because..you're mine. It's my right to do as I will with
you."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "What do you think continuing to fight it will
accomplish?"

Leilani flashes a smoldering glare at you, her fists balling up in rage,
but she stays silent.

Sethren Argyle moves closer to you and takes hold of both of your shoulders. In
one smooth motion he shoves you down to your knees in front of him, not being
at all gentle. "There..that's better.".

Leilani yelps in surprise as she is shoved roughly to her knees, her face
flushing a bright red. Immediately she moves to stand, even more outraged
than she was a moment before, nearly panting in her fury.

Sethren Argyle keeps his hands at your shoulders, and coils his tail tightly
around your waist, holding you where you are. "Mm..stop that.".

Leilani glowers up at you. Without warning she raises her arm,
gripping her dagger in a white-knuckled hand, she lashes out at your
midsection, attempting to throw herself to the side at the same moment.

Sethren Argyle quickly catches that wrist in one hand, gripping it hard enough
to bruise. With the other hand he harshly backhands you across the face, enough
to knock you down if you weren't restrained. He hisses, anger evident in his
eyes for the first time, "I TOLD you to stop that."

Leilani blinks back tears as the impact of the slap sends a burst of white hot
pain through her. The knife clatters loudly to the ground as her fingers stop
obeying her command to hold it. She kneels before you, stunned to silence,
trembling like a frightened rabbit.

You drop a long, sharp dagger.

Sethren Argyle bends down just enough to pick up the dagger, still holding you
down securely. He glares at you, "I see that you aren't learning as quickly as
I thought. You were hoping to hurt me, weren't you? That was a very..foolish
thing to do." He takes your other wrist in his hand, tightening his hold on
both, as he's obviously still angry.

Leilani pales visibly, her trembling only increasing as fear slowly replaces
the rage in her eyes. She simply stares at the ground in front of her knees,
silent tears streaming down her face.

Sethren Argyle coils his tail a little tighter yet, it becoming quite
uncomfortable now. "So..what do you say? Do I have to hurt you more? I quite
enjoy it, I think..so it doesn't matter to me." He smirks, "And I'll take
silence as a yes."

Leilani whimpers, trying in vain to pull her wrists out of your grasp,
"Please... please don't hurt me anymore" she pleads, finally looking up
to catch your gaze.

Sethren Argyle nods slowly, releasing your wrists and watching you closely for
any attempt to escape. "I'm glad you saw the smart thing to do. Perhaps it cana
be easier now?" He smiles and strokes your hair lightly, his anger fading
somewhat.

Leilani frowns slightly, her gaze directed once more to the floor. Confusion is
etched on her face at your sudden change of temperament. "What... what do you
want from me, now?" she whispers quietly.

Sethren Argyle says, "I simply wish for your obedience. This will be much
easier for you if you simply..accept it."

Leilani shakes her head, "How can you expect me to accept obedience? You have
kidnapped me, you have hurt me, why would I harbor anything but hatred for you?"
she growls, rubbing her wrist gingerly.

Sethren Argyle crouches down next to you, stroking your reddened cheek lightly.
"Because I am your Master..and that isn't going to change. Fighting it is
useless. You will learn that in time." He eyes the collar around your neck,
"Hm..will have to get you a new one, that one seems flimsy."

Leilani blushes brightly, her hand moving instantly to the collar around her
neck as she turns her head away from your unexpectedly tender caress.

Sethren Argyle ponders for a moment, quickly unclasping the collar and removing
it. "You will have a replacement soon. You don't need to be wearing one that
doesn't remind you of me." He grins slightly, putting the collar away in his
satchel.

Leilani whimpers as her hand moves over the suddenly bare flesh around her neck,
a deep frown etched on her face, "That... was a gift from my mentor..." she trails
off, her shoulders slumping dejectedly.

Sethren whispers to you, "Then perhaps eventually I will reward you with its
return."

Sethren Argyle says, "Now, I need to be leaving for a bit, I'm afraid."

Sethren Argyle says, "If you're here when I return, I expect you to come to me
without me asking. Or I'll have to hurt you further."

Sethren swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

You whimper like a wounded puppy.

You frown and say, "...I'll come."

Sethren Argyle says, "You may do as you wish until then."

Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.

You give a snake-like hiss.

QUOTE
Your ally, Sethren Argyle, has entered Imperian.

-wanders off to find him-

Imperial Parade nearing the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Bearing
the Imperial seal of Stavenn, a black marble bench is here. A sigil in the
shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A kohdon scout stands
here eyeing his surroundings with an impassionated stare. A menacing mahogany
chair sprouts from the floor here like a leafless barren tree. A short-legged
and chunky hound sniffs at the air here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a cannon
here. He has forty cannon balls.
You see exits leading east, west (open door), and northwest.

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You glare angrily at Sethren.

Sethren whispers to you, "Good girl."

Sethren smiles pleasantly at you, his tail swinging slowly behind him.

You whisper to Sethren, "I did not feel like being slapped around again, it
does not mean I am seeking your company for my own pleasure."

You growl menacingly.

Sethren beckons you to him.

You begin to follow Sethren.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure."

Sethren smirks.

You follow Sethren to the northwest.

-wandering-

A dim study in the Academy. (City of Stavenn.)
The back room of the Academy is shaped like a half-circle. The ceiling is flat,
and where the wall meets has marbleized molding of battles. Six columns
protrude from the wall, each crafted in the shape of an ominous, hooded figure.
Silver braziers take up the spaces between all of the columns, illuminating the
dark chamber with their golden light. The floor underfoot is the same crimson
marble with golden and white veins as decorates the entrance, and is also as
well-polished. A small bookcase rests against the flat wall near the door. A
runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A carved stone bowl rests here,
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. An elegantly crafted
desk of charred redwood rests in a corner. A sigil in the shape of a small,
rectangular monolith is on the ground. A partially-burnt letter has been left
here carelessly.
You see exits leading southeast and southwest.

Sethren takes a seat on an elegant desk.

Sethren Argyle says, "Somewhat surprised that you did come, though."

Leilani leans against the bookcase, her hands folded neatly in
front of her back, glaring miserably at you.

Sethren Argyle says, "You've been so stubborn up to this point."

Sethren creases his brow in a frown.

You say, "I am stubborn, but I am not stupid. You can find me, do not think I
have accepted your supposed ownership of me. I simply have no wish to be
injured. Eventually I will find the way to remove your disturbing presence from
my life."

"Mhmm," Sethren murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

Sethren Argyle says, "Sure you will."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "So..you won't give up yet, hm? I won't even bother
asking."

Sethren Argyle says, "I will change that soon enough."

Leilani grumbles under her breath, her fingertips brushing the
newly bared skin at her neck without thinking as she stares hard at the
ceiling.

Sethren Argyle stands up slowly, moving closer and taking hold of the pendant
around your neck. "Hm..from the Wytchen, isn't it?"

Leilani presses back hard against the bookcase, shrinking away
from your touch, "...yes, why?" she whispers in a suspicious tone.

Sethren Argyle swishes his tail slowly back and forth, "Are you still a
Wytch?"

You ponder the situation.

Sethren Argyle says, "I simply wish to know more about you, nothing to worry
about."

You say, "I am still a wytch, I am no longer a member of the pathetic guild who
claims that name."

Sethren nods his head.

Sethren Argyle says, "I've heard quite a few speak of the guild in that way."

You frown and say, "With good reason, I am sure."

Sethren Argyle says, "But..hm..something I was going to do either way."

Sethren Argyle says, "Take off the pendant."

You say, "...no."

You say, "Why?"

You peer at Sethren unscrupulously.

Sethren Argyle says, "Give it to me."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "Or I'll just take it."

You say, "I do not wish to. It is a symbol of who I am. Why do you need it?"

You growl menacingly.

Sethren Argyle says, "Because you have no need of such symbols."

Sethren Argyle says, "You are mine. That is all you are."

You narrow your eyes to thin slits.

You say, "I will not give it to you, it belongs to me."

Sethren Argyle grins slightly, "I was hoping you would say that.." Without
warning he takes hold of the pendant again, yanking it from your neck and
breaking the chain.

Leilani gasps, clutching desperately where the pendant hangs,
too late to save it from your grasping fingers. She blinks rapidly, holding
back her tears stubbornly. She glares up at you, reaching up a hand to slap you
hard across the face.

You exclaim, "You are nothing but a bully. I do not belong to you, stop
treating me this way!"

Sethren Argyle blinks as the slap catches him off guard and makes contact. He
smirks, responding by shoving you against the wall hard, his weight keeping you
pressed up against it. "I love getting those sort of reactions out of
you..though I'm surprised you thought to do that."

Leilani shakes with rage, a satisfied glint reaching her eyes
as her hand makes contact against your face. She winces as she feels the
bookshelf slamming against her already sore body, causing her to draw in a
sharp breath. She growls angrily at your words, her entire form trembling
visibly as she tries to push out from beneath you.

Sethren Argyle only presses you harder into the bookcase at your reaction,
tilting his head curiously at you. "And what do you think you'd accomplish if
you got away from me?" His tail wraps slowly around you, further keeping you
still.

Leilani growls angrily, "I'd at least get your filthy hands
off me. Give back the pendant, it belongs to me."

Sethren whispers to you, "Sorry, little one. But it's mine now. And if you say
something like that to me again..well, you'll regret it. Trust me."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You grumble angrily.

Sethren Argyle lets go of you, drawing back a bit and returning to his position
on the desk.

Sethren takes a seat on an elegant desk.

Sethren Argyle says, "I really don't think you need that pendant anyway."

Leilani slumps down a bit, a look of sheer frustration on her
face as she rubs her sore back. Your words cause her to look up in alarm,
peering suspiciously at you, "Why wouldn't I?" she asks.

Sethren Argyle says, "Because it exists simply as a reminder of your old life.
It might bring you thoughts of..escape. And those are likely bad things for
you."

Sethren Argyle says, "Perhaps when I have finally made you realize that you are
mine and that will not change, I'll give you back the pendant and collar
as..keepsakes."

You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.

You say, "I think I would prefer your... company to that of my old guild."

Sethren smirks.

You angrily say, "But that does not mean I do not wish the pendant back."

Sethren Argyle says, "So it didn't really mean that much to you?"

You say, "It belongs to me."

You say, "You do not have the right to take what is mine."

Sethren Argyle says, "And you belong to me. So it follows that..it belongs to
me as well."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say, "I do not belong to you. I simply have not found my method of escape
yet."

You grumble angrily.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'm waiting for this escape attempt of yours. Somewhat
looking forward to making you bleed a bit."

Sethren licks a needle-pointed dirk.

Leilani pales visibly, and she tries to mask it with a wry
grin. "That would require you catching me first. I told you the attempt will be
made when I am sure of its success."

Sethren Argyle stretches languidly, seeming entirely unconcerned. "Oh..I'm
sure."

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'll be ever so hard pressed to take you back.."

Sethren smirks.

You blush furiously.

Leilani slides down the wall, collapsing to the floor. She
pulls her knees up to her chest, wrapping her arms around them and resting her
head on top of her arms, an ugly scowl on her face as she glares at the books
next to her.

Sethren Argyle slips off the desk, sitting down next to you. He moves his hand
to gently stroke your hair again, watching you intently. "Now, should continue
what we were talking about before..tell me more about yourself. Why did you
join the Wytchen to begin with?".

Sethren sits down.

You stare implacably about yourself.

Leilani leans heavily back against the wall, choosing her
words carefully.

You say, "Freedom and the ideal of Coterie, which they failed to uphold.
Freedom..of spirit is important to me."

You glare angrily at Sethren.

You say, "Coterie is equally important."

Sethren Argyle says, "But there's no reason to think of something like that as
important, right?"

Sethren Argyle says, "The guild that it is now.."

Sethren shudders violently.

You say, "Family and duty are the vital balances to freedom, without duty to
something greater than yourself, freedom can turn you into nothing more than a
spoiled child, as has happened to the guild."

Sethren nods his head.

You say, "The Coterie still exists, there are those who are still wytchen in
their heart, who still uphold the values that the guild once abided by."

Sethren Argyle says, "I see..that's why it's because it's what it is now."

You frown and say, "The guild is -not- the Coterie. Nor will it ever be again,
I fear."

Sethren Argyle says, "Not enough to remind them they have something higher
they're supposed to be devoted to."

You slump down dejectedly.

You frown and say, "I tried, I tried...so hard.. through my words. Through my
writing. They didn't listen. I am not .. charismatic, or manipulative, enough
to force them to pay attention."

Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure you did try, though."

You say, "I did..."

Sethren Argyle says, "And what did you do before that?"

Leilani pulls her tome from her pouch, running her hands over
its familiar cover absentmindedly as a thoughtful look crosses herface.

Leilani snaps her head up, her momentary daydreaming broken by
your words.

You say, "Before...what?"

Sethren Argyle says, "Well..before you joined the Wytchen."

Sethren ponders the situation.

You say, "I wandered."

You shrug helplessly.

Sethren Argyle says, "Just wandered? You didn't have anyone?"

You say, "...I have never had anyone. I think I must have had parents, but I
can't remember them..."

Sethren whispers to you, "I'll be back in just a moment."

Sethren leaves to the southeast.

Leilani wraps her arms around herself, shivering lightly as
she leans back against the wall, her eyes falling closed.

Sethren arrives from the southwest.

Sethren sits down.

Leilani sighs heavily, her eyes fluttering open as she hears
you enter the room.

Sethren Argyle says, "Good..you stayed."

Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "So.."

Sethren Argyle says, "If you have never really had anymore before..why are you
so set against what I want?"

Leilani opens her mouth to respond, then sharply closes it,
frowning to herself as she ponders her words.

Sethren gazes intently at you, his forked tongue flickering inquisitively.

You angrily say, "Because you chased me down... threw me to the ground, because
you have hurt me and stolen from me. Because you seek to own me, and not to
know me for who I am. You wish to possess me and that is just not how such
things work."

Sethren Argyle says, "Perhaps I want both."

Sethren Argyle says, "I will own you, but I do think I will..get to know who
you are, in the process."

You blush furiously.

You say, "...you think you will own me."

Sethren Argyle says, "No."

Sethren Argyle says, "I know I will own you."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "It is simply a matter of time."

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren pets you ingratiatingly.

Leilani growls, her eyes flashing with anger as you pat her.
She scoots herself away from you.

Sethren Argyle takes your wrist and forcefully pulls you back against him,
smirking slightly. "Just..stay there, pet.".

Leilani blinks hard, shivering as you pull her closer to you,
unaccustomed to such close contact with another. Despite her obvious
discomfort, she remains, grumbling softly under her breath.

Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, though a little surprised at you shivering.
"Hm..interesting reaction there. Let's see.." He wraps his arms around your
waist, pulling you into his lap. "You should get used to such closeness with
me..well, you're going to have to, anyway."

Leilani blushes brightly, squirming as if she wants to climb
away from you, yet she remains. Her breath coming fast, a look of pure hatred
crosses her face. Her petite hands are clenched into tight fists, her long
nails cutting little half moons into her palms. drawing the smallest traces of
blood forth from the injured flesh.

Sethren Argyle murmurs under his breath, noticing your clenched fists. He
whispers against your ear, "You shouldn't hurt yourself..you know I'll do
plenty of that for you if you continue like this."

Leilani glances down at her clenched fists with surprise,
gasping as she realizes what she was doing. Slowly she relaxes her hands,
flexing her fingers slowly as she peers curiously at her hands.

You whisper to Sethren, "...thank you."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Sethren Argyle runs his hand rather tenderly down your back, his tail wrapping
lightly around your waist. "Is this really so bad?"

Leilani closes her eyes for a moment, drawing in a deep
breath. "This is not what it seems to be. No happy couple spending quality
time. This is prey and predator. Your false affection does not fool me."

Sethren Argyle says, "Predator..I rather like that term."

Sethren smirks.

You growl menacingly.

You say, "It suits you."

Sethren Argyle says, "And you may think it false..it really doesn't matter."

Sethren Argyle says, "So..what have you been absorbed in since you left the
Wytchen? Your books?"

You say, "I ... have wandered mostly without purpose. I devoted myself entirely
to the Coterie. Now we are spread few and far between. I do not know... what...
no, nevermind."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Sethren Argyle says, "You don't know what to do next?"

Sethren pats you in a friendly manner.

You say, "That will do."

Sethren Argyle says, "You don't have to worry, you know."

Sethren Argyle says, "About things most do.."

You raise an eyebrow questioningly.

You say, "What things would that be?"

Sethren Argyle says, "You always have something..well, someone. To be devoted
to."

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

You narrow your eyes to thin slits.

You say, "Devotion should be freely given, it cannot be stolen."

Sethren Argyle says, "Yes, it can be."

You say, "...we shall see, won't we."

Sethren Argyle says, "So."

Sethren Argyle says, "When do you think you will actually have a chance to
succeed?"

Your eyes sparkle with amusement.

You say, "Mind sitting still while I make a nice doll of you?"

Sethren smirks.

Sethren Argyle says, "And you'd still be able to do little with it."

You say, "Hmm, is that a yes, then?"

Sethren Argyle says, "No."

You wrinkle your nose disfavourably.

Sethren Argyle ponders you for a moment, his hand caressing your shoulder
lightly. He slightly unlaces the back of your corset, hand slipping underneath
to run his nails over your back, still gentle. "Hm..I wonder how you would
react if I took it off entirely."

Leilani grasps at her corset, springing from your lap in an
instant, and flees out of the library.

-run, little bird, run-
Within a spacious room. (Ssyra.)
Woven grass mats cover the wooden floors of this large, brightly lit home. The
single spacious room has been divided into sections by several simple folding
screens made from nearly transluscent papyrus. The surface of the screens has
been brightly painted with vivid depictions of totem animals, with serpents and
leopards and alligators predominating in the designs. The fire stone - a large
rock hollowed out to hold a small flame - sits in its traditional place at the
center of the room, and the clay jugs and pottery have been carefully tucked
away into niches within the walls of the house. The low hanging ceiling boasts
a number of brightly painted branches, the blue, green and red streaks of
colour intertwining for a pleasant and cheery appearance. You see a single exit
leading east (open door).

You close the door to the east.

You shiver violently.

The door to the east is opened from the other side.

Sethren moves over to block the east exit.

Sethren smirks.

Sethren Argyle says, "Cute.."

Leilani whimpers, backing up into a far corner.

Sethren closes the door to the east.

Sethren Argyle smiles coldly, moving closer to you. He reaches down and takes
hold of your hair, pulling you up with your back against him. He takes both of
your arms, pulling them behind you and securing you tightly. Leaning closer, he
whispers into your ear, "That was a terribly stupid thing to do. But..I'm glad.
There's things to try..."

Leilani growly angrily, "Leave me be!" she screams as she
tries to squirm her way out of your grip. She kicks your foot hard, trying to
escape by any means.

Sethren Argyle lets go, pushing you up against the wall of the room, his hand
around your neck. He presses down hard, cutting off your air supply. He doesn't
offer you a way out this time, though, simply staring emotionlessly at you.

Leilani gasps in surprise as she's tossed against the wall.
She struggles in vain to draw a breath as your hand wraps around her neck,
trembling with fear as her pale eyes plead with you for release. She manages to
rasp out, "Please... don't..."

Sethren Argyle whips his tail back and forth behind him, anger evident in his
eyes now. "You promised me that you wouldn't attempt to escape. But..mm..you
did. Of course you did. WHY should I let you go?" He presses down a little
harder, staring intently at you.

Leilani draws in what little air she can, gasping for breath
as her face grows very pale. She manages to whimper out, "Please... I will
behave... please...just stop."

Sethren Argyle suddenly lets go of your neck and steps back a bit, leaving you
entirely unsupported.

Leilani collapses to the floor, her hands flying to her throat
as she gulps in air, shaking violently as tears stream down her face.

Sethren Argyle watches you intently, not a trace of pity in his eyes. "Stand
up, now."

Leilani struggles to rise to her feet, fearfully cowering
before you on shaky legs. She stares hard at the ground, her arms wrapped
tightly around her midsection.

Sethren's eyes sparkle with amusement.

Sethren Argyle says, "Mhm..you should be cowering.."

Leilani sniffles quietly, drawing in a shaky breath as she
whispers in a raspy voice, "Please.. you had your fun now go away."

Sethren Argyle smiles slightly, "And, now..I want you to remove your corset.
But..keep this in mind. Do you -really- want to say "no" to me.." and at this
point he grins, a strange ferocity in his eyes, "..now?"

Leilani sobs at your words, falling to her knees. "Please...
please don't make me do that," she whimpers in a raspy voice.

Sethren Argyle shakes his head, "You don't have a choice. Now, or it will be
much worse for you."

Sethren Argyle says, "But..do stay kneeling. I don't want you trying to run off
again."

Leilani shudders, crying softly as she begins to unhook each
of the silver clasps at the front of the corset with shaky fingers. She fumbles
several times, grumbling under her breath at each turn. Finally, she lets it
drop to the floor at her feet, glaring defiantly up at you as she shivers at
the cold breeze against her exposed flesh.

Sethren Argyle nods, moving behind you and crouching down. He pulls a length of
rope from his pouch, pulling your arms behind your back and tying your wrists
tightly, and quite uncomfortably. "There..that's better. No getting away for
you now."

Leilani shifts uncomfortably, trying to adjust her wrists to
ease the pain, to no avail. She winces as the rough rope rubs against her
already sore flesh. Sighing softly, she resigns herself to the bindings, and
turns her attention to you, her eyes follow your every move as she trembles,
the fiery passion in her eyes laced with the cold edge of fear.

Sethren Argyle examines you closely, slowly slipping his dirk out of his pouch.
He runs the cold metal very lightly down your back, the point against your
skin, but not digging in at all. "Mm..this is only going to be the first part,
though. If I only use physical means as..punishment, well, it'll be hard to
break you. But you will see the other method in time."

Leilani trembles in fear, her body arching out of the way of
the sharp metal. A low whimper escapes her lips and she tries to scoot away,
not making very much progress on bended knee with her arms bound.
"...please...just leave me be," she rasps.

Sethren Argyle ignores your pleas, suddenly pressing the dirk into your back.
He slashes downwards, cutting fairly deeply into your skin. The cut causes
blood to stream down your back, and he stops for a moment, seeming almost
transfixed by it. He finishes the cut, removing the dirk and slowly licking the
blood from it.

Leilani arches her back forward away from the cruel dirk,
crying out as the blade digs into her flesh. Her entire body trembling
violently, "Please, no, Gods please stop," she whimpers. She nearly collapses
to the floor as you remove the dirk, panting heavily. She grows pale as she
feels the warm trickle of blood running down her back, and tears spill over her
lashes.

Sethren Argyle narrows his eyes slightly at your words. "Be silent. Or do I
need to gag you?"

Sethren smirks.

Leilani whimpers softly, biting down on her lower lip as she
shrinks down, fearfully listening to your every move.

Sethren Argyle nods to himself, slashing into your back in one smooth motion,
deeper this time. He grins slightly, watching the blood drip down onto the
floor. His fingers run slowly down your back and over the cuts, coming off with
blood that he promptly licks off. "Mm..as fun as I thought it would be. Glad
you tried to escape.."

Leilani cries silently to herself, her face etched with pain
as she struggles to hold back screams. Beads of sweat form on her flesh and she
begins to grow lightheaded, swaying lightly as the room begins to spin. Her
entire body trembles violently in fear, as she cowers before you.

Sethren Argyle drags his dirk slowly down your back again, cutting a gash to
accompany the other two. Your back bleeding rather profusely now, he sets the
dirk aside for now. Hands rubbing over your back, he presses his nails into the
cuts, causing even more pain.

Leilani lets out an agonized scream, unable to hold it in any
longer. She seems to find a moment of relief as she hears the dirk being set
aside, but it is soon replaced by another pain-filled screech as your nails dig
into her injure flesh. She reacts without thinking, trying desperately to pull
herself away from the source of the pain, succeeding only in tightening the
bonds around her wrists as she nearly blacks out.

Sethren Argyle presses his nails deeper, and holds them there. He whispers
against your ear, "You were only expecting to be slapped around, weren't you?
You didn't think it would actually hurt? But, well. I'm sure you want this to
stop.  Will you try to escape again?"

Leilani whimpers pitifully, unable to reign in her desperate
sobbing as she shakes her head violently, "Please...stop...I will behave. I
will do as you ask, just.. please...stop," she rasps quietly.

Sethren Argyle withdraws his nails from your back calmly, watching you as he
carefully licks his fingers clean.

Leilani pants softly, unable to stop shivering as she sobs
quietly to herself, her head hung dejectedly down. Occasionally whimpering in
pain as a slight muscle shift causes her wounds to stretch.

Sethren Argyle unties the rope around your wrists, freeing them. "Such pretty
blood..rather enjoyable, that. And I'm sure you've learned, but..I'm going to
be sure. No, not with cutting you some more..something more subtle."

Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Leilani twitches slightly at your words, panic filling her
eyes as she stares up at you, shivering uncontrollably.

Leilani rubs her wrists slightly, wincing as she catches sight
of the bruised flesh.

Sethren Argyle says, "Now..turn around and face me..sit down, make yourself as
comfortable as you can right now."

Leilani leans forward, placing her weight gingerly on all
fours as she slowly spins around. Carefully sit sits down, cross-legged. Each
movement is bought with sharp pain, and she moans softly with each new burst.
The wounds, which had begun to close themselves, send fresh rivulets of blood
down her flesh. Shuddering, she finally sits up straight, wrapping her arms
around her midsection as she stares up at you, a blank look on her face as she
awaits the next torment.

Sethren Argyle sits down carefully opposite you, cross legged as well, watching
your face carefully.

Sethren sits down.

Sethren Argyle says, "Relax, little one..I'm not going to hurt you."

Sethren Argyle says, "Not right now, anyway."

You whimper like a wounded puppy.

Leilani peers at you nervously, still shivering lightly, but
otherwise she remains very still and silent.

Sethren Argyle stares into your eyes, speaking in a quite calm, soothing tone.
"Close your eyes..relax."

Leilani gazes at you, a look of confusion crossing her face at
the sound of your voice. Her lashes begin to flutter and she seems to fight it
for a moment, but they finally fall closed, and her face smooths as she begins
to slowly relax.

Sethren Argyle continues speaking in the same tone, not making any sudden moves
and keeping entirely still. "Focus on the faintness you're feeling..block out
everything else but it and the sound of my voice. Breathe deeply..slowly."

Sethren Argyle continues in the rather monotone voice, "Block out everything
else but the sound of my voice. Nothing else concerns you..you are entirely
relaxed..comfortable. You don't feel any pain."

Argyle keeps perfectly still, not wanting to make any noises to break
the trance. "Now..you are sinking further. You will not remember what I tell
you from here on out. When I snap my fingers..you will come out of the trance.
Nod once if you understand."

Leilani nods once, slowly.

Sethren Argyle speaks more slowly, wanting to make sure his words have the full
impact they are meant to. "Now..when I say a certain phrase, you will come to
me. No matter what obstacles you need to overcome to get me..you will come.
Even if you have to cross Aetherius to reach me. Do you understand?".

Leilani nods slowly, a dreamy look crossing her face as she
slurrs, "I will come to you at all costs," in a raspy voice.

Sethren Argyle allows a hint of of being pleased to enter his voice now, the
suggestion almost implanted. "The phrase is simply.."Come to me." No other
combination of words will make it happen. And if anyone but me says the word,
it will not work. Do you understand this?".

Leilani nods slowly, whispering the words to herself, as if to
strengthen the suggestion in her own mind.

Sethren Argyle smiles, speaking again in the same calm voice. "Now, when I snap
my fingers you will remember nothing of this. However, you will still come to
me when I speak that phrase. Nod again if you understand."

You nod your acknowledgement of Sethren.

Sethren Argyle snaps his fingers in front of you, remaining absolutely still
otherwise, and watching you closely.

Leilani flutters her eyes open, staring about a bit dazed as
she slowly recovers from her groggy state. She starts as she remembers where
she is, glaring at you suspiciously, as she scratches unknowingly at her thighs
in her nervousness.

Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Sethren Argyle says, "You slept well, I hope."

You frown at Sethren.

Sethren Argyle says, "Don't you feel somewhat..refreshed?"

Leilani frowns, a look of confusing crossing her face for a
moment. She peers suspiciously at you, "...I do," she rasps.

Sethren Argyle says, "I think the corset will be a bit..painful at the moment.
But I don't want you to be cold."

Sethren gives a somber cloak lined in cerulean to you.

Sethren Argyle says, "Wear this for now."

Leilani carefully wraps herself up in the cloak, wincing as
the fabric brushes against her wounded flesh.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'm sure they won't take very long to heal."

You glare angrily at Sethren.

Sethren strokes you tenderly.

Sethren Argyle says, "Watch where you glare."

Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Leilani whimpers, shivering nervously at your touch.

Sethren Argyle says, "Hrm..I am sure you can use something to drink."

Sethren Argyle picks up his dirk from the floor, then stands up. He takes your
hand in his, pulling you upright rather gently.

Sethren Argyle says, "Follow me."

Leilani leans into you, by necessity, as her legs start to go out from under her.
She pants softly, struggling to maintain her balance.

You begin to follow Sethren.

Sethren Argyle helps you to stay upright, holding you carefully against him.
"There..little more stable now?".

Leilani nods slowly, side stepping away from you as soon as
she is able to stay upright.

Sethren Argyle takes your hand, half for a bit of a support, but also to keep
you with him.

You give a pained sigh.

Sethren Argyle says, "I'll walk a little slower."

Sethren's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Sethren opens the door to the east.
You follow Sethren to the east.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Leaving?"

You say, "I think so, not feeling to good."

Knavia looks resentfully at you and pouts with a vengeance.

"Awwwww!" Blakven says.

Knavia nods his head.

Leilani shifts her cloak, wincing slightly.

You ponder the situation.

Knavia tells you, "You're sure you don't want to talk about it?"

"Shoo! Shoo!" Knavia says to Blakven as he waves him away.

Blakven grins mischievously.

Blakven waves and says "Goodbye!"

Knavia gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

You shuffle your feet uneasily.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "You're going to tell me."

You follow Knavia to the south.

-walking-

Knavia reaches over and pulls firmly on a candelabra, causing it to tilt
slightly towards him with a creak. There is a loud screeching noise, and a
large slab of the marble floor slides away in a cloud of dust, revealing steps
leading down.

You follow Knavia to the down.

Decaying hidden archives.
A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. In one
corner lie the rotted remains of an ancient wooden chest. A skeleton is curled
up tightly here, clothes and flesh rotted away to nothing. A sigil in the shape
of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A naturally coloured hammock
has been hung here, its tassels swaying gently in the breeze.
You see a single exit leading up.

You shake your head.
You shake your head.

A candelabra next to you raises slightly, creaking as it does, and the exit
leading upwards is sealed

Knavia points accusingly at a comfortable rope hammock.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Sit."

You reach over and give a candelabra a firm pull, and it tilts forward slightly
with a creak. A loud screeching noise echoes about the room, and a large slab
of the marble above you slides away, covering you with dust and revealing steps
leading up.

A quiet alcove. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
You see exits leading north and down.

Knavia arrives from the down.
He is followed by a fearsome lion.

The candelabra raises back into place with a creak, and the slab of marble once
more slides out to seal the floor, shuddering slightly as it does.

Knavia gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

You say, "Not there..."

You shudder violently as a chill ripples down your spine.

Knavia purses his lips contemplatively.

Knavia nods his head.

Knavia sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Well."

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Here?"

You say, "Anywhere... but not there."

Knavia nods slowly.

Knavia makes a beckoning motion to no one in particular.

-walking-
Knavia points accusingly at a hammock of snowy, moonlit hues.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Now, sit and tell me all."

Knavia stares implacably at you.

You crease your brow in a frown.

Inside an abandoned house. (lost) (Bors Lake.)
An intricate mosaic tile floor of blooming reds and blues is revealed under the
swirling silt and debris that litter this place. The walls are still hung with
paintings, although the paint has long since dissolved, leaving only sad, empty
framed to add to the desolation that suffuses this place. The crumbling doorway
to the north is still standing, however the rooms beyond have collapsed,
leaving them impassable. Emanating crisp comfort, a snowy hammock of moonlit
hues hangs here. A black eel lingers here, blending with the watery shadows.
Clothed in tatters, a spectral villager floats here. A fearsome lion prowls
around here and greets you with a warning roar. Knavia Kwindan, Of the First
Circle is here.

You see a single exit leading south.

You take a seat on a hammock of snowy, moonlit hues.

Knavia Kwindan, Of the First Circle says, "Did someone hurt you?"

Leilani sighs sof
