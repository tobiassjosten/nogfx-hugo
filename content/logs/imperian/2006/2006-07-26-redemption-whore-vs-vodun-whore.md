The last vestiges of strength having ebbed from Laila's body, she sinks to the 
floor with a sigh. Suddenly, your surroundings are enveloped in a blinding 
white light, forcing you to cower with your hands over your eyes. When you 
tentatively open them once more, you are astonished to find Laila alive once 
more.

You turn to see Laila shimmer away.

Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles 
listlessly in the wind. There are 12 elegantly dressed Noctusaris here. The 
dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed brutally to the point of a rigid, 
black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, cradled in the arms of a prostrate
and faceless statue. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with the crest of the 
Empire ripples regally from the columns of the gates. A sigil in the shape of a
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. There are 5 Diavlous Knights 
here. A Diavlous Knight is manning a cannon here. He has thirty-seven cannon 
balls. An ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally decorated pedestal 
here. A roan mustang is here, its long, full mane flowing freely in the wind. 
Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. A glowing red flame-shaped sigil 
has been left here. Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst is here, delirious. A black 
ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. Kephas 
Bezaliel is here, shrouded. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in his left hand and 
a tower shield in his right. Hursh Murne, Gedar kir Idun is here. Tonbee is 
here, shrouded. He wields a living vodun doll of Tonbee in his left hand and a 
tower shield in his right. Kephas Bezaliel is here.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east 
(gate open).
