Azlyn arrives from the south.

Azlyn lashes out with his whip and drags Volta into the room.

Volta's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Have a seat."

Volta sits down.

Azlyn looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Cobra..."

Volta nods his head.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Correct?"

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Where?"

Volta ponders for a moment and says "Hrm..."Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Neck? forearm? chest?"

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "You tell me."

Volta Devilen says, "Chest."

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Or you let it decide."

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Up to you."

Azlyn nods his head.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow gets down on his knees in front of the silver
pot and lays out a large collection of inks.

Volta Devilen says, "Hard to tattoo through that I suppose."

Azlyn shrugs helplessly.

Azlyn ponders a silver pot's profile, wondering if it would make a suitable
subject for a portrait.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow begins pouring inks into the silver pot, one
after the other, and all the colours begin running together.

Azlyn tugs impatiently on your arm.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "You here?"

You shake your head.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Gimme your hand."
Azlyn pokes at you.

Krysaliss tilts her head curiously, offering her hand to Azlyn.

Azlyn's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow grabs Krysaliss by the wrist and quickly
drags his dirk across her palm.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Alright....squeeze tight."

Krysaliss winces, glaring up at Azlyn, "Warning next time,"
she says, squeezing her small fist tight as directed.

Volta's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Let the blood drip into the pot."
Azlyn taps his nose knowingly.

Krysaliss holds her hand over the pot, allowing the blood
quickly pooling in her hand to flow into it.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow grabs hold of his dirk and drags it across
his own palm. Squeezing his fist tightly over the pot and letting the dark
blood drain into the pot as well.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Alright..."

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says to Volta, "Lay down."

Volta Devilen lies down.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Good..."

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Now..."

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Last person I did this with."

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Told me it was a bit painful."

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "So...suck it up."

Azlyn pats Volta in a friendly manner.

Volta curls his nose up and grimaces awfully.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow waves his hand quickly over the pot and
utters a short charm in a language you don't quite understand.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow holds the pot above your torso and begins to
pour. As the ink lands on your skin it begins to hiss and churn and your nose
detects a hint of burnt flesh.

"Heh heh heh," Azlyn chuckles.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Favorite part."

Azlyn hums quietly to himself.

Volta shakes his head.

Azlyn grins mischievously.

The ink continues to churn and begins slowly forming into the outline of what
appears to be a snake.

The inks take on the outline of a cobra and let out a hiss as they seem to
attempt to leap from your chest!

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Gah."

Volta nods his head.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow utters another quick charm and waves his hand
over the tattoo on your chest. The tattoo lets out a final hiss before adhering
completely to your skin.

Azlyn pats Volta in a friendly manner.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Eh...you lived."

Volta Devilen says, "Barely.."

Volta's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.

Azlyn doffs his hat cordially.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow pours the remnants of the ink out on the
ground. The ink bubbles and forms itself into another cobra.

Azlyn mumbles incoherently.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow shoos away the cobra, waving his arms at it
and yelling obscenities at it in hanyou.

Azlyn mutters discontentedly.

Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "The extra ink chose to make itself
into another livin' tattoo."
