Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. This has been marked as holy ground. 
A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. Heated breath flaring his 
nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A small oil lamp made of 
tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A lithe desert fox 
slinks cunningly nearby. A fearsome lion prowls around here and greets you with
a warning roar. A marble altar stands tall here, in supreme devotion to Vahin, 
the Protector, and behind it rests a large carved towershield depicting a mace 
and sword, crossed before a set of scales and surrounded by a strange runic 
script. A bald eagle soars about on the thermal currents. Emanating crisp 
comfort, a snowy hammock of moonlit hues hangs here. A cleric of Antioch is 
here carefully scrutinizing passersby. A proud Justicar of the Shah stands here
at attention. A muamrite archer is mounted on a camel, his eyes watching the 
skies with bow at the ready. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large 
cream colored Graytrem draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. A satin 
black wolf stalks silently here. He sniffs the air for prey. An intricately 
carved muamrite guard's spear lies abandoned here. A linseed lies here. The 
shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Angelic Pulse, 
Alithea Vuh'uni is here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a 
spiritual mace in her right. Stablehand Brydun Sylvaleaf, Student of Justice is
here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each hand. You see a sign here 
instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, and northwest.

backwards at the impact.
