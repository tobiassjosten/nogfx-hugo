Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "Yeah... bless my norrjin blood, I guess."
<274/274h 216/225m 1198e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Bless it well, because you really 
are a breathtaking woman."

<274/274h 216/225m 1195e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Bowing now?"
<274/274h 216/225m 1195e 979w <eb>> 
Doshar smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
<274/274h 216/225m 1194e 979w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "I don't do curtsies. Those are for 
Ladies."
<274/274h 216/225m 1193e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "And you're no lady."
<274/274h 216/225m 1193e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "You're a woman."
<274/274h 216/225m 1193e 979w <eb>> 
Doshar utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
<274/274h 216/225m 1192e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora nods her head.
<274/274h 216/225m 1192e 979w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "I... used to say I was an an'sheri, but 
now that word has gained new connotations."
<274/274h 216/225m 1190e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Mm, yeah."
<274/274h 216/225m 1190e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Don't attack me, buuut."
<274/274h 216/225m 1183e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune readies her groinkicking foot.
<274/274h 216/225m 1182e 979w <eb>> 
Doshar whispers something to Asmora.
<274/274h 216/225m 1180e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar creases his brow in a frown.
<274/274h 216/225m 1181e 978w <eb>> 
Your pipe has gone cold and dark.
(+2 more...)
<274/274h 216/225m 1181e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar quickly ducks down.
<274/274h 216/225m 1181e 979w <eb>> 
Asmora narrows her eyes to thin slits.
<274/274h 216/225m 1180e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector frowns and says, "Oh boys, brace 
yourselves."
<274/274h 216/225m 1180e 979w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "Lucky I'm graced. And need to stay that 
way."
<274/274h 216/225m 1178e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar wipes the back of his hand across his brow in relief.
<274/274h 216/225m 1178e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Safe for tonight boys."
<274/274h 216/225m 1177e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector frowns and says, "But an Amazon never 
forgets."
<274/274h 216/225m 1177e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "Due to death threats from FOUR out of six 
cities."
<274/274h 216/225m 1177e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora flexes her muscles in an impressive display of strength.
<274/274h 216/225m 1177e 979w <eb>> 
It is the 2nd day of Fas, in the year 557 AD.
<274/274h 216/225m 1177e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "I'd laugh, but that's not really 
funny."
<274/274h 216/225m 1176e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "But like I said. Norrjin blood. I think 
I'm at least a quarter norrjin, and they're well-known for being, ah, 
well-endowed."
<274/274h 216/225m 1174e 978w <eb>> 
Comprehension flashes across Doshar's face.
<274/274h 216/225m 1174e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "I get it."
<274/274h 216/225m 1174e 979w <eb>> 

<274/274h 216/225m 1174e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Kinda lucked out on the genes."
<274/274h 216/225m 1172e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar grins mischievously.
<274/274h 216/225m 1172e 978w <eb>> 
"Mhmm," Asmora murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

You sent the following message to Iniko: Yeah, handofsutekh is my aim.
<274/274h 216/225m 1172e 979w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "My sister's the same way."
<274/274h 216/225m 1172e 979w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Your sister?"
<274/274h 216/225m 1172e 979w <eb>> 
"Mhmm," Asmora murmurs, nodding slow and deliberately.

<274/274h 216/225m 1170e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Who?"
<274/274h 216/225m 1170e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "Pheysi."
<274/274h 216/225m 1170e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "She... used to be a bard."
<274/274h 216/225m 1170e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar nods his head.
<274/274h 216/225m 1169e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora gives a pained sigh.
<274/274h 216/225m 1169e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "Now... I dunno. Haven't talked to her in 
years."
<274/274h 216/225m 1168e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Is -she- straight at least?"
<274/274h 216/225m 1167e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar utters a deep, rumbling laugh.
<274/274h 216/225m 1167e 979w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "Yeah, mostly. But I believe she's 
Stavennite now."
<274/274h 216/225m 1165e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar sticks his tongue out and says 'Ack.'
<274/274h 216/225m 1164e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "So... yeah."
<274/274h 216/225m 1163e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora shrugs helplessly.
<274/274h 216/225m 1163e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "Looking at her pretty sister is fun 
'nough though."
<274/274h 216/225m 1159e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar chuckles long and heartily.
<274/274h 216/225m 1159e 977w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "Heh."
<274/274h 216/225m 1158e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector says, "And since she's grace, she can't 
murder me!"
<274/274h 216/225m 1158e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector looks skeptical and says, "She can scorn me
though."
<274/274h 216/225m 1158e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora sneers and looks scornfully at Doshar.
<274/274h 216/225m 1158e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar creases his brow in a frown.
<274/274h 216/225m 1157e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar snuffles softly.
<274/274h 216/225m 1157e 978w <eb>> 
Doshar turns his back on Asmora and pointedly ignores her.
<274/274h 216/225m 1157e 979w <eb>> 
Asmora flashes the victory sign.
<274/274h 216/225m 1157e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector frowns and says, "The pretty ones are 
always the mean ones."
<274/274h 216/225m 1155e 978w <eb>> 
Asmora, Blessed by Misfortune says, "I'm not ACTUALLY mean."
<274/274h 216/225m 1153e 978w <eb>> 
Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector exclaims, "You are!"

Within a commemorative hall.
Within the center of the hall is a stehl statue, crafted to perfection with a 
lifelike quality. Braziers have been placed on either side of the statue, 
casting light onto the subject's mischievous smile. A single rose the color of 
twilight has been gently laid before the alter here. In front of the statue is 
a small altar, the offerings upon it ranging between gold and flowers. A 
builder's belt lays here, each tool in its proper place. A delicate golden 
hammer leans against the base of the statue.
You see exits leading southeast, southwest, and out.

Your aggressive action causes your mask to fall away.
You slowly make your away around behind Doshar, far enough away to remain 
inconspicuous.
<274/274h 198/225m 1085e 1016w <e->> 
You have recovered balance.
*************BALANCE************
<274/274h 198/225m 1085e 1016w <eb>> 
As you approach Doshar's back, you quietly draw your knife to the ready, 
holding it low and out of sight.
<274/274h 198/225m 1086e 1016w <eb>> 
With one last, silent step, you find yourself directly behind Doshar and 
prepare yourself for the pounce.
<274/274h 198/225m 1086e 1018w <eb>> 
A flick of the wrist, a flash of your blade, and you take Doshar hostage with 
your knife to his throat.

You swiftly drag the edge of your knife across Doshar's throat, splitting flesh
and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to flow from the horrible 
wound in his neck as he topples to the ground, turning around to give you a 
look of despair as the light slowly fades from his eyes.
You have slain Doshar.
You reach over to comfort Doshar as he falls to the overall level of Almighty.

Beneath the waterfall. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The Pool of 
Inspiration rests here placidly at the base of a grand waterfall, shimmering 
with the silent promises of a new beginning. Beautifully crafted in polished 
white marble, a figure stands enshrouded in robes intricately detailed to 
appear nearly life-like. Swirling tendrils of soft light wrap themselves around
the statue, bathing it in a bluish tinge. There are 2 large advertising signs 
here. A large, gold flecked hawk hovers in the air gracefully here, its wings 
shimmering in the light.
You see exits leading in, and a crumbling pathway leads up.
