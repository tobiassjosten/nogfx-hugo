Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stone, a grey 
mist surrounds its ethereal light, which is known to be a source of inspiration
and life. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a 
Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera,
a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble
rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop 
an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings.
An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a 
Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here,
marble foam about its mouth. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over 
the Springs. There are 4 corpses of a red-backed vole here. Skeli Xianfu is 
here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, and a crumbling pathway leads 
down.
