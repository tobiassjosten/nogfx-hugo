The captain's quarters. (Scourge Outpost.)
A simple wooden desk stands at the end of the room opposite the bed. A large 
rope bed stands at one end of the oval room. Grorsh, the orc captain stands 
scowling in the middle of the room.

Xanthus points the staff of the Quinta Essentia at Grorsh, the orc captain, and

pitifully.
Grorsh, the orc captain has been slain by Xanthus.
A large pile of sovereigns spills from the corpse.
