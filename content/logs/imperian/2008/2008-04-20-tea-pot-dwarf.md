Dranor, God of Imagination says, "Next: Juganothion."

(Burt): Sarrius says, "Jugs go."

(Burt): Ashel says, "Oh shit."

(Burt): Sarrius says, "JUGS BETTER BE GOOD."

(Burt): Lalitana says, "Haha."

(Burt): Anthe says, "This is about to become the second area that I've 
completely deleted and redone."

(Burt): Ashel says, "So Jugs goes afk instead."

(Burt): Kalara says, "Lulz."

(Burt): Ashel says, "Amazing Drongon imitation though."

(Burt): Kalara says, "Let's see..."

Dranor lightly taps Juganothion.

Warlord Juganothion Gazali says, "Sorry."

Juganothion coughs softly.

A red wind begins to whip around Juganothion, overwhelming his entire form. 
When the winds subside, you see that he has been turned into a Dwarf.

(Burt): Kalara says, "Two...three...four...five..."

Juganothion takes a drink from a wooden vial.
 
(Burt): Kalara says, "Five so far afking..."

Warlord Juganothion Gazali walks out slowly, a wispy green dress overlapping 
his normally well defined form, as he takes center stage. Standing tall and 
proud he slowly lets his eyes run across the the crowd before clearing his 
throat. He spreads his arms wide before taking a more poetic pose as his voice 
fills the room.

Menoch gives Juganothion the once over.
 
(Burt): Ashel says, "OH GOD."
 
(Burt): Lalitana says, "Oh jeusus."

Warlord Juganothion Gazali sings, "I'm a little teapot, short and stout."

(Burt): Sarrius says, "OH GOD."

(Burt): Sarrius says, "YES."

(Burt): Kalara says, "Oh son of a bitch."

(Burt): Ashel says, "Hahahahahaha."

(Burt): Deornia says, "Win."

(Burt): Kalara says, "Lolololololol."

(Burt): Lalitana says, "AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAH."

(Hoa): Leilani says, "OMG."

Warlord Juganothion Gazali leans over provocatively, twirling quickly as he 
skips about around the circle gathered before him. Allowing each viewer a 
glimpse at the treasure beneath  his top, he sings in a sweet, falsceto voice.

(Ring): Salish says, "Heheheheh."

Warlord Juganothion Gazali sings, "Here is my handle, here is my spout."

(Burt): Lalitana says, "OH GOOD GOD ALSO YOU MISSPELLED FALSETTO."

(Hoa): Leilani says, "Oh my god."

Warlord Juganothion Gazali sings, "When I get all steamed up, hear me shout!"

(Burt): Sarrius says, "ROFL."

Warlord Juganothion Gazali stomps his feet on the ground, as if pouting about a
Kinsarmarian guard he was not able to kill, due a Chalice of Life suddenly 
appearing to thwart his deeds.

(Burt): Ashel says, "LOL."

(Burt): Deornia says, "Yeah but that kinda makes it funnier."

(Burt): Ashel says, "HARSH."

(Burt): Vlice says, "Um ..."

(Burt): Sarrius says, "ROFL."

Warlord Juganothion Gazali sings, "Tip me over and pour me out!"

(Burt): Sarrius says, "HARSH."
 
(Ring): Salish says, "He wins.."

Warlord Juganothion Gazali bends over slowly, his left hand dipping to form the
form spout of a teapot as he ruffles the lower regions of his dress with his 
right hand, showing just enough of the skin beneath the hem to draw a grasp 
from the audience, letting it fall to his knees again.

(Burt): Ashel says, "Oh jesus."

(Ring): Salish says, "I hope he wins!"

Warlord Juganothion Gazali curtsies cutely, before skipping away, still humming
the tune.

(Burt): Ashel says, "Hahahahahahahahaha."

(Burt): Lalitana says, "Godalmighty."

(Burt): Sarrius says, "Hahahahahahahahaha."

(Burt): Kalara says, "Just enough to draw a GRASP from the audience."

Dranor, God of Imagination says, "Sick. Just sick."

(Burt): You say, "Awesome."

(Burt): Kalara says, "He wants to get groped :]."

(Burt): Sarrius says, "Hahahaha."

(Ring): You say, "That was awesome."

(Burt): Kalara says, "Omfg, that was epic."

(Ring): Salish says, "I love him now.."
