Issue #16596   Reported by: Valena    Re: Draven
2008-06-25 10:02:03: 
(Accidentally deleted this issue as opposed to another, so this is a second 
filing) Draven tells you, \"Live by the whore, die by the whore.\" You tell 
Incinerate Draven Acerbus, Messenger of \'Ab, \"Come out here and die.\" Draven 
tells you, \"Nah. I\'m nowhere near a next Circle.\" You tell Incinerate Draven 
Acerbus, Messenger of \'Ab, \"Come out here or the Divine will hear of your 
unnecessary profanity.\" An IC resolution was attempted, he was warned thathis language was unappreciated and he still refused to resolve this. The only exchange Draven has ever had with Valena prior to this was where he randomly jumped Valena while hunting in the sewers, she killed him, he proceeded to insult her, non-vulgarly. The only word ever exchanged from Valena was \'Coward\'. Not only was his comment uncalled for, it had no IC purpose to it. There was no precedent for this derogatory insult. Draven is simply furthering his own hatred and profanity toward me based on feelings from an outside source (The Forums) and attempting to circumvent forum laws by using in-game vulgar insults. [Edit: Knowing his response due to accidental deletion: In previous instances where Tallasar has lost issues for using the insult of \'skank,\'  \'whore\' is hardly something that isn\'t viewed not only as vulgar but as a  sexually harassing term.]

Stavenn and Antioch have been embroiled in a pretty lethal war, of which  Valena\'s been a part of. She\'s been involved in plenty of fights, so attempting the defense she hasn\'t been involved is a pretty big stretch of the truth. Also, a previous issue by Zenigra against me for use of the word \"whore\" was dropped, so I\'m fairly certain its not a word that is issuable for language purpose. Also, I directed the word \"whore\" at the skills, not at the character or player, which she\'s fully aware of. Lastly, - Valena tells you, \"Come out here or the Divine will hear of your unnecessary profanity.\" - She\'s using issues as blackmail to force PK. She\'s not offended by the language, which I was aware of. She was simply latching onto something to force me to come out and fight her, and when I refused, she followed through on the blackmail. In the end, she\'s using an OOC channel to try to get me punished for an IC action, which I\'m fairly certain is exactly what she\'s accusing me of. Ironic, eh? If, however, the Divine have changed their opinion regarding the word \"whore,\" I\'d be more than happy to comply and restrict my usage of the word. I\'ve been in trouble for language usage in the past, and I\'ve been on my best behavior  regarding it.

Draven tells you, \"I truly hope you let that issue go to judgment, so I can  [b]Draven tells you, \"I truly hope you let that issue go to judgment, so I can  post the result on Nogfx. Thx.\" [/b]No previous discussion of OOC except an  inference towards the issue system. Draven has on numerous occasions just  assumed that I tolerate OOC communication from any random person on an IC  level, despite the fact that the tells I communicate with through Valena always differentiate between IC and OOC. This is just a snide comment meant in a degrading manner conveyed in an OOC method. You\'d think after the unnecessary  profanity, and then his refusal of an IC resolution of previous conflicts he\'d let issue drop but instead continues to try and bait Valena through OOC based communications

OOC conversation is hardly against the rules, and she\'s made no effort to ask  me to cease. This isn\'t an issuable offense unless she specifically requests me to stop. Also, the snub feature is available to her. However, now that she\'s  demonstrated her dislike of OOC conversation with me (despite the fact she  speaks OOCly with dozens of other people), I will take the initiative and snub her myself, to prevent this from being an issue in the future.
