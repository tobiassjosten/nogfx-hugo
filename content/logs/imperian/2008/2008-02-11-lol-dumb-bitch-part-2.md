You feel sickened and weak by the aura of death emanating from Kalea. (something) (focus)

Issue #14588   Reported by: Kiandra    Re: Kalea 
2008-02-11 18:08:00:  
Attacking me with absolutely no provocation. I'm running a caravan from  
Pabin'aquinumi and back and Kalea arrives, attacking me. I have done absolutely 
nothing to provoke her and I couldn't even if I tried - she is snubbing me.  
After she drives me away and destroys my caravan, she starts laughing at me.  
She's just harassing and griefing me and I've done nothing to warrant it. 

(apparently Kalea is even more ninja than me and can laugh at people through snub without unsnubbing them)


(Kiandra) On Imp forums:
I hate Kalea and Fazlee attacking me while I'm running caravans and destroying the caravan each time, especially when I've never done anything to them and I couldn't if I tried (they're both snubbing me).
