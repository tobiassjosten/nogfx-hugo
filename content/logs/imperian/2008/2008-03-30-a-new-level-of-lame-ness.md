You pull an arrow from your quiver and nock it to your bow.
Fastening the tethered arrow to your wrist, you fire to the ether.

You sense that Meruchakri has entered North of Nolmine Heights, relatively 
unscathed. (427)
From your knowledge, that room is in 'Western Nolmine Heights.'

you don't know if you are going the same way as before or not, everything looks

into your mind. You pause in your journey, here amid the grasses, to give a 
silent thanks for those who passed before you and eased your way. That silent 
moment leaves you uplifted for many miles. A fairly large group of prickly

North of Nolmine Heights. (road). (lost) (Western Nolmine Heights.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Northwest and east the
highway rolls, a thin link to connect a continent. While you usually take for 
granted the luxury of being able to have this track to ease your journey, for 
some reason the thought of the years of labor and the dedication of the workers
that were needed to erect it settles into your mind. You pause in your journey,
here amid the grasses, to give a silent thanks for those who passed before you 
and eased your way. That silent moment leaves you uplifted for many miles. A 
fairly large group of prickly pears lies discarded here. There are 4 pieces of 
kelp in 4 groups here. There are 6 maidenhair leaves in 6 groups here. Some 
hyssop stem is discarded here. A ripe quince fruit lies here. Hovering in the 
air and singing a sweet melody is a brilliantly coloured bluebird. Huge eyes 
gleaming luminously an eagle owl perches nearby. Chittering madly, a 
ring-tailed raccoon darts furtively about underfoot. Massive and immovable as 
an iceberg, a tundra bear stands proudly here. Eyes glinting with bloodlust, an
arctic wolf prowls here. Sniffing at the wind curiously, a small white fox 
pauses here. A bald eagle soars about on the thermal currents. Preening her 
wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. Silent and observant, a red 
fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. Poised 
nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. Wings outstretched
to catch the breeze, a red-tailed hawk observes you silently. Hackles raised, 
an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Nervously pacing, a small brown 
lemming scampers under your feet. Arvanian Kwindan is here, hidden. Sentinel 
Gurn Tellaris, Woodland's Vindication is here, hidden. Delver of the Depths, 
Meruchakri Da'Saison, Alente's Trident is here, hidden.
