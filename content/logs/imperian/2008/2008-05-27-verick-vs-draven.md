Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The once grand market 
square of ancient Caanae surrounds this centralized point, where the ground has
been shaken and torn apart by a catastrophic event. Three meticulously carved 
pillars embossed with runic scripts lie collapsed upon the ground. The remnants
of a gold-trimmed roof lean askew to one side of the stone pile, blocking the 
view from outside of all the wonders housed within this temple. Barely standing
under the weight of a pillar is a marble altar, which has been etched with 
scars and scratches from the passage of time and elements. The structure of the
pillars silently displays how it was once a small but impressive temple; the 
inscriptions upon the altar indicate it to have been built in honor of Avasyu. 
Flowing freely from the cracks in the centre is a passage of pure water, 
perhaps the purest known in the realm of Aetherius. A rune circle has been 
sketched into the ground here. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth 
from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and 
brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration 
and life. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a 
Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera,
a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey 
granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble
rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop 
an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings.
An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a 
Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here,
marble foam about its mouth. A comfortable leather sofa sits here. A shimmering
orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A small 
sign points into a market stall. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast 
over the Springs. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, flexing its long wiry 
antennae. Incinerate Draven Acerbus, Messenger of 'Ab is here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
