Victory Circle. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. Squatting next to a large straw basket, 
Bina, the blind, peels husks from young fava beans. His head held high as if 
deigning to be in the presence of others, Lorves Annat, the Engineer, cleans a 
small, handheld weapon with the utmost of care. A huge ball of fire hovers high
above a massive sandstone pillar. An Antioch cleric is manning a cannon here. 
She has seventy-one cannon balls. A heavy wooden chest sits here, with the 
words 'Donation' carved on it. A long-haired ibex stands here, scraping at the 
stones of the street.
You see exits leading north, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest, and in
.
Zerin eases herself out of the Scorpion stance.
Bina, the blind says, "Beware crossing the rubble to the Demon's Gate. The 
flames are deadly for the demons and mortals alike."
A tame-looking ibex reaches his long neck out to nibble at Zerin.
