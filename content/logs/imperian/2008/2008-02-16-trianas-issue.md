You say to Balid, "Make a move and I kill both novices."

Balid's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
Balid thrusts the haft of a blade-tipped glaive at you.
You are hurled upwards by the force of the blow as the breath is knocked out of
you.

With a lightning-quick motion, you slash Triana with a strong broadsword.
The final blow proves too much for Triana, who falls to the floor a broken, 
bloody mess.
You have slain Triana.

Allow me to dissect this issue. Triana was slain after Balid attacked Kiandra. 
Kiandra was, more or less, holding Triana and her partner hostage - Balid 
decided to do the (to her) unwise thing, and attack. Kiandra promptly responded
by executing one of the hostages. I see this as a decent attempt at roleplay, 
and it failed, because Balid chose action over roleplaying. Second off, this 
issue is not very well-written. It is a single sentence, and not even a 
sentence - it contains a complete lack of capitals or punctuation. It is 
actually a sentence fragment. This is nowhere near enough detail to even 
register as a thought-out issue. This brings me to the conclusion that this is 
a spurious issue, filed simply because the player was complaining about her 
death. This is not Achaea. One does not gain or lose PK cause here. Killing is 
permitted in reasonable amounts. I have not slain Triana repetitively or 
without any previous contact. It was the roleplaying decision that Kiandra made
to take her hostage and threaten to kill her if Balid did not leave, which he 
did not do. I'd also like to mention the fact that Triana is most likely an alt
of a more veteran player. She has expressed certain behaviors that have led me 
to believe that she could not be a weak defenseless novice like she makes out 
to be. She knew full well what was going on, knew how to stop it, and she did 
not stop it as she did not recognize the concept of roleplaying in that event. 
One more thing: no IC resolution was attempted. The issue was filed without any
IC or OOC contact by Triana.
