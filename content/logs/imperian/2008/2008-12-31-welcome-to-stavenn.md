Samiel ponders the situation.

You have emoted: Alaia takes a casual step forward, running a long forefinger along the blade of her dagger as she eyes Anarion, her lips curling into a grim smile. Wrapping her fingers around one of his wrists she yanks his hand towards herself, placing the sharpened tip of the blade to the cuticle of his middle finger, driving the blade deep underneath the nail before angling the dagger  upwards, causing the nail to come free from the flesh of his finger. As the nail falls to the floor, she bends over to pick it up, turning to hand the bloodied nail to Suza.

Samiel swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev becomes almost entirely limp, appearing to be unconscious.

Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General begins to lean more heavily on the sabre now as the blade inches it's way into the stomach of Anarion. After a moment, the blade ceases to move and a barely audible click can be heard as the tip makes contact with the ground.

Linslet slaps Anarion on the cheek.

Lord Samiel De'Linguilette, Quartermaster General asks, "Anyone have some whiskey or something of the sort?"

Samiel swings his scaled tail back and forth contently.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says, in Hanyou, "I think few of you realize how powerful a bit of speech can be. With the state he's in, that will matter little now. Pain can consume one's mind and leave little else to be done."

The Harlequin, Linslet Iscariot sighs sadly, raising from her position.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "You're a bloody mess, eh?"

Blackguard Anarion Reopev sputters and coughs, shaking in pain, unable to form words.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "And you've lost everything too. Where's that old pride of yours, mm?"

Blackguard Anarion Reopev tries to focus his vision on Ren. He gives up after a moment, resting his head on the cold floor, still sputtering.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Take your time. I'd like to hear you whine at me."

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit flicks out a brightly coloured tarot card and flings it at Anarion, his wounds slowly beginning to fade about his mouth and throat.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev coughs as the wounds heal, breathing in loudly.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "This is what you.."

Anarion coughs softly.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says, in Hanyou, "It was your own choice that brought you to this. You have only yourself to blame. A sorry little man, in the end."

Suza brushes her hair aside.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "End this already, Ren. If any part of you is still a man, give me the death I deserve."

Caitryn tilts her head curiously at Anarion.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Where's all that hatred and bile you had for me before?"

Blackguard Anarion Reopev laughs softly to himself, staring at the wall in front of him.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Anarion, in Hanyou, "Look at me."

Blackguard Anarion Reopev turns his gaze to Ren, still laughing. "You know Sagron's going to give me axes. Then I'm going to cut out your pretty throat.".

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit gives a slow grin.

Blackguard Anarion Reopev says, "Then I'm going to cut out Kira's."

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says to Sagron, in Hanyou, "I've finished with him. Take care of him, Lord Imperator."

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit stands slowly.

Augur Ren Fel'Amrit says, in Hanyou, "Kira's, mm? I'd like to be there for that."

Imperator Sagron Savet laughingly says, "Welcome to Stavenn."

Sagron wreathes his hand in crackling black energy. With a diabolical laugh, he stiffens his hand and slowly runs it down Anarion's splayed-out body, splitting his chest in two as he does so. Though Anarion screams in pain and begs to die, Sagron proceeds to rip apart his organs. Finally, with a detached smile upon  his face, he proceeds to rip the sternum out of Anarion's body and drive it  through his body, pinning it to the ground and killing him instantly. 
Anarion has been slain by Sagron.
Anarion drops a linseed.

You grin mischievously at Sagron.
