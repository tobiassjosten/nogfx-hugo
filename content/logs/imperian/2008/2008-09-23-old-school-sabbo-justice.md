Keilani Lynne, Heiress of the Shadows says to you, "Learn your facts well
Krysaliss. For I said nothing about nor against the Saboteurs or their
leadership, I was merely in the room. Being a tyrant will earn you nothing.
I've never been afraid to stand up for what is right, and you are wrong. Any
leader would get the entire story from all involved parties before threatening
and pointing fingers. I'm glad to not see you ruin my father's hard work any
further. And for the rest of you here, I'd think really hard about the
tyranical 'god' that is running this guild. I was just outguilded for nothing,
pure contempt for a wayward daughter who no longer claims this selfish woman as
her mother. Farewell everyone. Those of you who I've met, seem to have respect,
far more so than Krysaliss Lynne."

But you cannot deny that the leadership is open and honest whenever possible."

Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Pish. Every guild has similar

expect we already knew what was coming."

You give the decapitated head of Xaric to Sethren Argyle.

You give the decapitated head of Keilani to Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi,
Shifting Shadow.

You say, "Cut them out for me, you have much more skill with a blade than I
do."

Azlyn nods sagely.

You grin mischievously at Azlyn.

Iluv nods his head in agreement.

Hiroshi Devilen says, "How do we get out of here."

a moron?"

that you forgive me for not seeking my evidence out a little more. He just
seemed to be along what I want for the guild, and I never thought of where he
got his sources and his purpose."

the bloody privy in here. It's getting repugnant."

Iluv says, "That eased a lot of tension."

Ferratilis Dolson Reopev, Phantom Reverant says, "Well, i need to ease some,
but I'll be damned if I sit on that odiforous waste pile."

Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow places the head of Keilani on
the ground. He places his foot on the lower jaw and pulls out the tongue with
his right hand, and quickly cuts the tongue out of the decapitated head. With a
slight grin, he hands the tongue over to Krysaliss.

Sethren begins to wield a needle-pointed dirk in his left hand.

You have emoted: Krysaliss grins happily at Azlyn and quickly pulls a small
glass jar from her pack, the tongue dropping into it with a dull thud.

Sarrius tells you, "Ew."

Sarrius tells you, "Aren't you atleast going to put some preservative fluid in
it?"

Iluv smiles and says, "Xaric and Keilani won't be tongue-kissing anytime soon."

Sarrius snickers softly to himself.

Sethren Argyle yawns at Azlyn, deftly breaking open the jaw of Xaric's head.
Doing so lets the tongue hang out freely, allowing him to cut the tongue off
with a single swipe of his dirk. He tosses it to Krysaliss.

You tell Sarrius Chytovil, "Of course, I don't exactly carry that around with
me, ya know."

Sethren Argyle says, "Much more efficient."

Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "Nor will they be
sleeping with eachother in the guildhall..."

Sethren nods his head.

Sarrius tells you, "Obviously."

Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says, "I'd have somebody hose
down the parlour before anybody puts it to use again."

Alaron Mikain says, "They won't be among the living to kiss each other,
either."

Sarrius tells you, "Not like you'd need to. It's not a common place item you
need every day, heh."

Azlyn rolls his eyes at Sethren.

Alaron licks a needle-pointed dirk.

Mykael leans against the wall.

Opportunistic Azlyn Kaziganthi, Shifting Shadow says to Sethren, "I'm four feet
tall...I don't have the upper body strength for that."

You have emoted: Krysaliss catches the tongue deftly, and tosses it into the
jar with Keilani's severed tongue.

"Heh heh heh," Sethren chuckles.

Sethren Argyle says, "Anything else, or can we all go? There are tongues that
need preserving."
