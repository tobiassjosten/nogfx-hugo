Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A rune
like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the 
pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal 
light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved statue of light grey 
granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin 
here. A plain metal bed rests upon the ground here. A detailed statue of light 
grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of 
feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, 
perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled 
with offerings. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here 
depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. Tomast the Cleric stands here, 
his gaze cast over the Springs. There are 2 corpses of a small grey mouse here.
A small sign points into a market stall. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a 
massive warhorse stands here imperially. Tiny nose twitching, a sleek ermine 
scampers about here. Huge eyes blinking sleepily at you, a snowy owl roosts 
here. Fluttering about and calling raucously, an arctic tern hovers in the air 
here. Massive and immovable as an iceberg, a tundra bear stands proudly here. 
Eyes glinting with bloodlust, an arctic wolf prowls here. Sniffing at the wind 
curiously, a small white fox pauses here. Calmly gazing upon her surroundings 
with ice blue eyes, a healthy white mare stands here upon strong legs. A noble 
falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding you watchfully. Sir Drongon 
Vuh'uni, Grand Templar is here. He wields a dancer's sabre in his left hand and
a curved sabre in his right. Helana is here, pondering.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

1.9 CUSTOMER SERVICE

The method by which one obtains customer service in Imperian is via the ISSUE
command. By using this command, you report that you have an "issue" that needs
attending to. This should not be used for bugs or ideas (those should be filed
using the BUG or IDEA command).

The syntax to use the issue command is:

   ISSUE <person> <a description of your issue>.
     -or-
   ISSUE ME <a description of your issue>.

Note that an issue is always regarding someone, be it someone who is causing
your problem or a problem regarding only you. Once your issue is filed, a
message is sent to the other involved party (if there is one) requesting a
response from him or her. The administration will then see about solving your
problem as promptly as possible.

If you have an issue filed regarding you (by someone else), you will want to

Note that when replying to an issue, you are talking to the administrators, not
to the person who filed the issue originally.

Please do not file spurious issues, such as "I was killed by Bob." You must
include details in your issue. Someone (generally an Administrator) will deal
with your issue as soon as He or She has time.

You burp obscenely.

You are surrounded by a shining corona of blinding light as your soul is 
transformed by the bonding.
You raise your arms aloft and roar aloud a challenge to the heavens as you take (wyvern bond)
on the form of ultimate power - the spirit of the Wyvern.

You take a deep breath and feel the heat begin to build within you.

Helana is confounded as an arctic tern flutters rapidly around her.
With claws and fangs sharper than shards of ice, a tundra bear strikes and 
shreds Helana's flesh.

Issue #14489   Reported by: Helana    Re: Iluv
2008-01-28 03:54:56: 
Iluv is using Vary Harsh language that i dont really want to hear while i play.
i respectfully ask that this is taken up. As i find it rather un acceptable.

I apologize for using harsh language, but this issue came out of nowhere. 
Helana did not make any attempt to let me know that my use of harsh language, 
to portray an equally harsh character, was ruining her game experience and 
instead she issued me right away before trying to resolve this problem 
in-character.

Also, I didn't kill her because she issued me. I was already going to kill her but she issued me before I got my final word so I checked the issue to see if it was harrassment and it wasn't so I went ahead and killed her.

Also, Iluv is not a crazy psychopath who kills anyone on a whim. He's a follower of Calix, uncivilized and machiavellian.
