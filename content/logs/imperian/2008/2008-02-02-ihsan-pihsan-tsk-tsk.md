Dusty plains nearing hills. (Heartlands.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A common red admiral 
butterfly flits about over your head. A sleek black hound stands stone still, 
ears perked and alert. A demon resembling a large spider idly paces here. The 
undead form of Lord Ihsan Nessaja, Commander of the Storm is here. He wields a 
dwarven battleaxe in each hand.
You see exits leading northeast, east, southwest, and northwest.
