Small mountain farm yard. (Vardarian Highlands.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. This rough, rocky area is barely 
recognizable as a farm yard. A handful of meager cornstalks grow here in the 
few unrocky areas. Large goats roam the area freely. The outer area of the farm
yard needs no fence other than the one that nature provides. The steep, rocky 
mountains make this little farm nearly impregnable. Small paths meander between
the rocks. A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. A noble 
kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you. Hovering in the air is a 
delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its wings. Nervously pacing, 
a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A raven the colour of night 
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. A thorny lizard is
here, hissing menacingly and moving slowly around the room. Silent and 
observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of 
the eye. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. 
Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. 
There are 2 forest of sharpened crystals here. A large wall of stone stands 
here, blocking passage to the west. Elemental Apprentice, Nikka is here. He 
wields an elemental staff in his left hand. Lord Bero Windshire, Captain of the
Five Towers is here. He wields a finely balanced cavalry sabre in each hand. 
General Keijima Elith, Dragoon Lord is here, camouflaged. He wields a hunter's 
spear in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Earthsinger of the 
Claw, Faille, Wildwood Spring Nightingale is here. She is holding a 
golden-stringed harp in her left hand. The ever-shifting visage of Xanthus, 
Aspect of Moradeim, is here. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Sir
Nasr Tellaris, Knight of Kinsarmar is here. He wields a runic totem in his 
hands. Lord Nevore Lokrien is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left 
hand. Lord Doshar Elith, Knight Protector is here. He wields a strong 
broadsword in each hand.
You see exits leading east, southeast, southwest, and west.

Small mountain farm yard. (Vardarian Highlands.?)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. This rough, rocky area is barely 
recognizable as a farm yard. A handful of meager cornstalks grow here in the 
few unrocky areas. Large goats roam the area freely. The outer area of the farm
yard needs no fence other than the one that nature provides. The steep, rocky 
mountains make this little farm nearly impregnable. Small paths meander between
the rocks. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you. 
Hovering in the air is a delicate songbird, prismatic colours reflected in its 
wings. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet. A 
raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady 
black eyes. A thorny lizard is here, hissing menacingly and moving slowly 
around the room. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching 
all with a cunning glint of the eye. Hackles raised, an adult grey wolf sniffs 
the air for enemies. Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly 
flits about the room. There are 3 large wall of stones here. Heated breath 
flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. Heated breath 
flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A stray cat 
wanders around here, searching the ground for food. Tossing his majestic silver
head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. A bell shaped

corpses of a young rat here. There are 49 corpses of a baby rat here. There are
20 corpses of an old rat here. There are 44 corpses of a rat here. There are 9 
corpses of a black rat here. There are 4 soulspears here. A sigil in the shape

right. Elemental Apprentice, Nikka is here. He wields an elemental staff in his
