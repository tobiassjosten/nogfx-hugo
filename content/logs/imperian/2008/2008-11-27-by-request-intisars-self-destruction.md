You recall that Intisar said:
"Seeking someone that can disarm traps."
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb> <b>> 
You recall that Gurn said:
"paying for more traps to be laid. Preferably ones that are more effecient at 
killing. Send tells for prices."
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb> <b>> 
You recall that Intisar said:
"Paying people to ignore Gurn. He is harassing me."
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb> <b>> 
You recall that Gurn said:
"100 gold per trap laid for her, send me some sort of proof and I'll send the 
gold."
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb> <b>> 
(Market): Intisar says, "Gurn, I have already issued you for your constant and 
repeated harassment. Do you want another."

<<Diavlous>>: You say, "Harbinger, the Squire has me snubbed. I hate to go this
far up the chain of command, but can you do something about the disgrace the 
Squire is making of herself and our guild via Market?"

<<Diavlous>>: You say, "After the repeated warnings that the Disciplinarian and
Mortificare have given her?"

(Burt): Sani says, "Bad Elphie."

(Burt): Sani says, "Kill first, ask questions later."

(Burt): You say, "She's already -been- killed. It's time to take it to the next
level."

(Diavlous): Sagron says, "This has gone on long enough."

(Stavenn): Sagron says, "You have 30 seconds to leave the city Intisar, and 
then the guards will remove you."
<401/401h 286/286m 1907e 1334w <eb> <b>> 
(Stavenn): Intisar says, "Why don't you go eat a dick, Imperator?"

(Stavenn): Intisar says, "You could use one."

(Market): Intisar says, "Sagron is a fucktard."

(Market): Intisar says, "FUCK."

(Market): Siyamak says, "Um, help market?"

Miana tells you, "Suicided."

You tell Miana Lynne, "That's SOP."

You sense Intisar has entered Imperian, ready to begin life anew.

You begin to ignore Intisar.

(Newbie): Intisar says, "Attention everyone: Sagron is a fucking dumbass who 
cannot differentiate between OOC and IC. He removed me from the Diavlous for 
completely OOC reasons and cannot roleplay to save his life. This is the true 
reason why Stavenn is deteriorating, because fucktards like him are around."

(Newbie): Intisar says, "Maybe if this game weren't so full of horse-fucking 
dumbasses who didn't PK more than they RP, it would be worth playing."

(Newbie): Skye says, "Intisar, this is not appropriate use of the newbie 
channel. Please find somewhere else if you really want to discuss it."

(Newbie): Orius says, "And then there are appropriate ways to do that."
<401/401h 285/286m 1907e 1334w <eb> <b>> 
(Newbie): Intisar says, "Skye, I don't remember asking you a goddamned thing. 
Why don't you just shut your mouth and listen?"

(Newbie): Lachesis says, "I've handled it. Back to your regular lives."
