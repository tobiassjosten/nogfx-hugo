You follow Leisane to the southwest. (following)
A dark library. (City of Stavenn.?)
A dark sofa stands on the ground here, plush cushions awaiting to be sat upon. 
A solid bookcase of dark, gleaming wood rises high from the floor. Berodach, 
the Unfeeling paces about here. There are 2 black plush armchairs here. A 
monstrous fell beast prowls here, blending with the shadows. A runic totem is 
planted solidly in the ground. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon
the floor, giving off a soft light. A large chest rests in the corner. A sigil 
in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. This is a 
library. Ren Fel'Amrit is here.
You see exits leading northeast and southwest.

In a low voice, Berodach, the Unfeeling orders Ren to approach him.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
With a flourish of his arm, Ren bows deeply.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>>

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to Ren, "While I know you are learning, 
do you wish to join us? I wish to.. introduce your daughter to rituals."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Berodach, the Unfeeling turns away from Ren, the lesson terminated.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Ren nods his head.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Ren Fel'Amrit says, "Aye, I can."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane beckons Ren to him.

Corridor of Shadows.
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An elegant iron and stone 
brazier stands here, casting a modest amount of flickering illumination about. 
Shrouded within deeply hooded robes, Hamdil is barely discernable from the 
shadows. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the 
ground.
You see exits leading north, east, south (open door), west, and up.
Leisane suddenly appears from the shadows of the passage leading up.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane inclines his head toward Hamdil, the pathguide respectfully.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
You follow Leisane to the west.
Within a dark sanctum.
A black stone basin erupts from the floor, its concaved top appearing as a 
gaping maw. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A small table with 
an inverted pentagram etched in its center sits centre of the room. A black 
robe streaked with blood floats here, a scythe emerging held by two hidden 
appendages. Several runes glow faintly from a small iron-bound chest. A sigil 
in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.
You see a single exit leading east.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>>

Within a dark sanctum.
Rising from the floor to tower around you are five massive stone pillars, the 
equidistant placement of these forming the semblance of a pentagram. Completing
the shape these pillars are intended to form, are narrow cracks intersecting 
across eachother within the floor. Multiple, thick rings made of an unknown 
ebon metal are attached to each of the pillars. Every ring seems as though it 
pulses with energy, causing the pillars to vibrate slightly. When examined 
closely, hidden as they may be, enigmatic crimson stains can be seen within the
red marble of the tiles. A sickly green light emanates from the different 
fissures in the floor, illuminating the better part of this antechamber with a 
malevolent visage. Enormous battles between vast demonic armies are displayed 
upon the circular walls with a level of detail no mortal could ever match. 
Large, wooden chimes of varying lengths are attached high upon the walls and 
constantly produce an indistinguishable rhythmic set of tunes. The center of 
this tremendous chamber lies on a much lower level than the rest of the room, 
with several stairs rising upward to meet with the edges of the uppermost 
floor. A black stone basin erupts from the floor, its concaved top appearing as
a gaping maw. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A small table 
with an inverted pentagram etched in its center sits centre of the room. A 
black robe streaked with blood floats here, a scythe emerging held by two 
hidden appendages. Several runes glow faintly from a small iron-bound chest. A 
sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. His 
predatory eyes watching every movement, a wolfish hound stands here 
attentively. Ren Fel'Amrit is here. Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja is here. 
He wields a mithril shield in his left hand and a dark intricately carved cane 
in his right.
You see a single exit leading east.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
A beam of prismatic light suddenly shoots into the room.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
(Ring): Leisane says, "Ignore it, Dregaur."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Dregaur suddenly appears, having travelled down the beam of prismatic light.
He is followed by a black ouroboros.

Dregaur gives Leisane an acknowledging nod.

This basin is made from black stone which gleams brightly even as it reflects 
nothing. The sides of the basin slope down to a base that seems to blend 
seamlessly with the floor, giving the illusion that is erupted from the floor 
and is an integral part of the room.
It weighs about 75 pounds.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to you, "Add your blood to the basin,

Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren sidles into a corner silently.

It is the 24th day of Vita, in the year 565 AD.

emote pries up a chitin plate on her wrist with the point of a bone-handled skinning dagger and pokes at the soft skin underneath. When blood begins to well up, she holds her wrist over the large black stone basin. After a few drops of blood spill forth, she heads toward the center of the pillars, as ordered.

You have emoted: Elphie pries up a chitin plate on her wrist with the point of

Dregaur narrows his eyes and then blinks rapidly, several times.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Dregaur takes a drink from an iron vial.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja flicks his gaze towards Valafar as he enters, 
before centering it upon Elphie once more. As she spills her blood into the 
basin, he smiles, holding his clawed hand over it as well. He squeezes his hand
inward, dark drops of blood dripping into the basin before he shakes his hand 
idly, making his way down the stairs as well.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to you, "Stand a little off-center from

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Do stand in the middle, that is."

Leisane mumbles incoherently.

The air in the chamber grows cooler as Leisane walks amongst the pillars, his 
hand resting on each momentarily as he mumbles under his breath, fingers moving
to sketch small runes upon them as he paces.

<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>>

Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren glances over the runes, pursing his 
lips.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Now then. I will ask all those gathered
that you remain upstairs as I begin."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Only those who's blood has been added 
to the basin are safe to be down here. Any other persons and it may explode 
quite unceremoniously."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
With an oddly gentle touch, Dregaur's Ouroboros caresses his cheek with a 
finger, and they begin to slowly fade away.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Ren nods his head.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
(Diavlous): Neko says, "Out of curiosity, is the partnership with the Noctusari
still defunct as per Lord Ihsan's post a while back?"
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren begins pacing around the outer ring, 
examining the runes drawn onto the pillars as he passes by above.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
You tell Sergeant Neko Savann, "I hope not, since I'm standing in their 
guildhall bleeding out in their basin."

(Diavlous): Sagron says, "I am working on rebuilding that partnership albeit in
a slighty more practical, more clearly defined way."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja straightens himself, blinking once, his eyes 
opening as the colour in his eyes begins to swirl slowly, a focused look 
passing over his features as he rests a hand upon the air in the center of the 
pentagram.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja chants, "I Dachus al Mur'Maran e'Kurah 
Mytckah."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
The temperature spikes immediately, flames rushing along the lines of the 
pentagram, the smell of sulphur filling your nostrils.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja chants, "Sfragh'eratn el Sintakhla Vetarshla."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
The runes on the pillar glow a deep claret, screams echoing along the walls as 
the fiery outlines of a portal begin in the center of the portal, smoke rising 
from the lines of the pentagram.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja shifts his fingers just slightly, turning his 
hand as a smile spreads across his lips.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja chants, "Tashmit, Da Kar."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren comes to the edge of the stairs and 
stops, staring down into the cauldron, clasping his hands behind his back.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
The portal bursts into life, flames spewing from its edges as it expands wildly
before contracting in on itself, settling at a rounded oval.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles and says, "A steady portal to the 
demonic realm, without a focal point."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Valafar raises an eyebrow questioningly.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Occasional shadows pass within the portal, flickering into vague shapes before 
passing once more.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Ren looks about himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "An interesting achievement, one 
requiring intensive preparations..."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Valafar smiles wryly, a look of amusement passing over his features.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to you, "Move closer, please. There is a 
barrier, do not worry, nothing will eat you."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "Obviously you've been busy 
whilst I"ve been asleep."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane grins and nods.

Ren Fel'Amrit mutters, "Bu. .hat would .. very interest...."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to Valafar, "Further, I devised a sort 
of.. shield, as you would say, based off our own sealing techniques."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "It is not perfect, but it keeps most 
things in."
look me
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
She is an armored akrabi and is distinctly hairless. The chitinous white armor 
plating that protects the top of her head has been painted with a variety of 
tattoo-like maroon designs, which are too tiny to make out from a distance. 
Time has rendered them indistinct even up close, and it is almost impossible to
tell what they might once have been. She is smaller than the average human, but
more muscular. Her body, covered in thick plates of armor as it is, seems 
almost beefy in places. Her long, white, segmented tail, like her head, is 
adorned with faint, indecipherable images. Her round eyes have thin pupils, 
which are surrounded by bright azure irises that are in turn shot through with 
streaks of ethereal white. On the ridge above each eye is a pattern of swirling
black tattoos. The colors stand out sharply against her white plating, but the 
edges of the tattoos have blurred and faded. She is wearing a deep brand on the
inside of her wrist, a white fox fur pouch, a glass bubble, a puzzle-piece 
charm bracelet, a rugged pack strung with fur tails, high-heeled black leather 
boots, a plate helm, a sinn and chitin armband, a pair of plated vambraces, a 
large black wool satchel, a militaristic black shirt, a pair of uniform black 
pants, a four-strand bone bead choker, and an ornate silver chainmail bracelet.
She wields a bone-handled skinning dagger in her left hand and a curved sabre 
in her right.

Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says to Leisane, "I trust it's enough 
to keep your little canary safe."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
In the distance you hear the sharp crack of a whip followed by a blood-curdling
scream.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to Valafar, "It will keep her safe, aye, 
but it serves a duel purpose."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
As Leisane speaks, the smaller shadows howl loudly and vanish as a larger one 
approaches, a loud roar heard as the portal shudders, but holds, the shadow 
remaining just on the event horizon.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles and says, "..and that would be the 
other purpose."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "You see, portals as a whole, tend to 
attract attention, as they require immense energies."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Add a little bait, say, the scent of 
mortal life in the form of blood.."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Valafar smirks.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to you, "My dear, do me a favour and 
place your hand just upon the event horizon? Push until you feel resistance, 
then stop."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
The portal stops shuddering as the large shadow paces about the inside of the 
portal, occasional thrusts heard against the barrier.
emote raises a bone-white hand near the barrier and slowly moves it toward the shadow, perpendicular to the floor, until the reverse pressure is notable. 
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>>

As Elphie touches the portal, the shadow roars in rage and rushes the portal 
again, causing small sparks to fly from the edges as it is battered from the 
opposite side.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja tilts his head slightly, moving between the 
portals and brushing a hand at certain spots upon each, a rune glowing at every
spot he touches.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Ren tells you, "OOC: You are on your own. :V Ren isn't moving."

<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja shakes his head, moving within the pentagram 
and taking Elphie's hand, moving it a quarter of an inch closer to the floor, 
smiling as he does so.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja asks you, "Are you ready, my dear?"
'yes, Lord. 
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
You say, "Yes, Lord."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles and says, "Nikt."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
The portal shudders and the shadow stops its assault, the fury turning to fear 
as it turns to run. It is dragged closer, vanishing as red sparks flow over 
Elphie into the floor, flames churning within the portal and enveloping the 
whole of the pentagram.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren arches an eyebrow, stepping back and

The pillars begin to glow a claret red, the colour creeping up to the base to 
envelop the entire chamber, before darkness blossoms within the room, blotching
out all the light before the eerie green glow slowly returns, smoke and sulphur
floating freely through the air.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "A most interesting display, and 
it would certainly explain the absence of the usual foci."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>>

Ren creases his brow in a frown.

Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to Ren, "See to her. She may have a few 
internal injuries, but nothing that won't heal."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren slowly approaches the basin, glancing 
at Elphie briefly.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Ren nods his head.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to Valafar, "While he does that, allow me
to show you what we did."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Ren Fel'Amrit approaches Elphie with a mutter and attempts to hoist her back up
to her feet.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane rests a hand upon one of the pillars, running a clawed finger over the 
stone as a rune starts to glow. He holds out the other, and a tiny flame sparks
to life, wreathing within itself glowing strongly.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles broadly and says to Valafar, "I have 
transformed this chamber into our personal phylactery."

lacking. Much is lost after a few months."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "And then there is of course the danger

Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "Rarely."

Leisane slowly fades into view.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane utters a short incantation, his body slowly fading from sight. Only his
laboured breathing warns you of his presence, and in seconds even this grows 
muffled and silent.

his claws over her chitin.

properly prepared area, and reverse their own connection to their Patron, and 
then.."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles broadly and says, "Nikt."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "Which could also be incredibly 
dangerous."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Aye, I'm aware of this. Such is why I'm
trying to get a few moments in the presence of One so I may.. verify a few 
variable."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Variables."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "The -only- unknown I can't hurdle is 
the mixing of two planes."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "What happens when you bring the 
ultimate power of there to the ultimate power of here?"
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "Cataclysm, perhaps."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "A few realities is a small price, I 
think."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane slowly fades into view.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane utters a short incantation, his body slowly fading from sight. Only his
laboured breathing warns you of his presence, and in seconds even this grows 
muffled and silent.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
(Ring): Leisane says, "Yes, lei is crazy :<."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "Preferably not this one... we've
worked at it a while."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
(Ring): Leisane says, "NO ONE WILL MISS A FEW PLANES OF EXISTENCE."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Mm, perhaps you could assist me, in the
case of such a disaster, of channeling the destruction?"
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles impishly and says, "Perhaps return a 
favour to Kalsurah after all these years."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
A great weight seems to have been lifted from Leisane.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane rubs some salve on his skin.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Valafar chuckles long and heartily.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "Oh, only if we were certain of 
the direction the destruction would flow."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "I'm sure we could test upon something 
with lower yield."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "A wiser action."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "We'd have to choose a reality as our 
target, however."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane sucks thoughtfully on his teeth.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Hmm, perhaps the nothingness?"
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "That might work even better than the 
Nether Realm."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Valafar raises an eyebrow questioningly.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Oh, yes, you weren't here."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "I wasn't entirely truthful when I said 
the portal didn't have a focal point. It did in the sense that it was focused 
upon a specific plane."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "However, if you don't focus one at 
all.. it opens to nowhere."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "It was a black, empty, mass of nothing.
I stuck my hand through it, and all I got was severe frostbite."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Valafar purses his lips contemplatively.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "No sounds echoed through it or into 
it."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "Such a place had only been 
speculated about by others before us."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Aye, there was an accident before I 
could do more tests however, hence is how I knew to keep you above."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "I had someone who did not add to the 
basin enter.. and a few concussions were received."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "Yes, I remember your first... 
experience with that place."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "I was there."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja smiles and says, "Ah, in that instance, yes."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "The instance I refer to is more recent,
of course."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Valafar nods his head.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "I would like to test again, perhaps 
objects or something."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Tie something to some rope and see how 
far it goes."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "What about other beings?"
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "If anything could survive in such 
frigid darkness.. they were not there."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "That's what slaves are for."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Valafar shrugs helplessly.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Mm, true."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Malkavian Enlightener, Valafar Hlomaren says, "I'm sure Nigometh has a few 
worthless ones lying around he hasn't gotten around to putting down."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane's eyes sparkle with amusement.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Mm, I think that is plenty enough for 
now."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "I think it is time I rest, and think 
upon this."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says, "Mm."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane inclines his head toward Valafar respectfully.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
You follow Leisane to the ether.
Entering the gates of Stavenn. (City of Stavenn.)
Waving ominously, a black flag bearing stripes of indigo and gold rustles 
listlessly in the wind. An ancient and oversized tome stands upon a regally 
decorated pedestal here. The dead body of a Tazi archer has been nailed 
brutally to the point of a rigid, black cross. A carved stone bowl rests here, 
cradled in the arms of a prostrate and faceless statue. There are 29 Diavlous 
Knights here. A Kenuba hippopotamus stands here, massive jaws agape. A massive 
groomed black stallion stands here proudly, its large form covered in silver 
battle armour. A magnificent flag, emblazoned with the crest of the Empire 
ripples regally from the columns of the gates. A bench made from old, overly 
used weapons and armour has been placed here. There are 14 elegantly dressed 
Noctusaris here. An elegantly dressed Noctusari is manning a cannon here. He 
has ninety-eight cannon balls. The shrunken head of Toma has been staked into 
the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his face. The 
shrunken head of Ageranu has been staked into the ground here, the last 
torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Sienna has 
been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon 
her face. The shrunken head of Kurayami has been staked into the ground here, 
the last torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of 
Mishka has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still 
visible upon her face. The shrunken head of Zarok has been staked into the 
ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his face. The 
shrunken head of Ninsun has been staked into the ground here, the last torments
of life still visible upon her face. The shrunken head of Sameth has been 
staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his 
face. The shrunken head of Naro has been staked into the ground here, the last 
torments of life still visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Mikhael has 
been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon 
his face. Stamping his golden hooves and tossing his crimson mane, this blooded
warhorse stands here bearing a regal strength. A shaggy grey mustang roams 
warily nearby.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east 
(gate open).
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
A swirling portal opens from the Demon Planes and spits out a pathfinder, then 
vanishes.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja is no longer leading you.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Flame Nocturnal, Leisane Nessaja says to you, "Do take care."
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
You incline your head toward Leisane respectfully.
<397/397h 283/283m 1885e 1319w <eb> <bd>> 
Leisane leaves to the west.
He is followed by a pathfinder.

stands here attentively. A shifty looking man stands in the shadows.
You see exits leading west, and the ominous gates of Stavenn lie to the east
