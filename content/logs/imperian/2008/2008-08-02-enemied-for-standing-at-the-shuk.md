Antioch Shuk. (City of Antioch.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Tents crowd one another on either 
side of the road. With their flaps rolled up it is difficult to tell where one 
tent ends and the next begins. There are boxes and makeshift tables in each 
tent with various wares for sale. The crowd is very loud as people yell to one 
another about the prices they've found for various goods. Now and then the 
voices of some bargainers will be distinct enough to make out the flowery 
curses they are throwing back and forth. This has been marked as holy ground. A
sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A small oil lamp made of tin and 
glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A whimsical hammock of 
midnight blue with dangling moon and star beads rests here, swaying gently. 
There are 10 dwarven stonemasons here. There are 30 Justicar of the Shahs here.
An Antioch cleric is manning a cannon here. She has 121 cannon balls. An 
armoured knight has been chiseled into this shrine, his heavy form set to kneel
before a fierce lion. A huge elephant swings its trunk back and forth here. 
Stretched out upon the floor is a lazy, fat calico cat, gently licking her 
paws. A nimble Shaahri mare trots about. A pike with the decapitated head of 
Arigon has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of Sikran has been 
erected. A pike with the decapitated head of Alystria has been erected. A pike 
with the decapitated head of Velik has been erected. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. An agile black panther is here, 
sleeping soundly. Its head ever moving to catch any sound, a leathery black bat
hangs nearby. Warily pacing around, a golden-headed lion tamarin darts between 
your feet. An anteater plods about bristling angrily. A sleek harpy eagle is 
here, sleeping soundly. Alert to any danger, a striped ocelot paces around. A 
grizzled old rat sits here, fearlessly. The ever-shifting visage of Zerin, 
Aspect of Moradeim, is here. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is 
the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, and northwest.

Discovered by a group of explorers from Stavenn, Kinsarmar soon fell to its
