So, I've been beating up on Xaarin with darts for a while, pretty much just screwing around, and this happens...







You lash out at Xaarin as he turns to flee.
Screaming, Xaarin rushes away to the southeast.
334/391h 235/296m 778e 1154w 36x eb> d>> 
You will throw darts envenomed with metrazol.
334/391h 235/296m 778e 1154w 36x eb> d>> 
Your backup will be to throw darts envenomed with metrazol.
334/391h 235/296m 778e 1154w 36x eb> d>> 
You detect nothing here by that name.
334/391h 235/296m 778e 1154w 36x eb> d>> 
Entering an open doorway. (nothern tower.)
Master Xaarin Agarwaen, Kunteki of Manoa is here. He is surrounded by a glowing
white nimbus. You see exits leading northeast, south, and northwest.
343/391h 221/296m 775e 1152w 36x eb> d>> 
Xaarin doubles over, vomiting violently.
343/391h 221/296m 775e 1152w 36x eb> d>> 
You lash out at Xaarin as he turns to flee.
As you reach out towards Xaarin, he turns to face you, eyes glowing ominously. 
You gasp and recoil as two radiant arcs of white lightning dart forth from 
them, and scream as you feel your entire body enveloped in a terrible burning 
heat which seems to come from deep within you. Writhing in agony, you feel your
blood and skin begin to boil before unconsciousness envelops you.
You have been slain by Xaarin. (all)
