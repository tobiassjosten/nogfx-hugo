clouds. Quite difficult to make out, a ghost floats above the ground here, 
moaning to itself.

You storm towards Zexo.
Aryana's Spring.
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a 
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved 
statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a 
pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist 
lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting 
a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble 
statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, 
the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved 
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his
heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth.
A comfortable leather sofa sits here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating 
the surrounding area with a slight glow. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. A small sign points into a market stall. A bushy 
tailed fox is sniffing around. A noble falcon is perched here, its bright eyes 
regarding you watchfully. Aislygn, Tribal Mahtar is here. She wields a sleek 
javelin in her left hand and a buckler in her right. Youngling Brue is here. 
She wields a buckler in her left hand and a sleek javelin in her right. Conte

He wields a curved sabre in each hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
He withstands your assault and you are deflected harmlessly away.
