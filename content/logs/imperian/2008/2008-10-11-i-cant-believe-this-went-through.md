<318/318h 320/340m 1387e 1556w <eb> <bd>> <(bas FIRE)>e
Dirt road north of a forest. (road). (Vardarian Highlands.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A 
sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An 
obsidian eye sigil is here. Tossing his majestic silver head, a stallion of the
Modin Valley stands here impassively. Lord Ashel Savet is here. He is rapidly 
swinging a sword above his head.
You see exits leading east, southwest, and west.
<318/318h 320/340m 1386e 1556w <eb> <bd>> <(bas FIRE)>
A lithe ferret races beneath Ashel's feet, stripping his blindness defence.
Bristling madly an anteater shreds Ashel with his sharp claws.

You direct your searing gaze towards Ashel.
You negate his third eye defence.

Your mind feels rejuvenated.
<318/318h 340/340m 1386e 1555w <-b> <bd>> <(bas FIRE)>
A striped ocelot lets out a low hiss as it springs at Ashel, biting him 
ferociously.
Ashel begins to bear down on you with his whirling broadsword. (paralyse)
<318/318h 340/340m 1386e 1555w <-b> <bd>> <(bas FIRE)>
You've baffled me!

(((ashel IS TRANSFIXED!!!!)))
Ashel is bedazzled by the sight of a huge gossamer butterfly fluttering wildly.
With a loud roar an agile black panther lunges at Ashel fiercely, rending his 
flesh with its teeth.
<318/318h 340/340m 1387e 1555w <eb> <bd>> <(bas FIRE)>
You direct your searing gaze towards Ashel.

Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, Ashel brings his broadsword crashing 
straight down on your head. Blackness fills your vision and the screams of pain
exploding in your head find no outlet as your entire body is clove asunder.
You have been slain by Ashel.
