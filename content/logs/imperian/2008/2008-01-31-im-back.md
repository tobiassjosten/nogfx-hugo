You aim a flintlock at Ugagi and pull the trigger.
The weapon discharges with a bang, releasing a cloud of smoke.
The shot strikes true, tearing through Ugagi's body.
(((Ugagi. HAS BEEN SLAIN!)))
You have slain Ugagi.
You reach over to comfort Ugagi as he falls to the pk level of Scintillating.

Flintlock kills should have a unique deathsight message.
