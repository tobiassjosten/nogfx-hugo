Debris-choked underground path. (Southwestern Arena.)
A small path connects two chambers of this underground system, very tight and 
narrow but with a fairly high ceiling. Rubble from the collapse of the arena 
grounds is strewn throughout the entire path, nearly blocking the narrow path 
at twists and turns. High above, the ceiling consists of packed dirt, the tree 
roots that poke through at regular intervals clearly form the base upon which 
the dirt is settled. Smoke issues from this mutilated leg, the skin peeled back
by scorching heat. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon 
you. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a massive shire stands here poised
and alert. Squire Arigon Ryusuke is here. He wields a strong broadsword in each
hand.
You see exits leading east and northwest.
