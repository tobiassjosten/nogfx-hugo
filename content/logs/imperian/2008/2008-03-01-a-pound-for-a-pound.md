You raise your muscled arms into the air and, using your entire body for 
leverage, bring them crashing down upon Marrack, who shrieks in pain.
51's screams are quickly cut off as his body is rent apart by the violent 
pounding.
(((Marrack. HAS BEEN SLAIN!)))
You have slain Marrack.
Marrack leaves to the ether.
You earn 402 gold for winning the event!
You look around triumphantly and realize you are the last one standing. You 
have WON the combat free-for-all.
