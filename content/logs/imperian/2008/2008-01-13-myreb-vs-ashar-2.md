Wall at a pillar. (road). (lost) (North Eastern Arena.)
The base of the smaller pillar lies just inside of a large gap in the arena 
wall. Hand holds have been carved into the pillar, providing an easy way to get
to the top, where a causeway can be seen that stretches from the top of the 
smaller pillar to its taller sister. A pike with the decapitated head of 
Vladimire has been erected. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, 
alertly watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of 
night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Nervously 
pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under your feet.
You see exits leading southeast, west, and up.

A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance 
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking 
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of 
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena 
walls to the southwest. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly 
watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of night 
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Nervously pacing, 
a small brown lemming scampers under your feet.
You see exits leading east, south, southwest, and northwest.

A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance 
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking 
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of 
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena 
walls to the southwest. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly 
watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of night 
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Nervously pacing, 
a small brown lemming scampers under your feet.
You see exits leading east, south, southwest, and northwest.

Forested square. (Southeastern Arena.)
The forest has long taken over this section of the arena, tall trees reaching 
high up into the sky. Towering high above even the tallest trees, the twin 
pillars are visible above the tree line, two final testaments to the mortal 
hands and sweat that went into constructing the might arena. Nature is 
gradually taking it back, however, as is clearly evident by the surrounding 
trees and fauna. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching 
all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of night perches nearby
and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Nervously pacing, a small brown 
lemming scampers under your feet.

itself, has settled here. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly 
watching all with a cunning glint of the eye. A raven the colour of night 
perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Nervously pacing,
