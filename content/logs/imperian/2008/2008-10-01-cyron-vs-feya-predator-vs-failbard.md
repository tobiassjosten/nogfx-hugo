Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
A thunderstorm rages in the heavens, and rain blasts down all around you. A 
rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A dark 
sphere rests on a spike of obsidian that erupts from the bloodied springs that 
gush forth from the ruins in a fountain, a grey mist hovers over its surface, 
slowly shifting and billowing. A well-carved statue of light grey granite 
stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A 
shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A plain 
metal chest rests upon the ground here. A detailed statue of light grey granite
sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A
meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an 
ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An
intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean 
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble 
foam about its mouth. The shrunken head of Marravus has been staked into the 
ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his face. The 
shrunken head of Zoe has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of
life still visible upon her face. The shrunken head of Helios has been staked 
into the ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his face. 
The shrunken head of Kildory has been staked into the ground here, the last 
torments of life still visible upon his face. There are 2 the shrunken head of 
Sanis here. A bench made from old, overly used weapons and armour has been 
placed here. A massive bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands of foam 
hanging from its muzzle. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. 
Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. Performer Gemma 
Elandor is here. She wields a small silver flute in her left hand and a 
beechwood mandolin in her right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, and a crumbling pathway leads
