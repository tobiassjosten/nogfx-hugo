You raise your arms above your head, allowing Kai energy to congregate between your outstretched palms.
You thrust your palms forward and a stream of blue light crackles forth to
strike out at Xaarin. Snapping sounds echo through the air as your crippled
victim sinks to the floor.

You feel an aura of rebounding surround you.

A fearsome obsidian hued hound slashes you viciously.

You may drink another healing elixir.

You may eat another toadstool.

You take a drink from a squirrel and wolf carved vial.
Your mind feels rejuvenated.

You have regained your mental equilibrium.

Your aura of weapons rebounding disappears.

You lift Xaarin triumphantly into the air, then yank him down into your raised
knee with back breaking force.
A lash of black energy whips out from Xaarin's armour, striking you.
Xaarin cries out in pain.
