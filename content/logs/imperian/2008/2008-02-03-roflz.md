Alacard says, "Mog me."
<433/361h 310/259m 1706e 1195w 58x <ebpp>>    
(Ring): Alacard has left your ring.
<433/361h 310/259m 1706e 1195w 58x <ebpp>> t alacard
Variable 'target' is set to: alacard
cl
You raise a strong broadsword over your head and begin to swing it in a wide 
circle, gaining speed as you go.
<433/361h 310/259m 1688e 1195w 58x <e-pp>> 
You have recovered balance.
<433/361h 310/259m 1688e 1195w 58x <ebpp>> 
You begin to bear down on Alacard, preparing to destroy him.
<433/361h 310/259m 1689e 1195w 58x <ebpp>> 
Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, you bring your broadsword crashing 
straight down on Alacard's head. With a power that seems to come from on high, 
you cleave asunder his entire body, from head to groin, splitting him in two 
and killing him instantly.
You have slain Alacard.
<433/361h 310/259m 1671e 1195w 64x <ebpp>> facepalm
You place your face in your palm and shake your head in absolute frustration.

PUT MOG UP, NOOB!
