H:325 M:58 <eb b> (+9m)
You feel your flesh burn away and are blinded as you feel what is left of your 
eyeballs slowly run down your face. With a silent scream of agony, your body is
utterly consumed by the inferno, and you cease to possess corporeal form.
You have been slain by Ashel.
You are OUT of the combat free-for-all!
