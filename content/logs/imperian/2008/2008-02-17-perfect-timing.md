This kid attacked Tomast, Ashel killed him, he came back. Cursed and swore and such at Ashel. Sooo....

Orkus arrives from the down.
<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <p> <bd>> 
Orkus cries aloud his rejection of divine grace.
<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <p> <bd>> 
With a look of incredible effort, Tomast the Cleric swings his cane into Orkus.
<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <p> <bd>> 
You snicker softly to yourself.
<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <p> <bd>> 
You are unable to control yourself and begin laughing out loud.
<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <p> <bd>>

<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <p> <bd>> 
Your aura of weapons rebounding disappears. (anti-weapon field)
You lash out with your whip and drag Orkus into the room.
<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <bd>> (smoke pipe with linseed) 
You take a long drag off your pipe, filling your lungs with linseed smoke.
<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <p> <bd>> 
<293/293h 400/400m 1360e 1903w <e-> <p> <bd>> 
Tomast the Cleric swings his staff in a low arc, catching the legs of Orkus and
sending him sprawling.
