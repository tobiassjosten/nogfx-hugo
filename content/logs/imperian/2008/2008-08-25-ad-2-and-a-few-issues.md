Brief:
   Hey You

Description:
   #87 * Sealia 08/25/0:55 "Threesome. Two sisters. Game?" #90 *
   Sealia 08/25/0:57 "There's a catch. We want gold." #92 * Sealia
   08/25/1:00 "200k."#93 * Sealia 08/25/1:01 "Cordilia and me and
   whatever you want." - #94 * Sealia 8/25/1:02 "You get both of us
   and we do what you want and we get 200k." #97* Sealia 08/25/1:07
   "You have five minutes to respond then the proposition
   terminates." --------- Lonely, got the blues or just have a ton
   of pent up rage from being killed by an over powered Wardancer
   who uses nothing but strychnine. Well folk Sealia and her sister
   has provided the solution. For a petty 200k you can have the
   time of your life and these ladies don't kiss and tell. That
   only comes up to thousands a day an offer to refuse, But you
   better act within the next five minute for this special one of a
   kind offer. Act now!

I was assisting a novice with tattoos and stocking my shop out in Tayar. 
Unprovoked, Ryokitsu attacked me and my fiancee Marisa, stealing a large 
quantity of commodities in the process.

one there was a reason he just hasn't asked me in game at all and he is issuing becuase he didn't inrift all of his commodities, if you are helping a novice don't help them in the open with your reflexes off and i had to kill his fiance because she was taking the comms of the ground that droped from my kill. I don't think there is anything against the rules off taking comms from the corpse you kill. This is a pointless issue and an attempt to scare me into giving him his comms back

I was never contacted ingame what anyone was disturbed by this, I think this is an attempted to get me in trouble because I have won every one of our fights
