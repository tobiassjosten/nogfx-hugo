A loud, echoing hoot sounds as a shadow passes overhead. A large, 
brown-speckled horned owl alights on a nearby perch and bends to pull at a 
purple ribbon around one foot. Grasping the attached letter in its beak, it 
drops it into your hands and then takes off into the air with another hoot, 
vanishing from sight.

This letter is made of the finest quality paper, and is rolled into a cylinder,

It has 10 months of usefulness left.
It weighs 1 ounce(s).
