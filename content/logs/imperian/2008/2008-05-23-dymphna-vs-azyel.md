Aryana's Spring. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. A rune
circle has been sketched into the ground here. The spring of crystalline water 
gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a 
shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of 
inspiration and life. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, 
depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue 
of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of 
light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the 
throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses 
here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base 
filled with offerings. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets 
here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a 
ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A comfortable leather sofa 
sits here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a
slight glow. A small sign points into a market stall. Tomast the Cleric stands 
here, his gaze cast over the Springs. Tossing his majestic silver head, a 
stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively. The decapitated head of 
Katar has been carelessly tossed aside. A wooden bowl rests comfortably on the 
ground. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. Elsie, 
Student of the Arcane is here, pouting furiously. Azyel Shinpachi, Initiate of 
Air is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
