Issue #16980   Reported by: Livvy    Re: Lalitana
2008-09-16 01:35:43: 
According to my research, I believe that Lalitana is guilty of violating the
Imperian Terms of Service.  First, I would like to point out that by submitting this issue I genuinely hope that no further punishment comes upon my character, all I want is a non biased third party to review my statements and Lalitana s response if any.  In character I got myself into a situation that could have been perceived as committing crimes against the City of Kinsarmar.  There are two basic charges, the first is extended fraternization with and enemy and the second if fraud (for lying about my actions).  According to the Kinsarmar scrolls, which oddly enough were composed by Lalitana, the punishment for my crimes should have been $5,000 gold for the fraternization and $2,000 gold for the fraud.  Neither of my crimes have a punishment of getting kicked out of the city unless I am a repeat offender, but I have never been charged with any crime before.  Not only was I kicked out of the city, Lalitana instantly repossessed the home that was purchased with several other players.  There has been a lot of time, (RL money) and gold put into the house and I feel that I did not deserve to lose my citizenship, let alone my house.  I feel as though I
have been robbed of my possessions and my opportunity to enjoy Imperian.  
Lalitana clearly violated section 5 (f) of the Terms of Service which she 
agreed upon before creating her character in Imperian.  Section 5 of the TOS 
states that the User may not engage in any conduct or communication while using the Services which in unlawful or which resists or inhibits any other User from using or enjoying the Services. Section 5(f) prohibits Engaging in any unacceptable harassment, as determined solely by the Company, of another user of the Services. California statue defines harassment as the act of systematic and/or continued unwanted and annoying actions of one party or a group, including threats and demands. The purposes may vary, including racial prejudice, personal maliceect.  I

Lalitana has little tolerance for people who break Kinsarmar's laws. Livvy 
committed both of the crimes outlined in her issue - fraternizing with a city enemy and attempting to cover up her crime with obvious lies (statements that she was "yanked in and out of the Saboteur guildhall repeatedly", that Cyron was attacking her at the time, etc). The two crimes listed each carry, separately, fines and citydisfavours. Combined, and given that Livvy had JUST allowed Cyron to rob her sisters shop, they warranted removal from the city rather than multiple fines and two disfavours. Someone who has just been removed from an organization is generally not allowed to keep property there, so Lalitana repossessed the house. Whether or not others contributed to the purchase of said house is not her concern - there is no such thing in Kinsarmar as a "family owned" or "organization owned" home. Regarding the harassment charge, I see no continued or systemic harassment on my part - any contact I attempted with Livvy in an in-character manner has been directly related to Lalitana's position as Erege/Duchess. I have never targeted her for any sort of continued contact, nor have I ever contacted her in an OOC matter or out-of-game. With regards to the loss of "real money", players must agree to a disclaimer when they purchase credits: "[W]hile we guarantee you will not lose any of the credits you buy, no such guarantee can be provided for what you purchase with the credits themselves...as it is a world, your actions have consequences, and the actions of others can result in consequences for you....thus, it is possible that the perceived or real value of the things you purchase with credits, or your ability to use those things, may both rise and decline during the course of play." While Livvy may not like Lalitana's actions or even find them fair, Lalitana's application of in-game rules in a way she deems fit as Duchess is not in any way an indication of "harassment". Likewise, Livvy's loss of credits as a result of investment in property within Kinsarmar falls under Imperianâ€™s credit disclaimer.
