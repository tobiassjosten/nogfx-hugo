Blocked-off underground chamber. (lost) (Southwestern Arena.)
This area is unnaturally flooded with water. The shining figure of a Seraphic 
guardian floats in the air here. Vindicator Ashel Savet, Knight-Captain is 
here. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a twin rose-embossed tower 
shield in his right. Apostle Lestiar Ohmsford is here. He wields a spiritual 
mace in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see a single exit leading west.

The almost imperceptible sound of a burning fuse suddenly runs silent, followed
by such an enormous explosion that you find yourself roughly thrown to the 
ground. Where once stood Ashel, there is only a black and crimson crater as the
smoke clears.
You have slain Ashel.
Ashel leaves to the ether.

A mortal heart still dripping blood is blown about the room, coming to a rest
