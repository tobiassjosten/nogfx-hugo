Aeife tells you, "Well if you think I just let you kill me, you better think 
again, and as for the laying down, ask your girlfriend."

You tell Aeife Pyralis, "Like you ask Niarchos?"

You tell Aeife Pyralis, "As I said. I made an offer."


Aeife tells you, "Heh, I don't have to ask..as soon as he sees me he gets in
