The empty eastern square.
Snowflakes float down around you, colouring the world white. Saint Airen 
S'Sylistha, Lord of the Damned is riding on a black ouroboros. He wields a 
wicked-looking daegger in his left hand and a soulspear in his right. You see 
exits leading east, southwest, west, and northwest.
