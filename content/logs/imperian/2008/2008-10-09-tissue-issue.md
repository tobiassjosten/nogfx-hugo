You inhale deeply, allowing the raging flames to build up inside you. With an 
earth-shaking roar, you release a white-hot jet of fire directly at Dias.
With an instinctive gesture of self-preservation, Dias raises his arms ahead of
himself in terror as the jet of white-hot fire shoots towards him through the 
air. The gesture is futile, as the column of flame incinerates poor Dias 
instantly. For a second his charred skeleton stands transfixed before you, then
crumbles to ashes.
You have slain Dias.
