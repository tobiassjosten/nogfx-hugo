A narrow road through the plains. (road). (Modin Valley.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The plains span out wide and green 
along this stretch of road, patches of wildflowers interspersed throughout, 
while a field of brown earth lies to the east. The field has been cultivated 
and tilled into neat rows, in which various crops have been planted, their 
green shoots visible, just protruding through the ground. The area is fenced 
off with thick hedgerows, which keep out the grazings of the wile animals 
nearby, which can be heard grunting and lowing occasionaly. On either side, the
presence of the hills still looms. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the 
room. Hivarius Arda'Tsian is here. Aidan Askare is here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, west, and 
northwest.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The plains span out wide and green 
along this stretch of road, patches of wildflowers interspersed throughout, 
while a field of brown earth lies to the east. The field has been cultivated 
and tilled into neat rows, in which various crops have been planted, their 
green shoots visible, just protruding through the ground. The area is fenced 
off with thick hedgerows, which keep out the grazings of the wile animals 
nearby, which can be heard grunting and lowing occasionaly. On either side, the
presence of the hills still looms. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the 
room. Hivarius Arda'Tsian is here. Aidan Askare is here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, west, and
