Disintegrated underground wall. (Southwestern Arena.)
The wall of the arena has sunken far into the ground here, broken up into a 
variety of pieces. Parts of the wall seem to stand, pressed into the hard mud 
of the underground chamber, while other parts of it litter the ground in 
varying states of disrepair and ruin. Various forms of moss and other 
underground growth have crept over both the pieces of the wall and the 
remaining sections of it still standing, while tree roots line the ceiling. A 
rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. Lying at your feet is a 
bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and throbbing with life. A small forest of
sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A massive bazwolf paces the floor
savagely, thick strands of foam hanging from its muzzle. Blending in with its

The wall of the arena has sunken far into the ground here, broken up into a 
variety of pieces. Parts of the wall seem to stand, pressed into the hard mud 
of the underground chamber, while other parts of it litter the ground in 
varying states of disrepair and ruin. Various forms of moss and other 
underground growth have crept over both the pieces of the wall and the 
remaining sections of it still standing, while tree roots line the ceiling. 
Lying at your feet is a bloodied and mangled arm, still warm and throbbing with
life. There are 2 forest of sharpened crystals here. A massive bazwolf paces

Collapsed arena path. (Southwestern Arena.)
The path leading down to the underground here collapsed with a little less 
rampant destruction than in the other exits of the underground. It gradually 
leads up from here, broken at pitted at times but in relatively good condition 
considering the abrupt collapse of the path in other areas. Small tunnels 
branch off from this room into the rest of the underground. A swirling vortex 
floats here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the 
ground. Smoke issues from this mutilated leg, the skin peeled back by scorching
heat. A massive bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands of foam hanging
from its muzzle. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the 
ground. Vindicator Sarrius Chytovil, Knight-Major is here. He wields a runic 
totem in his hands. The ever-shifting visage of Khizan, Aspect of Moradeim, is 
here.
You see exits leading north, west, and up.

A rubble covered archway. (road). (Southeastern Arena.)
The arena's walls meet here at a large ruined archway, originally the entrance 
to the arena grounds. The walls are now pitted and falling, and portions of the
archway have tumbled to the ground, creating piles of rubble that make walking 
through this area treacherous. A large forest seems to have reclaimed much of 
the arena to the northwest, while a large open space looms inside the arena 
walls to the southwest. A rune circle has been sketched into the ground here. A
sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A massive
bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands of foam hanging from its 
muzzle. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. 
Vindicator Sarrius Chytovil, Knight-Major is here. He wields a runic totem in 
his hands. The ever-shifting visage of Khizan, Aspect of Moradeim, is here.
