A swirling vortex violently spins about the room.

A swirling vortex violently spins about the room.
A dark, swirling vortex opens up to the northeast and spits out Talash onto the
floor before closing.
Talash's attention is grabbed and held by a nairat rune.
Talash's limbs lock up as his eyes meet an inguz rune on a totem.
Talash's eyes close suddenly as he falls asleep.

You cease to prop up a tall totem pole.
You cease to wield a runic totem.
<351/351h 419/419m 1658e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
You aren't wielding anything.

You aren't wielding anything.
<351/351h 419/419m 1658e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
You begin to wield a strong broadsword in your left hand.
<351/351h 419/419m 1658e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
You begin to wield a strong broadsword in your right hand.
<351/351h 419/419m 1658e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
You strengthen your grip until your fists are rock solid. (gripping)
<351/351h 419/419m 1658e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
You raise a strong broadsword over your head and begin to swing it in a wide 
circle, gaining speed as you go.
<351/351h 419/419m 1640e 1998w 46x <e-> <bd>> 
The air feels stagnant and dead here.
<351/351h 419/419m 1640e 1998w 46x <e-> <bd>> 
Your sketch fails as there is no longer a rune circle here.
You have recovered balance.
<351/351h 419/419m 1640e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
A swirling vortex violently spins about the room.
<351/351h 419/419m 1641e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
You begin to bear down on Talash, preparing to destroy him.
<351/351h 419/419m 1641e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
Talash opens his eyes and yawns mightily.
<351/351h 419/419m 1641e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
A swirling vortex violently spins about the room.
<351/351h 419/419m 1642e 1998w 46x <eb> <bd>> 
Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, you bring your broadsword crashing 
straight down on Talash's head. With a power that seems to come from on high, 
you cleave asunder his entire body, from head to groin, splitting him in two 
and killing him instantly.
You have slain Talash. (Damage: 0)
Defeated, Talash is cast out of the Arena.
