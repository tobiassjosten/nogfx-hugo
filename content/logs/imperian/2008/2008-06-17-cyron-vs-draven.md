gaze cast over the Springs. His eyes dulled from constant fear, a muamrite 
slave wanders aimlessly. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse
stands here imperially. Trainee Aska is here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in 
each hand. Incinerate Draven Acerbus, Messenger of 'Ab is here.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway

The slave looks at you with hatred in his eyes, edging himself away.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a 
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved 
statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a 
pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist 
lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting 
a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble 
statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, 
the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved 
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his
heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth.
A comfortable leather sofa sits here. A small sign points into a market stall. 
A spirited Shaahri stallion trots about. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. His eyes dulled from constant fear, a muamrite 
slave wanders aimlessly. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse
stands here imperially. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and
alert. A feral demon has been slain and left here to rot. A stray cat wanders 
around here, searching the ground for food. The undead remains of a large 
spider is here. Trainee Aska is here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each 
hand. Incinerate Draven Acerbus, Messenger of 'Ab is here, sprawled on the 
ground.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a 
fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among
the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A well-carved 
statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a 
pose of utter cowardice. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist 
lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting 
a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A meticulous marble 
statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, 
the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. An intricately carved 
statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his
heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth.
A comfortable leather sofa sits here. A small sign points into a market stall. 
A spirited Shaahri stallion trots about. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. His eyes dulled from constant fear, a muamrite 
slave wanders aimlessly. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse
stands here imperially. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and
alert. A feral demon has been slain and left here to rot. Trainee Aska is here.
He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each hand. Incinerate Draven Acerbus, 
Messenger of 'Ab is here, sprawled on the ground.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.

The empty western square. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant 
clouds. A large lizard is here, sunning itself happily. His eyes dulled from 
constant fear, a muamrite slave wanders aimlessly. A sleek black hound stands 
stone still, ears perked and alert. The decaying remains of Draven lie here. A 
small red juniper berry has been dropped here. Twinkling and gleaming, a large 
pile of golden sovereigns rests on the ground.
You see exits leading northeast, east, southeast, southwest, and west.
