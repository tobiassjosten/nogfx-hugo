Knight Commander Khizan Vladin, Ranger of the Wildwood says, "Vorrak."
An orc guard says, "You look suspicious ta me, but I'm not da boss. In yinz

As you walk through the door, it slams shut behind you.
A hidden mine shaft. (Vorrak Mines.)
A piece of stone sticks out from the wall, its jagged point smoothed from use. 
The skeletal remains of a rogue bandit lie here, twin blades rusting nearby. An
ogre watchman stands here ready and armed for battle. Plodding along on his 
assigned task, an orc miner stops to catch a quick breath.
You see exits leading up (closed door), and a wooden ladder leads down.

Flipping his large shield sideways, an ogre watchman spins it towards you.
Your shield absorbs some of the damage.
Your steelweave surcoat completely absorbs the damage.

A hidden mine shaft. (lost) (Vorrak Mines.)
A piece of stone sticks out from the wall, its jagged point smoothed from use. 
The skeletal remains of a rogue bandit lie here, twin blades rusting nearby. An

assigned task, an orc miner stops to catch a quick breath.
A closed door obscures your vision.
