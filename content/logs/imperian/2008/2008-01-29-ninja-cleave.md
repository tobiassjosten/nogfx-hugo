H:304 M:252 E:1440 W:1432 <eb db> (north) 
Forge of the Lion. (City of Antioch.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A large hammock threaded together with 
silver rope and adorned with silver dove trinkets swings in the breeze here. 
Marked with distinguishing white and black fur, a large panda bear is here 
munching lazily on a bamboo stalk. A massive groomed black stallion stands here
proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. Its beady eyes 
searching for some new prey, a lithe black fox slinks around the area. A silk 
pack lies on the ground. Erus Notine Scrae'Uden, Occisor Prodigii is here. He 
wields a shining longsword in his left hand. You see a sign here instructing 
you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading south and northwest (closed door).

apply mass

You concentrate and are once again Ssylsin.
H:304 M:252 E:1442 W:1390 <-b db> 
You quickly rub some salve on your skin.
Your body grows extremely dense and heavy as the mass salve infuses your skin.
H:304 M:252 E:1442 W:1390 <-b db> 
You may apply another salve.
H:304 M:252 E:1442 W:1390 <-b db> 
You have regained your mental equilibrium.
H:304 M:252 E:1443 W:1390 <eb db> block s
cleave not

You move over to block the south exit.
H:304 M:252 E:1442 W:1390 <eb db> 
You raise a dwarven battleaxe over your head and begin to swing it in a wide 
circle, gaining speed as you go.
H:304 M:252 E:1424 W:1390 <e- db> 
You have recovered balance.
[23:09:52:219]
H:304 M:252 E:1425 W:1391 <eb db> 
Notine tries to leave, but you block him from moving that way.
H:304 M:252 E:1425 W:1391 <eb db> 
You begin to bear down on Notine, preparing to destroy him.
H:304 M:252 E:1425 W:1391 <eb db> 
"Ummmm," Notine says uncertainly.
H:304 M:252 E:1426 W:1391 <eb db> 
Notine tries to leave, but you block him from moving that way.
H:304 M:252 E:1426 W:1392 <eb db> 
Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, you bring your battleaxe crashing 
straight down on Notine's head. With a power that seems to come from on high, 
you cleave asunder his entire body, from head to groin, splitting him in two 
and killing him instantly.
You have slain Notine.
H:304 M:252 E:1409 W:1392 <eb db> blackwind

You call upon your dark power, and instantly a black wind descends upon you. In
seconds your body begins to dissipate, and you are one with the odious vapour.
