The arrow's fuse disappears within the black packet tied to the shaft, and all 
is quiet for a moment. You don't even have time to witness your life flashing 
before your eyes as the packet explodes violently, white fire the last thing 
you see as your body is blown to nothing more than charred bone and vaporized 
flesh.
You have been slain by Isabella. (all)


Isabella tells you, "I feel horrible but alls fair from last time. I wont do it
again."

Isabella tells you, "It was weak."

(Burt): Anarion says, "I should've gotten a hammer tattoo and dropped the knife
sigils I had."

(Burt): Isabella says, "But regardless, I'm sorry. It was incredibly funny but 
sitll lame haha."

(Burt): You say, "If Brydian wins because of the 800 scavenger hunts."

(Burt): You say, "Its on your shoulders. :<."

(Burt): Isabella says, ":( don't worry, I'll help you get the points up. And if
it makes it up to you, I'll lay 500 or so snares and enemy brydian during the 
scavenger hunts."

(Burt): You say, "That was worse than what Gurn was doing. :p."


(Burt): You say, "You want to lame me."

(Burt): You say, "And I will lame you much harder. :p."


Tallasar tells you, "I can't believe she did it. And then came it to web, I was
like :O."

You tell Duke Tallasar Kith'Vahni, Symphony of Vindication, "I typo'd the 
pull."

You tell Duke Tallasar Kith'Vahni, Symphony of Vindication, "But whatever."

Tallasar tells you, "I don't like your nerdrages =/."

Tallasar tells you, "They're scarier than normal peoples, cause you're calm 
too."

You tell Duke Tallasar Kith'Vahni, Symphony of Vindication, "I'm not a fan of 
being betrayed like that."

You tell Duke Tallasar Kith'Vahni, Symphony of Vindication, "Especially when 
the only reason for it is nerd raging over losing in the 1v1."



(Burt): Isabella says, "Tallasar tells you, "Ashel tells you, "Isa's getting 
vortex totem judged." Ashel tells you, "Next FFA."."."

(Burt): You say, "Yeah."

(Burt): You say, "I am going to :p."

(Burt): You say, "I was trying to be pretty chill about it."

(Burt): You say, "With my insurance against getting teamed, then roving around 
once it was clear."

(Burt): Isabella says, "You humiliated me with retardation last time. I wasn't 
about to have it happen again."

(Burt): You say, "So you're justifying it with retardation nerd rage over 
losing the 1v1. :p."



(Burt): Sameth says, "Ashel, last ffa you ran a cleric/lorekeeper/mage team."

(Burt): Sameth says, "And vortex/killed everyone."

(Burt): You say, "When we took on 9 people as 3."

(Burt): You say, "Yes."

(Burt): You say, "Is that unfair odds? :p."



(Burt): You say, "Thats what pisses me off, now that I think about it."

(Burt): You say, "I died because I had to fucking get past his hail of sketches
and shield."



In short, if you want to malign me as having some 'team ashel' when I've been trying to be as fair as possible while not losing solely because of other people decide to team, go ahead.
