Wolf's Run. (Ithaquan Council.)
An Idrasi wolfrider is manning a netthrower here. He has 102 nets. A large dog 
watches his surroundings dutifully. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey 
wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. The shining figure of a 
Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. The ever-shifting visage of Bailey, 
Aspect of Moradeim, is here. Dylandil Agarwaen is here, hidden. He wields a 
jagged black sitara in his left hand. You see a sign here instructing you that 
WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading west (open door), and a square trapdoor leads down 
(closed door).
