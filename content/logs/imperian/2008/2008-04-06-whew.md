Hallway of the Spirit. (Wytchen Guildhall.)
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a 
small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. His fur a dusky ash colour, Ashen
sits quietly in one corner.
You see exits leading south and up.
You spy a fehu rune on a totem.
You feel incredibly tired, and fall asleep immediately. (wake)

Your attention is grabbed and held by a fascinating butterfly-like rune.
A viper-like sleizak rune suddenly extends from a totem to bite you painfully. (cyanide)
