Vorine says, "... here's to trying something once..."
<320/353h 268/268m 1416e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>> 
Sickly red rings form around Vorine's eyes as a thin film of sweat begins 
breaking out on her skin.
<320/353h 268/268m 1416e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>> 
Vorine swoons slightly, blinking involuntarily as her eyes are stung with 
streaming sweat.
<320/353h 268/268m 1416e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>> 
Face paling suddenly, Vorine grips her stomach in pain.
<320/353h 268/268m 1416e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>> 
Vorine staggers once before doubling over as she vomits violently, spewing 
forth a thick, unpleasantly green substance stinking of decay.
<320/353h 268/268m 1416e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>> 
Bloody mucus seeps from Vorine's tearducts, running down her face and 
collecting on her lips and chin. Suddenly buckling, her legs give out beneath 
her and she hits the ground hard, bewilderment settling over her grotesque 
features.
<320/353h 268/268m 1416e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>> 
The poison in her system finally overtaking her, Vorine vomits once more, this 
time a bloody combination of liquefied flesh and the contents of her stomach as
her internal organs hemmorhage. She collapses completely to the ground, her 
eyes filling up with blood, her lungs drawing their last breath.
You reach over to comfort Vorine as she falls to the pk level of Vanguard.
Vorine drops a ivory white bone.
Vorine drops some golden sovereigns onto the ground.
<320/353h 268/268m 1416e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>>
You say, "Ahahah."
<320/353h 268/268m 1416e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>>
Raising his hands to the sky, Kraven summons a mighty hailstorm.
Hailstones the size of your fist pour from above, battering your body.
<293/353h 268/268m 1411e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d> <-27>> 
You pick up the corpse of Vorine.
<293/353h 268/268m 1411e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>> 
You pick up some gold sovereigns.
<293/353h 268/268m 1411e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>>
You put 1337 gold sovereigns in a rugged pack strung with fur tails.

----

You put a grilled wolf steak into an elegant white letter.
<286/353h 268/268m 1420e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>> 
You hand your letter to the brutish redcap, who snatches it away. He whistles 
for a bird, and when it doesn't appear he disappears below the counter for a 
moment. After a good bit of cursing and squawking, a raven flaps out shakily, 
holding your letter. The redcap emerges from below, bearing a few new 
scratches, and eyes you grumpily as though daring you to comment.
<286/353h 268/268m 1420e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>>

(Market): Azyel says, "Seeking the person who sent me the Steak."
<286/353h 268/268m 1424e 1241w 29x <ebpp> <d>>
Azyel has been slain by misadventure.
