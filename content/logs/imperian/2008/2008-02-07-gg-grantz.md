You tell Paladin of Vahin, Lord Grantz Vuh'uni, The Supreme Invoker, "Tell me, 
how honorable is blowing up your falcon?"

Grantz tells you, "Also if you didn't hear me the first time."

Grantz tells you, "Dranor himself said that was a bug."

You place your face in your palm and shake your head in absolute frustration.
