[33mUpon an ominous floating platform.[1;31m ([0mCity of Stavenn.[1;31m)[0m
[36mA large dusty tome has been discarded by its owner. A small package, wrapped in[0m
[36ma grey cloth and tied with twine lies on the ground here. A pentagram of [0m
[36mgleaming blood hovers slightly above the platform here, its form shrouded with [0m
[36mswirling mists of eerie energies. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular [0m
[36mmonolith is on the ground. Screaming warcries and seeking out new victims to [0m
[36mslay, a swordslave stands here, the sword in her hand dripping with blood. A [0m
[36msmall globe of writhing worms hovers in the air, stinking of sulphur and rot. [0m
[36mDiseased flesh hanging from twisted bones, a slachta demon squats gibbering in [0m
[36mthe corner, the very ground beneath its feet sickened by its touch. A runic [0m
[36mtotem is planted solidly in the ground.[1;36m Leralonde Agarwaen is here, shrouded. [0m
[1;36mThe undead form of Keeper Eiki Savet, the Scourge of Aetherius is here.[0m
[1;34mYou see a single exit leading west[0;37m.[0m

[37mYou nod your head.[0m

[1;36mYou say, "I'm going to summon a demon into a mutant rat."[0m

[37mThe segments of your tail click faintly as it sways behind you.[0m

[37mYou nod your head.[0m

[37mYou have emoted: Cyron uses a silver dagger to cut into his hand, using the [0m
[37mblood to form a pentagram.[0m

[37mYou have emoted: Cyron drops the corpse of the mutant rat into the center of [0m
[37mthe pentagram.[0m

[1;36mYou say, "Could someone animate it, please?"[0m

[37mGathering his precious essence, Eiki closes his eyes and concentrates. His [0m
[37mmortal frame begins to shake as he slowly drains the smallest portion of his [0m
[37mown life into the corpse of a hulking mutant rat. The corpse of a hulking [0m
[37mmutant rat screams in rage as the soul enters the body.[0m
[37mThe corpse of a hulking mutant rat rises from the ground in undeath.[0m

[37mYou nod your acknowledgement of Eiki.[0m

[1;36mYou say, "Thank you."[0m

[37mYou have emoted: Cyron slices into his hand again, and scrawls protection runes[0m
[37malong the inner side of the circle, before doing more elaborate runes along the[0m
[37moutside.[0m

[37mShadows appear from the edges of the circle, slowly crawling around the rat [0m
[37mbefore they make a perfect sphere.[0m

[37mYou have emoted: Cyron closes his eyes and mutters a short chant, and then [0m
[37mopens a gate to the pit.[0m

[37mThe mutant rat suddenly stops moving, looking around with a vague expression.[0m

[37mSuddenly his head swivels back and looks at his tail, as surprised as a rat can[0m
[37mbe, which shrivels up and falls to the ground in dust.[0m

[37mHis fur begins to turn white, and falls to the ground, and his claws elongate, [0m
[37mturning into razor sharp knifes. His ears shrink, and then disappear, and his [0m
[37mstunted nose shrinks back into the rat's head.[0m

[37mThe mutant's eyes suddenly start to expand, stopping just short of bulging out [0m
[37mof their sockets. Cyron walks closer to the rat, before muttering another [0m
[37mchant, as the rat screams in almost human-like agony.[0m

[37mSuddenly, another gate opens, and fiery tendrils lash out from them, leeching [0m
[37monto the rat. His sharp claws dig into the ground as he is dragged back to, and[0m
[37mthrough, the gate into hell.[0m

[37mBefore closing, a scream of inhuman pain and suffering can be heard from the [0m
[37mgate, which is cut off abruptly.[0m

[37mYou have emoted: Cyron walks around the edge of the pentagram, and smudges the [0m
[37mouter runes, and then the inner ones. The shadows which encompassed the circle [0m
[37mfade away, and Cyron dispels the pentagram.[0m

[1;36mYou say, "I believe we're done, then."[0m

[1;36mKeeper Eiki Savet, the Scourge of Aetherius says, "Good job."[0m

[1;36mLeralonde Agarwaen says, "Good fun to watch as well."[0m

[1;36mYou say, "Thank you."[0m

[37mYou give a mischievous grin.[0m
