Jeid leaves to the north.
Rinaldi rolls his eyes.
"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.
Sir Rinaldi Sunjackal, Knight of Khandava says, "I'm not one to give wytchen a 
moment, personally."
You say, "I'd just start up a cleave."


Rinaldi raises a curved sabre over his head and begins to swing it in a wide 
circle, gaining speed as he goes.
[ *** Warning!! CLEAVE/BEHEAD!!! *** ]

The harmonic vibrations of the room refresh your mind and body.

Jeid takes a drink from a cedarwood vial.
H:332/309(0) M:424/424(0) E:1409 W:687 XP:89 <eb bd> 
Screaming out a warcry of pure strength, Rinaldi brings his sabre crashing 
straight down on the head of Jeid. With unbelievable power, Rinaldi's sabre 
rips through Jeid's entire body, cleaving it asunder and killing him instantly.
Jeid has been slain by Rinaldi.
Jeid drops a length of rope.
Jeid drops a spool of cloth.
Jeid drops a length of rope.
Jeid drops a linseed.
