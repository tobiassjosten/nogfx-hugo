You say, "Have you ever experimented with fire?"

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Not really."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Red is my only color of fire, and I've always used it to destroy my enemies."

You say, "That is what red is best used for."

Kalell lowers the butt end of the staff to the ground and mutters something 
under his breath. Kalell then slowly starts to twirl his staff until a small blue fire flickers from the ruby. The fire begins to encompass the entire staff until even the hand which holds it becomes covered in blue flame.

Kalell quits twirling his staff and slams the staff into the ground. The 
flames subside.

Kalell lowers his staff once again and mutters under his breath. Within seconds,the black wood of the staff begins to flicker and turn white. Kalell begins twirling the staff faster and faster until nothing but a blur of white can be seen. A radiant energy begins pouring out of Kalell until he becomes a giant ball of light. Almost immediately, the light dies away and Kalell stands panting, the staff turned black once again.

You say, "That's never happened before."

Kalell leans on his staff and attempts to recover his breath.

You say, "That scared me."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Imagine if it made you phase but then you could never return."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "You'd become a ghost."

You say, "That's not funny."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "I would laugh though."

You say, "Playing with the unstable is never funny."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Do it again!"

Therian urges you onwards.

You say, "Let me catch my breath."

Kalell lowers his staff once again and mutters under his breath. He continues to speak unheard words as his eyes close. Kalell begins twirling the staff, slowly at first, but quickly gaining speed until nothing but a blur of black energy can be seen. The staff and Kalell as one continue spinning causing dizzying blasts of energy to radiate. Almost immediately, the darkness dies away and Kalell falls to the ground in exhaustion.

"Damn it!" you swear in frustration.

You say, "I have no idea what just happened."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Keep trying."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Maybe one day you can generate a big enough energy ball to destroy stavenn."

You say, "That was never my intention."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "It is now."

You look about yourself, rubbing your chin thoughtfully.

Kalell slams his staff into the ground and begins waving his hands in a 
ritualistic manner. Kalell places his hands over the other, palms facing each other. He then begins to mutter strange words under his breath as a small blue flame flickers out ofthe top of the staff. Kalell places his hands on the fire and somehow pulls the flame away from the staff. Varying shades of blue can be seen at different angles from the fire in the palm of his hand. He then uses the flames and runs them over his arms and legs in 
quick motions. Kalell falls backward and lands on his back as he continues to run his hands over his body in a fast movements. The blue fire continues to flicker until he clamps his hands shut. Kalell stands, goes over to the staff and removes it from the ground, his body healed back to new.

You say, "Took me a long time to realize blue was such a strong healing mechanism."

You say, "But it comes at a price. Pain."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Nothing comes without a 
price."

You say, "Well spoken."

You say, "Next time you are back in your elemental suit, you should try using blue fire. It's rudimentary but takes a great deal of feeling to produce."

You say, "It's painful at first, but then you realize the pain is actually soothing."

You say, "But then again, healing isn't for everybody. I'm still not very good at it."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "I might just have to try that."

You say, "I just wish I could figure out purple. I can conjure it, I can see it, I can feel it. But I can't manipulate it. It just sits there, taunting me."

You say, "It's like I can hear it laughing."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Maybe it just wants to be left alone!"

You say, "It has this...magical property to it that I can't even begin to probe."

You say, "I think you may be right. But curiosity is getting the best of me."

Kalell slams his staff into the ground and backs several feet away.

You say, "Might want to move."

Kalell closes his eyes and focuses intently upon an unseen source. The room goes completely silent as he begins speaking softly, "El'tharu. Tinunim. Salaarey." He begins moving his hands in a spiraled pattern in front of his chest continuing to speak softly. A small purple flame begins to flicker atop the staff. Kalell drops to his knees and begins moving his hands up and down in a slow motion. The purple flame comes to life and dances softly.

Kalell rises and slowly walks toward the staff. He puts his hand out as if to touch the flame. A moment before touching it, something flashes in front of Kalell and he pulls his hand back sharply.

You say, "See?"

You say, "I want to touch it. I want to feel it. But I can't."

Kalell watches the flame for many moments before finally dropping to his 
knees several feet away.

Kalell continues to stare at the flame, obviously entranced.

You whisper to Therian, "Try touching it?"

Therian gazes thoughtfully at you for a moment before shaking his head, sagely dismissing the notion.

You nod your head.

Kalell lifts his hands up and says, "I am a friend. Peace."

Kalell rises and once again walks toward the flickering flame. The flame 
grows in response and begins slithering down the staff, encompassing the entire black wood in a purple haze.

Kalell slows to a halt and drops down to study the base of the staff.

Kalell runs his hands along the staff, not quite touching it, trying to 
get a sense of the energy that has taken hold of his staff.

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Maybe it's meant to bolster your intelligence."

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "Maybe it could help you study with greater efficiency."

Kalell stands, turns, and raises his hands in the air saying, "Stop. Whatever it is you want, you can't have. Begone energy." The staff grows to a deep violet color and starts shaking in the ground. Small bolts of purple lightning strike the ground around the staff and the ground begins to crack. Kalell turns back towards the staff and focuses intently on it. He begins waving his hands in intricate motions, muttering under his breath. The purple energy grows and begins to wash over Kalell. The staff and Kalell, as 
one, begin to flash purple, then blue, then yellow, and back to purple. Kalell drops to his knees, puts his hands over his ears and cries out, "STOP IT. STOP!" The staff lifts out of the ground and hovers in midair, purple flames pulsating vibrantly. With a roar of crackling intensity, the staff slams back into the ground, the purple flame gone.

Therian gives you a concerned look.

Kalell says in short breaths, "What...what...was that? What...happened?"

Therian Shaolar, The Lord of Storm's Reach says, in Sylayan, "It tried to eat you or something like that."

You say, "I."

You say, "I...

You give a pained sigh.

You say, "I...saw things."

You shudder violently as a chill ripples down your spine.

You sit yourself down.

You say, "I need a drink."

You gulp down whiskey, wetting your palate.

You say, "I need some time in solitude. I have a lot to figure out."

You bow respectfully to Therian.

Therian bows respectfully to you.
