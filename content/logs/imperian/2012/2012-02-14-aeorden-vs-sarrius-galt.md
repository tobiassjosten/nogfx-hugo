Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A glowing red flame-shaped sigil has been left here. A sassy miniature dog with a fluffy merle coat prances about energetically here. An enormous black warhound paces around here, white fangs bared in a menacing snarl. Warily pacing around, a golden-headed lion tamarin darts between your feet. Alert to any danger, a striped ocelot paces around. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. Preening her wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. A lithe and sleek black panther prowls menacingly nearby. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a gladiator's trident in his left hand and a throwing axe in his right. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.

Nearing the northern city. (road). (Vardarian Highlands.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A glowing red flame-shaped sigil has been left here. The corpse of Sarrius is here, impaled by a narrow bone. A note on it reads, 'This is the end of those who would trifle with Aeorden.'  A maidenhair leaf lies here. Its head proudly held high, a majestic stallion stands here, its veritum armour positively shining. An enormous black warhound paces around here, white fangs bared in a menacing snarl. Warily pacing around, a golden-headed lion tamarin darts between your feet. Alert to any danger, a striped ocelot paces around. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. Preening her wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. A lithe and sleek black panther prowls menacingly nearby. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana. Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. 
You see exits leading northeast and south.

Nearing the northern city. (road). (Vardarian Highlands.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A glowing red flame-shaped sigil has been left here. The corpse of Sarrius is here, impaled by a narrow bone. A note on it reads, 'This is the end of those who would trifle with Aeorden.'  A maidenhair leaf lies here. Its head proudly held high, a majestic stallion stands here, its veritum armour positively shining. An enormous black warhound paces around here, white fangs bared in a menacing snarl. Warily pacing around, a golden-headed lion tamarin darts between your feet. Alert to any danger, a striped ocelot paces around. A raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Poised nervously on slender legs, a pronghorn antelope stands here. Preening her wings idly, a sleek harpy eagle is perched nearby. A lithe and sleek black panther prowls menacingly nearby. A sassy miniature dog with a fluffy merle coat prances about energetically here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana.
You see exits leading northeast and south.
