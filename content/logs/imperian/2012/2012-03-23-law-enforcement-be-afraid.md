Issue #102087   Reported by: Shaylei    Re: Alceus
2012-03-20 21:26:50: 
He attacked Shaylei as she was hunting, now mind you she had not attacked nor provoked this attack, which lead to her death to an orc.  Then just a few moments later, Shaylei was hunting with Yurii and Alceus once again decided that he was going to attack again. Shaylei and Yurii fought back which lead to Alceus' death at Shaylei's hands. Alceus since then has sought her out and trying attacking many times, the last being at a shardfall which he really had no place being as he does not belong to a city. After he claimed his kill on her he continued to harass me the player through a clan  noted here: (Mania): Alceus says, "Shaylei, you are literally one of the most annoying, angering, stupid people I have ever met in my life. You whore around to get people to like you, but nobody does. You act like you're big shit and then you get fucked and cry to daddy and mommy. You make me laugh and want to kill myself at the same time." I am aware that I can turn the clan off but others asked him to stop the behavior therefore it was disturbing more than one person. As Noted here, 3 ) Ike: "Gees, take it out elsewhere. We really don't have to hear all that."  His language is less 
than acceptable. And his constant attacks are futile and I am sick of this harassment. Thank you for your time.

Clans are OOC, can't be issued for. As for the attacks, the last one, Alceus is a member of the Diavlous, he has every reason to be at a shardfall to help. The one where Shaylei died to an orc wasfor trespassing in the Wytchen guildhall, which Alceus was a member of until about 40 minutes ago. And the one with her and Yurii was actually meant for Yurii, who also issued me. I'm tired of peoplefiling spurious issues because they're mad that they died or mad that I said something they didn't like.

Continual harassment, seeking Shaylei out and killing her and Zachariah. He has no reason to attack her nor Zachariah. THIS IS HARASSMENT. To top it off he killed my wolf, it was not even attacking him. This is enough, this is not RP this is pure harassment. I want nothing to do with him, and he better not want anything to do with me. He keeps this up and I am involving the law. I am sick of the harassment.

I don't even know how to reply to this. It's absurd, sad, and hilarious at the same time. Settle to say Alceus has valid PK reason on Shaylei for retaliation attacks. And the rest.....I'll just pretend I didn't read it. Even though, honestly, it made me laugh so hard I almost died

This is harassment. Alceus seems to have nothing better to do then to attack Shaylei. He has claimed his due kill, and any further action is now harassment. I want no further contact between his or my characters. I have no desire to Role play with nor does he with me. Therefore all his actions are OOC and irrelevant to the development of the game. He continues to harass me, and those that are by my Characters side. I am sick of this behavior. Please help in this matter

This an irrelevant issue, as Alceus attacked and killed Zachariah, not Shaylei. The only reason Shayleiw as attacked is because she jumped in to help Zachariah.

Repeated kills with no RP reason. Alceus had killed Zachariah once for defending Shaylei. This kill is not in dispute. He came to Antioch with the express reason of killing Zachariah, he did not even try to disguise it by attempting to bash locusts. He has been repeatedly issued by Shaylei and her 
characters. This time, he did not kill Shaylei. I will not be as patient as she has been. This is blatant harrassment since he can not kill Shaylei or her alts, he is coming after me. If it continues, I will have no choice but to express my concerns to law enforcement. Please deal with this. Thank you.

Alceus has killed Zachariah twice. One time for defending Shaylei, another for attacking while defending Shaylei. Not only was it valid, it was within his own city. And, this statement will probably make me lose the issue, but I just have to say....OFFICER! HE'S KILLING MY CHARACTER IN A 
GAME!! ARREST THIS MAN!

This isn't so much as issue as it is more info on issues filed on Alceus by Shaylei and Zachariah. I would like to point out that at no point in time did I attempt contact with either of them. I've never talked to Zachariah and the only contact with Shaylei has been over a public OOC clan and was 
simply telling her how much of a bad person she is, which she pretty much proved by these issues.

Continued harrasment after an issue. Immediately after my issue was filed, I received the following tells from Alceus. Alceus tells you, "Law enforcement."  Alceus tells you,"You guys are just sad." 
Alceus tells you, "Officer! He's killing me in a game!"...I want this to stop. I wish to have nothing to do with Alceus or any of his other characters. I am asking you to stop it. As you will note, those tells were in an in character manner as he did not note that any of those were OOC.
