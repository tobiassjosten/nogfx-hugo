Velion tells you, "Stop being a douchebag and peppering DP with rites, then teaming whoever walks in."
You tell Velion, "Hey I came back to get Tek cause he didn't track with me and I walked in to you fighting, what do you expect me to do?"
Velion tells you, "That has nothing to do with anything. I attacked because of your rites. Now unenemy me."
You tell Velion, "Why, cause you demand it? I think not."
Velion tells you, "Becuase you have rites down in a damn hunting ground and I'll issue."
You tell Velion, "Issue all you like, they'll laugh at it and hit delete."
Velion tells you, "Grow the fuck up."
You tell Velion, "If you had said "could you please unenemy me your rites are hitting me" I would have."
You tell Velion, "I'm not the one being abusive here."
Velion tells you, "Unenemy me."
You tell Velion, "No you can wait it out now for your little tirade."
Velion tells you, "You're a fucking faggot, you know that?"
You tell Velion, "That's more like issue bait."
Velion tells you, "I try to bash a decent level for the torney, and I get hit by some douchebag who spread rites on DP. Go to hell."
