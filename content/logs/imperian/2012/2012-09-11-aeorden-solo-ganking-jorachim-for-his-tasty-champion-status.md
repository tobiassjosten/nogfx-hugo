kill aeo

Aeorden plunges his tail into your body, pumping you with Wyvern venom.
Blinding pain courses through your body as a sickening, bubbling venom attaches
 itself to the poison flowing in your blood and begins to harden. As your
 life-giving claret begins to crystallize and cut into your inner tissues, you
 feel your organs grow dangerously heavy and full. Before long, your first
 kidney bursts with a horrifying liquid POP. Your spleen and appendix soon
 follow. Your screams of agony are cut off abruptly as your lungs splatter
 themselves against the inside of your ribcage. As the combination of blood and
 fatal poison reaches your brain, your skull becomes curiously tight... A mere
 second passes before your head explodes in a mess of gore and bone.
You have been slain by Aeorden.
The corpse of a skeletal hound falls out of your inventory.
The corpse of a skeletal hound falls out of your inventory.
The corpse of a skeletal hound falls out of your inventory.
The corpse of a skeletal hound falls out of your inventory.
The corpse of a skeletal archer falls out of your inventory.
All your golden sovereigns fall out of your hands.
