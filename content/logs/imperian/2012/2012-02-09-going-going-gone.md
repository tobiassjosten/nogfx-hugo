Malkav, God of Madness and Insanity says, "The Noctusari received their knowledge from many sources. I of course played some role in Stavenn's early history, but I cannot claim full responsibility for their talents."
    
Your treant notifies you that Justus has entered the room.
    
You peer about yourself unscrupulously.
    
Squire Justus Thorondor says, "Ah, shit."
    
Atop the Tower of Madness.
This room has not been mapped.
The open terrace atop the tower seems to be as large as a city. Graceful statues, jagged metal sculptures, and strange artifacts are gathered to outline enchanting paths through the tropical grasses. The thick moisture from the clouds give the air a sweet taste and refreshing coolness, while the tower beneath your feet generates an energizing warmth. The surreal atmosphere epitomizes the infinite possibilities of Madness. A quicksilver throne with shimmering upholstery carefully molded for Malkav's derriere stands here. A disgustingly mutated treant lumbers about here, spewing clouds of spores into the air. Malkav is sitting on an ornate throne.
You see a single exit leading down.
    
Malkav peers at Justus unscrupulously.
    
Squire Justus Thorondor says, "Going going gone."
    
Justus twists his ring and fades from view.
Your treant notifies you that Justus has left the room.
