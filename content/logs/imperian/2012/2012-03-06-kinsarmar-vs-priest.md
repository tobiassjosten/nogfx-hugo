You call upon the Vagrant Lord and nod gravely at your Seraph, whose wings flare suddenly as an 
alien and frightening look of power sweeps across her face. With one hand, she reaches forward and 
as her hand touches Arakis's chest, it flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters his breast. 
The Seraph's eyes roll back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Arakis's body. Arakis 
collapses without a sound; his body now nothing more than a useless husk.
You have slain Arakis.

Animal trail through the Vardarian Highlands. (road). (lost) (Vardarian Highlands.?)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The free trees that dot the 
hills here whistle a bit in the breeze. There's little evidence of civilization, and the trail you 
are on was likely made by animals rather than sentient life. Small droppings litter the path, 
lending support to this idea. A full team of sturdy draft horses leads a huge caravan here. The 
decaying remains of Arakis lie here. A small orphine seed lies here. Its head poised in a prideful 
stance, a sleek black stallion stands here snorting arrogantly. A glowing angelic figure hovers in 
the air, iridescent crystal wreathing along her skin and wings. There are 9 corpses of a baby rat 
here. There are 2 corpses of an old rat here. There are 4 corpses of a young rat here. His spindly 
body broken, a goblin hunter's lifeblood spills out of his carcass here. Ser Orotu Bathory is riding
on an august burnished stallion. He wields a mithril sabre in his left hand and a cavalry shield in 
his right. Lady Naidia Peredhel is here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a curved 
sabre in her right.
You see exits leading north, west, and up.
