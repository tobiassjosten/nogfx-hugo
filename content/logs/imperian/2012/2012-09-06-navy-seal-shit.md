Surrounded by the low-lying mountains, Ithaqua was lost to the world of Aetherius for centuries until a band of exiled Khandavans came upon it. Accepted by the old war-hound, Fenrir Lyesmith, they rebuilt the ruined village upon the ideals of its people and ancient bloodlines.

Runelore - Totems

Syntax:
   CARVE TOTEM
   SKETCH <rune> ON <totem> ON SLOT <1-6>
   STAND TOTEM

Totems are a very powerful runelore skill. After you've carved a totem, you may sketch runes on one of 6 slots on a totem. You may then STAND TOTEM, to prop the totem up, and all enemies who enter the room will be affected by -each- rune on the totem, going from rune #1 to rune #6.

In order to carve a totem, you will require 20 wood commodities, 10 leather commodities, and 2 silver commodities.

In order to remove a rune from a totem, simply SMUDGE <totem> [SLOT 1-6] (the slot 1-6 is optional). You may also smudge runes on the ground, with SMUDGE GROUND. You may, however, only smudge runes that were sketched by someone with equal or lesser skill in Runelore.

Runes that you may sketch on totems:
Kena       Fehu
Pithakhan  Inguz
Wunjo      Sowulu
Mannaz     Sleizak
Nairat     Loshre

Kinsarmar Crossroads. (City of Kinsarmar.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. An unadorned bench of green marble sits here. Violet fire ripples over a tall obelisk of solid crystal, set into the very center of the crossroad. No bigger than a dwarf, a tiny marble fountain of a cherubim has been placed here. A slender depiction in silver has been placed here, a resplendent sculpture of the Lady of the Arcane. The shimmering glass lid of a large silver chest catches your eye, reminding you of the resplendent Night sky. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. There are 5 garlic wreaths here. Detailing a ritual enacted by the ancient people of Ik'taru's descent, this parchment has been scribed hastily, leaving many smudges and splotches of ink. It has been folded neatly, and appears to be fairly recently penned. A toadstool has been left here. A humongous tri-coloured dog gambols about clumsily, a line of drool dribbling from his mouth. There are 26 elite Mages of Kinsarmar here. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the room. A cerulean female bazwolf rests on her haunches nearby, ears perked. An elite Runeguard Knight is manning a cannon here. He has four cannon balls. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to the ground. A massive obsidian mammoth towers here, casting its hateful one-eyed gaze about its surroundings. A fiery Shaahri mare trots about. A frisky little squirrel monkey scampers nearby, playing with anything it can pick up. There are 6 elite Sidhe Skywatchers here. An elite Runeguard Knight stands here, twin runed blades at his sides. Calmly gazing upon her surroundings with ice blue eyes, a healthy white mare stands here upon strong legs. A small red squirrel with a bushy tail looks at you with big brown eyes. There are 2 ebon shires stallion here. A bushy tailed fox is sniffing around. The body of a young rat lies here. Genviere Chytovil is riding on a sturdy Dardanic mare.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Small flakes of white float through your field of vision here and there. The spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. The shop directory of Caanae rests here on a cracked marble pedestal. A well-carved statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A plain metal chest rests upon the ground here. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A massive, sparkling wheel hovers here, a bejeweled arrow pointing straight up from the middle of the wheel. A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A small sign points into a market stall. A pike with the decapitated head of Risca has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of Gurn has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of Galt has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of Aeorden has been erected. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. A sketch of a Runeguard floats in mid-air here. A songbird as white as snow maintains a constant hover here. A sketch of a Renegade floats in mid-air here. A sketch of a Bard floats in mid-air here. Pulsar Princess, Zcephonie Shaolar, Child of the Night Prophesy is here. She wields a hunter's spear in her left hand. Master Mathiaus Reopev is here. He wields a truesilver shield in his left hand and a Harp of the Harmonies in his right. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Ageranu, Aspect of Aryana.

Approximately five feet high, the runic totem is relatively smooth, and not particularly thick in diameter. The totem itself possesses little distinction, and shines only when a master of runelore has sketched runes upon it.
It is tuned against enemies of the Council of Khandava.
It is tuned for members of the Council of Khandava.
It weighs about 30 pounds.
It bears the distinctive mark of Blackthorn Dryad, Aleutia Sol'Anlumaire.

Approximately five feet high, the runic totem is relatively smooth, and not particularly thick in diameter. The totem itself possesses little distinction, and shines only when a master of runelore has sketched runes upon it.

Kinsarmar Crossroads. (City of Kinsarmar.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. An unadorned bench of green marble sits here. Violet fire ripples over a tall obelisk of solid crystal, set into the very center of the crossroad. No bigger than a dwarf, a tiny marble fountain of a cherubim has been placed here. A slender depiction in silver has been placed here, a resplendent sculpture of the Lady of the Arcane. The shimmering glass lid of a large silver chest catches your eye, reminding you of the resplendent Night sky. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. There are 5 garlic wreaths here. Detailing a ritual enacted by the ancient people of Ik'taru's descent, this parchment has been scribed hastily, leaving many smudges and splotches of ink. It has been folded neatly, and appears to be fairly recently penned. A toadstool has been left here. A humongous tri-coloured dog gambols about clumsily, a line of drool dribbling from his mouth. There are 26 elite Mages of Kinsarmar here. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the room. A cerulean female bazwolf rests on her haunches nearby, ears perked. An elite Runeguard Knight is manning a cannon here. He has four cannon balls. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to the ground. A massive obsidian mammoth towers here, casting its hateful one-eyed gaze about its surroundings. A fiery Shaahri mare trots about. A frisky little squirrel monkey scampers nearby, playing with anything it can pick up. There are 6 elite Sidhe Skywatchers here. An elite Runeguard Knight stands here, twin runed blades at his sides. Calmly gazing upon her surroundings with ice blue eyes, a healthy white mare stands here upon strong legs. A small red squirrel with a bushy tail looks at you with big brown eyes. There are 2 ebon shires stallion here. A bushy tailed fox is sniffing around. The body of a young rat lies here. An adorable calico kitten wanders here, chasing about imaginary bits of fluff. Genviere Chytovil is riding on a sturdy Dardanic mare. She wields a staff of the conjoined moons in her left hand and a lunar shield in her right. Lady Caelya Kaeul, Magister of Lore is here.

This oddly shaped bit of stone looks to be a fragment of tablet. The fragment is worn smooth in places, polished by time and the elements. Upon the surface of one side is an intricate etching of indeterminate origins. Within the grooves of the etching is a dark brown stain that gives the design more depth.
It weighs about 93 pounds.

Kinsarmar Crossroads. (City of Kinsarmar.)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. An unadorned bench of green marble sits here. Violet fire ripples over a tall obelisk of solid crystal, set into the very center of the crossroad. No bigger than a dwarf, a tiny marble fountain of a cherubim has been placed here. A slender depiction in silver has been placed here, a resplendent sculpture of the Lady of the Arcane. The shimmering glass lid of a large silver chest catches your eye, reminding you of the resplendent Night sky. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. There are 5 garlic wreaths here. Detailing a ritual enacted by the ancient people of Ik'taru's descent, this parchment has been scribed hastily, leaving many smudges and splotches of ink. It has been folded neatly, and appears to be fairly recently penned. A toadstool has been left here. A humongous tri-coloured dog gambols about clumsily, a line of drool dribbling from his mouth. There are 26 elite Mages of Kinsarmar here. A small, snow-white fox slinks about the room. A cerulean female bazwolf rests on her haunches nearby, ears perked. An elite Runeguard Knight is manning a cannon here. He has four cannon balls. Surrounded by the scent of lilies, a tranquil mare of pure white gently rests here, her silken ribbons trailing to the ground. A massive obsidian mammoth towers here, casting its hateful one-eyed gaze about its surroundings. A fiery Shaahri mare trots about.
