ITHAQUA NEWS #1221
Date: 12/20/2012 at 19:35
From: Sir Bathan Zran, the Oathsmith
To  : Everyone
Subj: ---

I recall arriving in Ithaqua some years ago.

A land that had prided itself on strength had become strangely weak. Ithaqua's 
coffers were amongst the most barren in the land. Ithaqua's economy had fallen 
to ruin. Materials were not being processed, caravans were not being run. On 
the battlefield, Ithaqua was nothing more than a joke. The Desert Protectorate 
shouldered the load against our enemies, while Ithaqua sat back, content to do 
nothing but focus on the affairs of the clans, and our shops and pursuit of 
crafts.

That was an Ithaqua that was weak and stood little chance of surviving the 
storm that would soon follow. It excelled in a couple of areas, but it did not 
have balance. Some believed that ignoring the world would bear no consequences,
and so, when the Demons came, those who would fight stood at the gates, leading
our troops against an army that had come to wipe out Divinities and mortals 
alike. We stood though. We borrowed from the desert, we borrowed from the 
Duchy. We even borrowed from the Empire. We did what we had to in order to 
survive because if we had not, our home would be no more. Those were shameful 
times. Out of that weakness though came great men and women who have continued 
to grow and safeguard the pines.

At present, our forces in the land are spoken of with fear. Magick abhors the 
sound of the earth shaking, the herald of our forces. They cry out openly when 
we appear knowing that even with less numbers at times, our strength is still 
too much for them. It is not because we are faster, or because we are stronger,
but because of our conviction. It is because we understand the value of working
together as a tribe, sharing our burdens and our triumphs, valuing the services
of all who call Ithaqua home. We act as adults, and not children.

It is not just on the field, though. We create great works of wood and metal 
and sell them to the populace. We possess great merchants, makers of all manner
of finery. We possess individuals of great ambition who seek to forge paths for
all in the land to follow. We possess people willing to work to continue making
our Council strong, in whatever manner they are able to. Our Council does not 
look down on any for their contributions. No true Ithaquan glorifies themselves
or their ideal through putting others down to do it. Ithaqua is strong. We are 
above such things.

I have removed Seneca after being told once more that the Wardens are 
worthless, and contributing to the 'ruin' of the Pines. It was another childish
stint of walking out, mid conversation after being told she would be glad if 
the Wardens burned. Another instance of ignoring the worlds of her fellow 
Ithaquans. Seneca has brought service to the Pines in her diligence through 
trade, but it does not excuse her continued disrespectful behavior. The 
Wildgraf warned that she was out of chances, and having once more shown her 
quality, I have removed her. She is, of course, welcome to wander as a guest, 
but is no longer a member of our tribe. I will of course take whatever 
consequences come to me, but this decision was made because I honor Ithaqua and
what it stands for. I will see her shamed no longer at the hands of an 
infantile, childish woman who cannot even lift her blade to defend her own 
life.

In her absence, I will run her share of the caravans and ensure that trade 
remains prosperous until another is appointed who is able to handle the 
responsibility without using the position as a dagger against the Council's 
throat.
