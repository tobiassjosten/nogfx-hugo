Subject: You've been on my mind......

Dear Vashir,

Please don't read this in a hurry. I express myself in the written word a
lot better than I do verbally, it must be something to do with me being a
writer. But sometimes I wonder if you see me at all. Actually, it's a
wonder you don't, I'm often there peering through the trees,
and sometimes it seems you're staring right at me. But you never
acknowledge me... you just turn away, blurting "Hey" before turning your
mind to some imaginary task. What task could be any greater than developing
our deep friendship into something more?

You have the most brilliant of smiles -- it's like the skies themselves
open up and start raining showers of sunshine. Sometimes when you work late
into the night and start dozing off, your eyes blank and drool dripping
from the corners of your mouth, I feel like I can see who you truly are --
a hardworking Divine that doesn't afraid of anyone. And why should you? You
have a vorpal sword in hand. Maybe that vorpal sword is enough for you, but
I'm guessing it isn't. Even Divine have needs.

Here is a small list of things that I think you should think about. They're
reasons why I think you should drop everything and declare your undying
love for me -- because I think you know these intense feelings between us
need to be addressed and followed-up on.

1. We both love the mythical creature the Jabberwock. I mean, you have the
freaking vorpal sword! And I can understand why you love it so much...
sometimes when I dress up as the Jabberwock alone, I wish you were there
with your vorpal sword, going snicker-snack. And when the Jabberwock's been
properly beheaded, I could be your father, crying "Callough, Calleigh! Come
to my arms, my beamish boy." Mrowwwl.
2. We are both insanely positive and energetic.
3. We both are educated individuals.
4. We both have the same number of letters in our name, and they intersect
at that "h". We have really similar names in that regard, and Kabbalic
writings and numerology suggest we are totally compatible.
5. We both think that NBC should sign a contract for Community for 6
seasons and a movie.
6. And most importantly, we share the same theology regarding religion,
other Divine, etc.

The makings for something solid are undeniable on my end whether as friends
or not. We have only really been able to chat a few times, and that was
enough for me to see that we have so many similar interests that we would
be perfect together. PLUS, you were born in the month of Halitus, and my
best friends were born in Halitus, which is kinda weird because astrology
suggests we'd be terrible together.

I think you're the most amazing Divine I have ever met. A Divine I believe
is even more awesome for his charisma and attitude versus looks alone. BUT
YOU HAVE IT ALL !! YOU HAVE IT ALL !! And I know it's not like I'm obsessed
with you or anything. Honestly, I think about you constantly, and it makes
me weak in the knees.

Interesting questions, interesting perspectives. Now... the question is
"what will you do with it?" For that matter, you probably haven't read up
til now. I promise if we get together, though, you'll certainly say that I
bring the best out of you. Will you ask yourself these questions? Will you
find out that what you're feeling is actually the same undying love I have
for you? Will you decide that I'm an important person and that this
situation we face is worth the effort of solving? Or will you just be
irritated that I addressed these feelings so soon? But we can still talk
about it as friends... we can be good friends until you decide you want to
take that extra step elsewhere.

That said, I now offer you something totally crazy -- and I mean crazy,
crazy. I'm an artist, you tell me, and I have crazy ideas. What if we take
a weekend off to go visit Matt or something in Hawaii? I was thinking
sometime before Valentine's Day. A weekend to start over from zero, to see
where it all goes. We could go to Tahiti, or maybe go to San Francisco and
do some wine tasting?

Yes, this is a crazy idea, I'm crazy when it comes down to you, but so are
you. See, we're not different at all!!!

How everything looks easy, simple, and full of hope... when looked at from
the middle of the night, when everyone sleeps, when tomorrow is full of
surprises but the night is...full of dreams.
