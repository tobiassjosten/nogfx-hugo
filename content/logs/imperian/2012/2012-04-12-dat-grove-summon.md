The grasslands seems to move about you menacingly as the land appears to close 
in on you.
You start unearthing a partially buried blue shard, careful not to break its 
delicate structure. A swirling aura of raw Diachaim slowly forms around you.
You have recovered balance.
You are lifted suddenly off your feet and into the air by an unseen force. The 
ground blurs about you for a moment, then suddenly you plummet unceremoniously 
to the earth again at Ziat\\'s feet. (grovesummon)
Wide dusty plain adjoining Savannah. (Heartlands.?)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A large beehive hangs down from the 
trees above. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the southeast. An icewall 
is here, blocking passage to the west. A giant black fire ant scavenges about 
the area. A mighty earth golem stands guard here. A swarm of bees hovers 
menacingly nearby. A massive groomed black stallion stands here proudly, its 
large form covered in silver battle armour. An enormous, ancient frost grizzly 
looms over his surroundings here, his hoary fur ragged with old scars. An 
incorporeal shadow is hovering here. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating 
from Ziat, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a sharpened quarterstaff in his hands. A
peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Sumie, Aspect of Aryana. She 
wields a sharpened quarterstaff in her hands. A peaceful aura fills the area, 
emanating from Galt, Aspect of Aryana. He wields a massive elemental war-staff 
in his left hand and a truesilver shield in his right. Several large white oak 
trees form a peaceful grove. 
You see exits leading southeast and west.
Your concentration ruined, you stop unearthing the shard.
