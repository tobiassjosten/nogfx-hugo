The Celidon Threshold. [Celidon Council.][13499]
A rune that looks like a nail has been sketched into the ground here. Sparkling as they catch stray light, pieces of various coloured gemstones dangle from the dowels of a forest green hammock hanging here. A massive, sparkling wheel hovers here, a bejeweled arrow pointing straight up from the middle of the wheel. Lined with silken fabric of a silvery-blue hue, a simple basket sits in the corner. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A pool of shadows swirls about the centre of the room releasing tendrils of darkness about the ground. A noble black horse prances here, with eyes of silvery starlight. A large cave bat hangs menacingly above you, watching your every move. There are 2 fruit bats here. There are 20 elite Xiur Champions of Celidon here. There are 2 immense shadow arachnids here. There are 2 elite moss-covered xiur brawlers here. A centaur earth priestess drags her hand along the rocks here, motes of light dancing at her fingertips. Caelas Willowbrook stands here alert, scanning the area for signs of trouble. A huge elephant swings its trunk back and forth here. A banded stallion stands here quietly regarding his surroundings. A spectral panther named Aviros is here, prowling within the shadows. An august burnished stallion stands here, stomping his hooves. Nostrils flared, a black and white mare stands attentively here. A graceful silver mare prances here, tossing her flower-wreathed head. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, keen eyes gazing upon you. Candide, Student of the Arts is here.
