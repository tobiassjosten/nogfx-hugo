Issue #103211   Reported by: Jannette    Re: Menoch

Killing a non-com for no valid IG reason. 'Having a loud mouth' is not a valid reason for killing a NON-Combatant, as was stated. There was no aggressive actions or words spoken against these people. I read somewhere that Killing a non-com is now against rules. Follow those rules.

Killing for roleplay reasons is permitted, and the only acceptable reason for any killing in Imperian. In practice, this means that if someone is insulting you repeatedly or attacking a member of your city, you have a good reason to be attacking them. <-- Those are both taken from HELP PK. It is not ever against the rules to lay the hammer down on someone who wants to spew taunts and vitriol.

The soul of Druidess of War, Shaylei Eldunari, Dreamstalker says, "Pussies." After three language issues from her, I'm really thinking this is ridiculous. Can we get some fairness?

Pussies, Is not a swear word nor a derogatory word, where Whore, slut are. Also this was put after Menoch and company attacked and Killed Shaylei at a drop point right she left Dis, which is against the rules stated in HELP PK. Fairness is a fickle thing, I have never called Menoch names like Bastard, Son Of a Bitch all of which are swear and cursory words and phases Yet multiple times he has referred to Shaylei in such manners as a woman of ill repute and so forth. Thank you for time, and sorry for the waste of energy this has caused.

I joined a teamffa, Menoch and Eveline proceeded to kill me. Hence stopping me from partaking in the event. I rejoined, and they proceeded to kill me again. Hindering any chances that I may have had to win the event.

What is this I don't even... no. Just no. Learn the rules of the game you are playing before you issue people for breaking ones that don't exist.


And to be fair, Jannette was mocking me for about 20 mins in tells prior to her being vivi'd in the Silver Harp on our little adventure. Also, Shaylei is mistaken (about everything(jesus her grammar omfg stop my eyes)), as our entire team tried to kill her simultaneously and without premeditation. I guess she just has that effect on people.
