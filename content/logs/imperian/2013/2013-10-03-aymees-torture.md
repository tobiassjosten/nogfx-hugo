Torture Chambers.
A ladder rack stands against the wall here. A thin parchment scroll has been tacked to a far wall. A 
long iron rod with an unusual symbol on the end lies here. A garrotte device sits quietly awaiting 
its next victim. An Iron Maiden stands here with its door slightly ajar. A strange chair covered in 
holes sits here. An obsidian halberd at the ready, an executioner stands here, his eyes gleaming 
with an eerie greed. Lady Elizabell yn'Chionnal, Mourning in Madness is here. She is holding an 
ornately wrought tablet in her right hand. The undead form of Disciplinarian Raykel Uchiha, Imperial 
Infiltrator is here. He wields a claymore in his hands.
You see a single exit leading north.
Ansol, the Imperial Executioner looks up briefly before turning to check that all the equipment is 
in working order.

back the instinct to retch as Raykel suddenly leaps to his feet with a mortal heart in his hands.

Gathering his precious essence, Raykel closes his eyes and concentrates. His mortal frame begins to 
shake as he slowly drains the smallest portion of his own life into Aymee. Aymee screams in rage as 
the soul enters the body.
Aymee rises from the ground in undeath.
