Issue #103021   Reported by: Shaylei    Re: Velion
2013-04-04 08:23:41: 
improper use of snub. He insulted Shaylei and promptly snubbed her. If you are going to insult someone, and hide behind snub for fear of their powerful words, then maybe you oughta not insult them in the first place eh?

1. People who send a tell and then SNUB are losers.

2. Doing so is not abusing the SNUB command.

3. If someone is doing this to you, SNUB them if you can't deal with it.

4. Do not issue when someone does this. SNUB them or get a thicker skin.
