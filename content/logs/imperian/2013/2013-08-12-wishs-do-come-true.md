Kinsarmar Crossroads.
A rune like a closed eye has been sketched into the ground here. A sewer grate 
looms darkly beneath your feet. An unadorned bench of green marble sits here. 
Violet fire ripples over a tall obelisk of solid crystal, set into the very 
center of the crossroad. A few small pieces spilling out, a bag of bread crumbs 
lies here. No bigger than a dwarf, a tiny marble fountain of a cherubim has been
placed here. A slender depiction in silver has been placed here, a resplendent 
sculpture of the Lady of the Arcane. There are 10 monolith sigils here. A 
truesilver pike with the decapitated head of Brishi has been erected by Lionas. 
A pike with the decapitated head of Mathiaus has been erected. The shimmering 
glass lid of a large silver chest catches your eye, reminding you of the 
resplendent Night sky. Sparkling on the ground lays a small silver tinderbox. A 
pike with the shrunken head of Brishi has been erected. A pike with the 
decapitated head of Dyrren has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of
Linslet has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of Iluv has been 
erected. A truesilver pike with the decapitated head of Brishi has been erected 
by Iluv. Growling and hissing, this grotesque creation wanders back and forth, 
its long tail wrapped around its apelike body which attempts to balance its 
wolfish muzzle. Its long, smooth tail curled around its legs, an exotic canine 
sits here peacefully. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse 
stands here imperially. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. 
Occasionally pouncing on imaginary foes, a fluffy strawberry-hued silril kitten 
plays here. Muscles rippling beneath its ebon coat, a massive shire stands here 
poised and alert. A vicious smoke-blue stallion stands here, pawing and stomping
ferociously at the ground. An elite Warrior of Kinsarmar is manning a cannon 
here. He has one-hundred and fifty-one cannon balls. A surly blue bear lumbers 
around the area, growling vehemently. A massive groomed black stallion stands 
here proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. Its head poised in
a prideful stance, a sleek black stallion stands here snorting arrogantly. 
Stamping his golden hooves and tossing his crimson mane, this blooded warhorse 
stands here bearing a regal strength. There are 12 elite Mages of Kinsarmar 
here. Defiant in stance, a muscular white stallion stares attentively at the 
surroundings with piercing eyes of ice blue. A noble kestrel is perched nearby, 
keen eyes gazing upon you. There are 31 elite Runeguard Knights here. An 
animated birch root is curled here, swaying slightly. An animated hawthorn root 
is curled here, swaying slightly. A mighty earth golem stands guard here. 
Baasche is here, camouflaged. He wields a long, sharp dagger in his left hand 
and a banded shield in his right. General Brishi Dra'Nyk is riding on a massive 
warhorse. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand. Tristam is here. He 
wields a claymore in his hands. Unfinished trenches have been dug at this 
location, with wires lying all around. 
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.
