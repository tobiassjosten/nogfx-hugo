--- Volcanic foothills ------------ 2:2:0 ---
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant clouds. Rolling sand dunes gradually ascend into 
jagged volcanic foothills high above the water's edge, which line the vast ocean that seemingly disappears towards the western 
horizon. Rough terrain allows only the hardiest of plant life to flourish amongst crevices and broken cliff face that dot this 
portion of the volcanic region. An occasional spray of saltwater gently blows across the cliffs, providing a unique source of 
nourishment for tufts of tenaciously clinging vines and weeds that protrude from the rocks. A steep embankment continues upwards 
towards the peak of an ancient-looking volcano. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A black ouroboros 
oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes. A large hound clad in blackened plate armour stands at the ready. 
A lithe ebonmarrow stands here watching you warily. The undead form of Centurion Ihsan Nessaja, Son of War is here. He wields a 
buckler in his left hand and a wicked-looking daegger in his right. The undead form of Lord Menoch Blackfyre is here. He wields 
a curved sabre in his left hand. Ulynt Ashtear is here. Lord Commander Iniar Nullheart, Anti-Hero is here.
You see exits leading west and up.
