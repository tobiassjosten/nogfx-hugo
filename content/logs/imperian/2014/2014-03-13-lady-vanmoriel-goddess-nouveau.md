2014/03/13 04:50:00 - Aros inguilded Akromah.
2014/03/13 04:50:52 - Aros promoted Orwell out of guild novicehood.
2014/03/13 04:52:33 - Aros > with everything going on Akromah came to me to ask to join the Crusaders who I hope will make a fine addition. Given there is nothing in the Plog about Akromah I took a chance to hopefully gain another valued member.
2014/03/13 05:45:08 - Kryss outguilded Akromah.
2014/03/13 05:54:12 - Kryss > No one is to be inguilded or promoted without word from Lady Vanmoriel.

permission of the Lady Vanmoriel, blessed be her 

name."


You recall that (2014/03/13 05:41) Kryss said:

You recall that (2014/03/13 05:41) Lylian said:
"So our novices can not become full members of our 

guild?"

You recall that (2014/03/13 05:43) Lylian said:
"I do not believe I have read anywhere that our 

novices are unable to take their tests or others 

could join the guild. I do not see why we can not go 

on about business. I do not see why we must punish 

our young ones because of things that do not involve 

them. Allow them to stand and make their own 

choices."

"Mark these words. NO ONE is to be inguilded or 

promoted."


You recall that (2014/03/13 05:47) Kryss said:
"Anyone found in contempt of such will be dismissed 

and brought down by my hand."


You recall that (2014/03/13 05:47) Kryss said:
"We MUST stand VIGILANT against the DARKNESS."

"Defying the Lady Vanmoriel, all glory to her 

person, is defying all that is good and pure."
