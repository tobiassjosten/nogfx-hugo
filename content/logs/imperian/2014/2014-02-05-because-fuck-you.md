<<Idras>>: Airamaya says, "You think if I wanted to oust you I would not have done it from the get go? Quit your self pitying, everyone hates me, -tantrums-. I have never wanted to oust you. I did not want to see anything but for you succeed. You cannot control yourself and lead yourself down this path. Do not blame every single person because something did not go your way."

<<Idras>>: Airamaya says, "And this, right here Aiushta, is why you failed as Feyn. You assume you know everything and you do not. You know nothing."

<<Idras>>: You say, "And if you actually believe that I am angry at this point, then stop flattering yourself for a moment. I am much calmer than you are at this point."

<<Idras>>: Airamaya says, "There you go, assuming things about others that you have no knowledge of."

<<Idras>>: You say, "I have the courage to push things forward, the will to stand against the tides of hatred and the mind to design a thousand plans and paths for this organization. You simply have the mind to follow preset plans, your courage only takes you as far as people approve of your plans, you will always be someone's doll, even as a Wildgraf. And your will? Your will is so weak that you will change with the tides, bathing in that hatred and turning your weapons against your principles."

<<Idras>>: You say, "That is where you, Airamaya, fail as a leader and Ithaquan."

<<Idras>>: You say, "You are a weakling and a coward."

<<Idras>>: You say, "When you shall step out of your comfort zone, I will have an ounce of respect towards you. Until then, you may continue acting as if you are Ithaquan and as if you are in charge but we both know that you are a slave for support. You, Airamaya, are a failure."

<<Idras>>: You say, "And what actually saddens me is that you do not have the eyes to see it and the heart to overcome this whoring for support."

<<Idras>>: You say, "I may be replaced soon and you may think of yourself as a true Idrasi however, you are nowhere near. My loyal companion has more loyalty and heart than you do. You are a dull, weak carcass who occupies a leadership role within Ithaqua for the moment. Nothing you do will matter, nothing you plan will change anything because you are weak."
