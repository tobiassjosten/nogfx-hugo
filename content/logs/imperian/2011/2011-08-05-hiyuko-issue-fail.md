Unfortunately I'll have to be the one to apologies for Hiyuko wasting your time Clotho, and other administration.  I would like to first take into account HELP RULES and the listing of what said rules are.  There are no direct stated rules that list metagaming as against the rules.  It's in bad taste and most choose to follow through and refuse to do it however it's not a punishable offense.  Second account he is assuming I am Sameth and not a Shamanism user with my character with the power of DUST THROW DIVINE that allows me to see who all is in a room with someone else.  This also is a failed part of his lack of proper judgement he used before taking this to the issue power.  I hardly how I see the need to be punished when nothing stated as bliant rule breaks has been done.  There was no IN CHARACTER resolution attempted from my character attempting to goad Hiyuko and Avaeo into a since of good verses bad roleplay other than him assuming I am also Sameth, (Which I am not) and taking it straight to issue without asking me the player to cease ( as i would have should he asked) instead he made fail claims, and threats to issue.  Once again I apologize for his lack of foresight and bringing this into your already busy hands.  Good day.
