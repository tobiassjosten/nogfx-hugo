Message #1133	Sent By: Dranor
"You hate Imperian. I get it, I really do. You've made your feelings abundantly clear. So just go away. Don't ruin the game for other people by trying to destroy their organizations. I'm going to go out on a limb and appeal to whatever's left of your sense of decency and ask that you give the gold and comms back to Khandava, and then just quit."

"Yeah, you're really going to have to make an effort to make amends for your actions. I'm sure you can understand why I can't let one person (who constantly complains about how much he hates the game) ruin the game for an entire group of people. Yeah, you're selfish. And quite frankly, I don't believe you about your motives. You can't say the things that you've been saying for so long, suddenly show up after being gone for so long, attempt to ruin an organization and then try to claim that you weren't doing it to screw the game or the group of players that you're trying to punish."

"The difference in this situation is that you were actively trying to ruin the organization as you were leaving it, like trying to dismantle all of the outposts. That's why I'm stepping in to this situation, as I had to step in to the Wytchen situation when somebody tried to ruin that guild a while back. Although it's pretty lame, theft is fine. Deliberately trying to destroy an organization is not acceptable, and that's why I'm stepping in. I don't know if the amounts that you're stating are acceptable, as I haven't added up everything that you've taken. You basically have an opportunity to make things right and to prove to me that you weren't trying to damage the game. It's up to you how far you want to take it."

"Yeah, if you'd done a lot worse, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Like I said, I'm giving you a chance. The ball's in your court."

"Are you going to be able to fix the rest of the damage that you did to Khandava in an attempt to deliberately ruin that city?"

You sent the following message to Dranor: I wasn't under the impression I needed to return everything, as you said yourself theft was legal, and that was what I did.

You sent the following message to Dranor: I returned a significant amount of gold and commodities. I can try to find an exact breakdown, though I don't remember it and I just deleted the log of it.

msg Dranor 12.5 million gold, and I think somewhere around 2k of non-food commodities. Food was closer to 15k returned, it's the major one that has an effect outside of crafting.

"I'm sorry if I gave you that mistaken impression. The point that I'm trying to make is that what you did wasn't org theft. Theft would be legal. You were deliberately trying to ruin an organization, and that's what I'm not going to tolerate. You have to fix it, and simply returning a small fraction of the damage that you did isn't going to be sufficient."

You sent the following message to Dranor: You said verbatim 'theft is fine', albeit lame. I did not do anything other than theft. I did not kick anyone out of the city, destroy anything, etc. No other thieves have been singled out. Nothing I did left any permanent damage at all now that 20% of the gold and a portion of the comms are returned. Returning everything would be literally impossible at this point as I've spent a large section of it. I don't particularly find it fair that I'm being typecast like I destroyed every clan and house and shop and everything that personally affected people. I didn't, and you said yourself what you would have done if I had.

"Alright. Your actions were deliberately destructive to Imperian as a whole. You don't get to decide to try and kill organizations that you don't like, abusing the mechanics granted to you as the city leader. I've tried to give you an opportunity to fix it, and you've refused. Therefore, I'm going to shrub all of your characters, ban you from Imperian, and ban you from the forums. I wish it didn't have to come to this, but I know that removing your toxic presence is the best decision for Imperian, for the rest of Imperian's players, and for Imperian's Administration."
