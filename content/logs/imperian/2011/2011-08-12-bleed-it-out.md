Inside a market stall.
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An 
icewall is here, blocking passage to the out. A young Sidhe boy meanders about 
thoughtfully. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, flexing its long wiry 
antennae. The terrible demonic form of Warlord Juganothion Gazali towers over 
you, filling you with fear. He wields a mithril shield in his left hand and a 
jar of maggots in his right. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is 
the command to see what is for sale. 
You see exits leading down (closed door) and out.
