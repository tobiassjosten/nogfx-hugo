You preen happily.

Mista says, "Why are you wearing clothes naughty girl?"

You give a wolfish grin, displaying your fangs.

You say, in Lycaean, "I don't know what you're talking about."

You remove sumptuous black suede lace-up pants.

You remove a gypsy blouse of soft white cotton.

You remove polished ebony ankle boots.

You remove a suit of leather armour.

You remove an Outrider's cloak.

You give a wolfish grin, displaying your fangs.

You remove a durable black leather backpack.

You fiddle absentmindedly with your hair.
Your pose is now: fiddling absentmindedly with her hair.

Mista says, "I dont understand when you speak like that."

You say, in Lycaean, "Idiots."

You shall now speak in Common.

You say, "I said, "I don't know what you're talking about.""

You give a wolfish grin, displaying your fangs.

Mista says, "Oh really?"

You nod slowly.

You smile at Mista with satisfaction, preening happily.

Mista says, "I believe we should start where we left off."

You give a wolfish grin, displaying your fangs.

You fiddle absentmindedly with your hair.
Your pose is now: fiddling absentmindedly with her hair.

Mista slowly begins to stroke the top of her cunt. her fingers gazing over her 
pussy lips as a gainst 16 inch cock suddenly springs forward. her cock heavy 
and large as it leaks of hot cum upon your feet. As she sits upon the sand her 
cock remains erect "I want you to ride me now, little wolfy."

You have emoted: Emiliana lowers herself onto you, facing you as she guides 
herself down onto your member. She lets out a feminine "Hee!" as she does so, 
her arousal as apparent as her shyness. She begins to grind up against you 
sensually, her bright pink insides showing as your length slowly slides into 
her.

You say, "Tell seraphita (( Lol, Mista is so desperate, it's hilarious. Why the
fuck am I doing this? It's hardly worth the logs, he's so terrible. ))"

"Oops!" you exclaim with a bashful expression.

You tell Mista, "And... cut!"

Mista tells you, "(( :( I'm terriable am I?))"

Mista tells you, "I dont care."

Mista shrugs helplessly at you.

Mista says, "Be."

((Putting clothes back on. ))

Mista says, "Bye."

Mista tells you, "((By the way, lots of people enjoy me and Im not desperate))"
