A junction of Wendigo catwalk.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. This has been marked as holy ground. The Fountain of Aryana has been placed here, sparkling blue water cascading down the sides. A plain wood chest is here. There are a group of 1412 charcoal cinders here. You have entered the campground of Alarick. A browned hide lies on the ground here. His muzzle grey and hoary with age, an elder of the village crouches here casting bones. Bundled in fur and leather, an Ithaquan village woman stands here silently. There are 2 Ithaquan villagers here. An elite Warden lancer is manning a cannon here. He has fifty-one cannon balls. His amber eyes gazing serenely about him, a large cream colored Graytrem draft stallion stands here in a regal manner. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. A dolorous baby elephant mopes around here, her little trunk snuffling the ground. There are 9 elite Idrasi wolfriders here. Mounted on an Ithaquan arctic wolf, an Idrasi wolfrider scans the area with a cold stare. A lithe yellow jaguar with black spots prowls the area. There are 5 elite Warden lancers here. A spirited Shaahri stallion trots about. A tengu hovers gently over the ground here. A fearsome lion prowls around here and greets you with a warning roar. The shining figure of a Seraphic guardian floats in the air here. Jaw hanging open in a snarl, a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Lemuela Valstivar is here. Leisane Valstivar is riding on a banded tiger stallion. He wields a mithril shield in his left hand and a truesilver mace in his right. Lord Azyel Saa'Zios Icewyrm of the North is riding on a massive warhorse. He wields a curved sabre in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. Wiliam is here, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. A cloud of smoke fills the area, coming from a campfire in the center of a campground. 
You see exits leading north, east, south, and west.

A great weight seems to have been lifted from Leisane.
Leisane rubs some salve on his skin.

Lemuela Valstivar says, "We don't use the word simpleton here."

You say, "Shimpleton."

You utter a deep, rumbling laugh.

You have emoted: Eugene gives a totally blank stare for several seconds, he 
puts his finger into his mouth briefly, covering his fingertip with saliva.

You have recovered balance.

You have emoted: Eugene gives Lemuela a eager look, scrunching up his face, 
reaching over with his wet finger and placing it directly into Lemuela's ear. 
He lingers for a second and then withdraws it, his face returning to normal as 
if nothing had happened.

You have recovered balance.

Emeren arrives from the north.

Lemuela sticks her tongue out and says 'Ack.'

Emeren nods his head in greeting.

Wiliam says to Lemuela, "I believe your parentsh worked for my father."

You say, "Yesh."

Emeren raises an eyebrow questioningly.

Lemuela blinks.

A lean grey wolf pads out to the north, yellow eyes glinting.

Wiliam says to you, "Yesh indeed, shir."

Lemuela Valstivar says to Wiliam, "My parents worked for no one in the Empire. 
You are mistaken."

You say, "That ish sheemigly mosht correct."

You nod your acknowledgement of Emeren.

Leisane Valstivar says, "Now then, since we are not getting very far. You are 
given two choices. You may answer questions directed at you, or, if you choose 
to assault any other citizens without provocation, you will be removed. 
Forcibly."

Head held low and alert, a savage grey wolf pads in from the north.

You say, "Yesh that is ridiculoush. They should be honoured by our preshenshe."
 
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh at Leisane.
 
Head held low and alert, a savage grey wolf pads in from the north.

Wiliam says to Leisane, "How rude. You should shtroke my chin and rub my feet."
 
You nod your head at Wiliam, showing your acceptance.
 
Lemuela Valstivar says, "Do you boys need any help? Otherwise please leave the 
Council now."
 
You say, "My houshe is worth more than your life, and you threaten oursh."
 
A masked man's eyes sparkle with amusement.
 
You utter a deep, rumbling laugh.
 
Wiliam stares at Leisane intently as he approaches him, sucking his thumb 
absently minded. Wiliam stops for a moment, watching Leisane closely as he 
withdraws his thumb from his mouth and wipes it on Leisane's arm.
 
Leisane Valstivar smiles impishly and says, "Then it is decided then."
 
Wiliam steps on Leisane's feet and he cups his chin, stroking his own with his 
free hand. "Well formed chin, shir." Wiliam comments right before he places a 
quick kiss upon the tip of Leisane's nose and steps back, returning to normal 
as if nothing had happened.

A masked man says something unintelligible in a series of complex clicks and 
rattles.
 
You say, "Shimpletonsh, perhapsh we should move on."
 
Wiliam nods his head.
 
Wiliam disappears in a flash of light, teleporting by the power of the Gods.
 
You say, "They cannot comprehend our wealth."
 
Realizing that you have absolutely no clue where you are, you call on the power
of the Gods to rescue you.
An arch-filled clearing.
A small wooden sign floats here, displaying numerous directions. A heavy iron 
chest sits here. A simple hammock hangs here, inviting in its comfortable 
appeal. A plain wooden sign is here, with a yellow parchment hanging on it. A 
glass sphere rolls around here, pushed to and fro by a small brown hamster 
contained within. A small brown puffball bares her teeth in a wide, crooked 
grin as she begs for scraps here. Wiliam is here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, 
west, northwest, and down.
