Snuffling along the ground carefully, a gloomy sable kitten slowly slinks away from Santhaea's side, leaping carefully atop a table, tiny paws haphazardly navigating the myriad of bottles and glassware there.

You blink.

You say, "Careful there, kitten."

You pet a gloomy sable kitten ingratiatingly.

Luodo Andarial says, "Your kitten is quite lively."

You say, "Troublemaker."

Luodo chuckles long and heartily.

You say, "I haven't named him, but I should call him that."

You smile wryly, quite clearly amused.
  
Tail waving slowly in the air as he explores, a serious expression on his gloomy face, a gloomy sable kitten arches delicately against Santhaea's hand before he wobbles dangerously as he glances back to her, instead changing tactics and rubbing warmly against a sizable glass bottle.

You have emoted: Santhaea steadys the bottle that the kitten rubs against with a finger and trails her other hand across the kitten's soft ears with affection.

You say to a gloomy sable kitten, "You almost made that look smooth."

You give a mischievous grin.

Luodo peers at a gloomy sable kitten unscrupulously.

Granting a soft, strangled sort of mewl in an almost firm reply, a gloomy sable kitten sits back to swat at Santhaea's hand playfully before pausing just so, sitting upright on his haunches with his front paws against her hand as his attention settles firmly on a tiny songbird.

"Heh heh heh," Luodo chuckles.

You have emoted: Santhaea tickles the kitten's chin with her finger, following the intent gaze of the kitten's eyes.

You say, "Oh, no, little one. Not for you."

Tufted ears quirking attentively, a gloomy sable kitten pushes off of Santhaea's hand and stumbles back a little less gracefully than he may have desired though his intense expression never wavers as he wiggles slightly, crouching stealthily behind one of the glass containers.

You have emoted: Santhaea moves a couple bottles from before the kitten, so that in his leap he doesn't take them out as well. She murmurs softly, "You're going to fall, little one..."

Luodo chuckles long and heartily.

You say to a tiny songbird of shimmering color, "Colibri.. you might want to be aware..."

Seemingly unaware of the potential, a tiny songbird of shimmering color settles delicately atop a beaker to trill musically before carefully attending its prismatic feathers, preening contently and pausing to trill sporadically throughout the process.

Santhaea snickers softly, watching the two intently with a completely amused look on her face.

Luodo Andarial says to you, "You and your pets Love."


You flash Luodo a joyous smile.

You say, "I love my animals.."

Luodo grins mischievously.

Luodo Andarial says to you, "It shows Sweetheart."

You smile softly.

Crouching low with his tiny tail waving dramatically slow, a gloomy sable kitten creeps a single pace forward after casting a suspicious glance towards Santhaea, as though she may have revealed him and in response, he crouches a little lower to the table.

Luodo Andarial says to you, "Heh...the "jungle cat" stalks his prey."

Santhaea covers her mouth with a hand, hiding her smile and covers her laughter with a soft cough. She says to Luodo, nearly whispering, "Shh.. don't distract the kitten.."

Pausing, a tiny songbird of shimmering color looks towards Luodo at the sound of his voice before its tiny features light up a little in looking at Santhaea, releasing a long, pleasant trill of warbling, high musical notes before beginning again upon the preening process.

Santhaea reaches over and strokes the head of her songbird, showing gentle affection as she grins, still watching the kitten.


Wriggling a final time, a gloomy sable kitten seems intent on trying to drag itself lowly nearer towards his prey until the sudden note of the bird seemingly startles him and he jumps, scrambling a bit as he backs into a beaker of some clear liquid and it topples over to douse the kitten and he releases a lowly, pathetic mewl at his newly drenched state.

You laugh melodically at a gloomy sable kitten.

You say, "Oh you poor thing."

Luodo chuckles long and heartily at a gloomy sable kitten.

Santhaea takes a small cloth from the table nearby and gathers the kitten into her hands to dry him as best as she can.


Luodo Andarial says, "I think that was only water."

Luodo Andarial says, "At least...I hope so."

Luodo paces the floor, chewing his nails fretfully.

Taking off into flight at the abrupt racket caused by the kitten, a tiny songbird of shimmering color flits rapidly to perch atop Luodo's head, feathers hopelessly once again ruffled in its agitation. Releasing an abrupt torrent of chirps and tweets toward the kitten, the songbird once again attempts to resume preening itself.

You have emoted: Santhaea snickers softly at the bird and raises the kitten to her nose, sniffing against his wet fur to see what he was drenched with.

Luodo looks up at Colibri and says, "Ok...you can sit there...just make sure that's all you do.

Pathetically defeatist, a gloomy sable kitten slumps over against Santhaea's hands in a limp affirmation of its woeful defeat by a songbird, allowing himself to be dried. When prompted to Santhaea's nose, he stares balefully at her and releases a soft, strangled mewl once again.

You have emoted: Santhaea rubs her nose against the kitten's and murmurs to him, "You're lucky it was only water, darling." She sets him down on the ground, still damp but not dripping any longer.

Luodo reaches over and scratches the kitten betwixt his ears and says, "Be a little more careful Troublemaker...there's some stuff in here that'll reall hurt you.

Briefly glancing down towards its audible perch, a tiny songbird of shimmering color pleasantly picks at its feathers, comfortably preening itself - and then starting in on Luodo's hair, picking a strand and releasing it before repeating the process with a new strand.

A gloomy sable kitten meows endearingly at Luodo.

Luodo grins mischievously at a gloomy sable kitten.

Santhaea glances at the songbird and stretches her fingers to him, pressing them lightly against his belly to make him stand on her fingers. You say, "Come here, Colibri."

Luodo Andarial says to you, "The perfect camouflage...I'm a roost."

You laugh melodically at Luodo.

You say, "So you seem be, love."

Luodo chuckles long and heartily.

A tiny songbird of shimmering color complies, delicately perching atop Santhaea's finger, though it maintains one of Luodo's hairs, trying to rapidly finish preening him from Santhaea's fingertips before she should move them. 

Santhaea moves her hand carefully, kneeling before the kitten as she drops the bird within view of the damp kitten.

You say, "Trouble, this is Colibri.. you should get used to him."

Luodo chuckles long and heartily.

Luodo Andarial says to a gloomy sable kitten, "In Colibri's case...birds are friends...not food."

You snicker softly to yourself.


Casting an uncertain glance towards Santhaea at this new turn of events, a tiny songbird of shimmering color pauses in its natural preening to instead eye the predator before it, fluffing its feathers just so in a hopeless attempt to seem larger.

Santhaea keeps her other hand at the ready to intercept the kitten as she
murmurs to the bird, "It's alright, Colibri. This is important..."


Slowly coming to his feet, a gloomy sable kitten's tail sways once more as he eyes the songbird uncertainly in return. Prowling somewhat closer in a pitiably attempt to seem fierce, the kitten releases an attempt at a fierce hiss - the sound instead sputtering out against his protrusive fang, nearly startling himself this time.

Unable to restrain himself, Luodo begins laughing out loud.

Luodo Andarial says, "Sorry love."

Santhaea snickers softly, the sound barely audible.

You say, "No worries, darling."

You say to a gloomy sable kitten, "Now then, Trouble.."

You say to a gloomy sable kitten, "This bird is not food. Nor should you attack it."

A gloomy sable kitten makes a strangled meowing noise.

You say to a gloomy sable kitten, "I know he looks delicious.."

You say to a gloomy sable kitten, "But he really isn't.."

A tiny songbird of shimmering color gives you the once-over, eyeing you suspiciously.

You say to a tiny songbird of shimmering color, "Shhh."

Luodo whispers to Colibri, "Yes...we know that you are scrumptuous...but, we're trying to convince Trouble otherwise.."


Nearly reminiscent of grumbling, a tiny songbird of shimmering color releases a soft series of chirps before seeming relatively settled at Luodo's words. Resuming eyeing the kitten, the tiny bird inches the slightest bit forward towards the minute predator.

Firmly swatting once at the tiny avian, a gloomy sable kitten misses and inches back a fraction before peering up at Santhaea and releasing another soft mewl.

Santhaea taps the kitten firmly on the nose with a soft, "No." Santhaea watches the kitten carefully for another attempt.

Luodo Andarial says to you, "Heh...this might be a bit more involved Love."

A gloomy sable kitten makes a strangled meowing noise.

You say to Luodo, "Seems like it might be. Ah well.. I've plenty of patience."

Luodo grins mischievously.

Santhaea strokes her finger against the kitten's cheek and looks to see what Colibri will do.

Wrinkling his tiny nose up at the tap, a gloomy sable kitten settles back on his haunches once more, watching the bird with an absolute mistrust.

When the kitten seems less than likely to attack, a tiny songbird of shimmering color takes advantage of the moment in a soft flutter of tiny wings to perch atop the kitten's head, steadily resuming preening.

Santhaea giggles quietly and lets her hand drop that was holding the songbird, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

Abruptly startled, a gloomy sable kitten holds painstakingly still as he stares 
plaintively at Santhaea, clearly undecided.

Santhaea smiles encouragingly at the kitten and says to him, "Good job, 
Trouble! I'm proud of you!"

Remaining still for a moment longer, a gloomy sable kitten shakes his head abruptly, startling the bird off before he curls up by Santhaea's feet, closing his tiny eyes to doze.

Luodo Andarial says, "Poor little guy."

Fluttering upwards in startled flight, a tiny songbird of shimmering color perches atop Santhaea's shoulder to resume preening, seemingly unconcerned about its sudden uproosting.

You caress a tiny songbird of shimmering color gently.
