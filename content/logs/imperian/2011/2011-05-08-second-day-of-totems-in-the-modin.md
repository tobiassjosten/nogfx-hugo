Outside the gates of Stavenn. (road). (Ravana Hills.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. The shrunken head of 
Tryon has been staked into the ground here, the last torments of life still 
visible upon his face. The shrunken head of Orotu has been staked into the 
ground here, the last torments of life still visible upon his face. There are 2
shrunken heads of Ziat here. A pike with the decapitated head of Cardi has been
erected. A black, murky mist has settled here. An icewall is here, blocking 
passage to the west. A medal from an old war lies forgotten upon the ground. A 
black ouroboros oscillates endlessly here, staring at you with its many eyes.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, and the ominous gates of Stavenn 
lie to the west (gate open).

The icewall to the west is destroyed, exploding into a thousand shards of ice.

Near a large city. (road). (Ravana Hills.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A swirling vortex 
floats here. An ornately inscribed sign has been hung upon a black lacquered 
post. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Tossing his majestic 
silver head, a stallion of the Modin Valley stands here impassively.
You see exits leading northeast, east, southeast, southwest, and northwest.

Twisting highway track in hills. (road). (Ravana Hills.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. A swirling vortex 
floats here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Silent and 
observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a cunning glint of 
the eye. A massive, wild tiger with fierce, emerald eyes prowls the immediate 
area for prey. Fluttering about, a small sparrow twitters merrily. Whirling 
about in a sinuous blur, a lithe ferret blinks its beady eyes. A grumpy badger 
stands here, snuffling about angrily. A raven the colour of night perches 
nearby and observes curiously with beady black eyes. Prowling about on silent 
paws, a swift cheetah watches you closely.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, and southwest.
