Issue #101818   Reported by: Karyn    Re: Alceus
2011-12-13 09:15:44: Sexual Harrassment. In HELP HARASSMENT, it states that '_any_ sexual harassment whatsoever is banned'. This rule seems pretty self-explanitory, as it covers the actions performed on Karyn by Alceus. Karyn was fishing in the Shaahri desert alone like usual, and Alceus came into the room and spanked her multiple times (over 20 times, to a point of spamming). I've had no contact whatsoever with this person at all, so on top of being sexual harassment, it's also a grossly OOC offense. This type of offense is sensitive to me as it is highly inappropriate and lewd, inhibiting my ability to play. I've added some private information in a seperate issue that may relate to this case as well. Thank you in advance for your help in putting a stop to this for me and future players as well.
