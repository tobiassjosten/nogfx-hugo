Emeren Aevus says, "My apologies, was a bit out of my head.."

Emeren Aevus says, "Anyways."

Emeren Aevus says, "I also apologize for interupting you."

The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "You aren't going to get 
off that easy, Preceptor."

Pahm grabs Emeren by the arm and drags his face towards his shimmering sitara. "I am going to mark you, Preceptor. When people ask you how you got the scar, you will tell them that you've entered Pahm's Labyrinth 
uninvited."

Emeren growls, trying to push away from you. "Is this what you want?" He says 
through gritted teeth, eyeing the razor-sharp sitara.

"If you are willing to pester a snake, make sure you have the 
antidote for the venom." Pahm murmurs as his sitara carves deep into Emeren's 
right cheek and moves towards his chin, spilling Emeren's blood all over the 
Labyrinth.

Emeren says, "Stay back Isalu."

Isalu Amor'Fati says, "Whoa"

As Emeren falls to the floor, grabbing his face, Pahm leaps 
quickly at Isalu and cuts the tendons of her left leg, causing her to kneel.

You tell A masked man, "Is Isalu one of yours?"

Shou tells you, "Yes. What is she doing in your house?"

You tell A masked man, "You are coming to collect her corpse, aye?"

(PREDATOR SPAM)

Gritting your teeth, you put all your strength into your attack, blade humming as it lacerates Isalu from hip to shoulder.
The final blow proves too much for Isalu, who falls to the floor a broken, 
bloody mess.
You have slain Isalu.

Shou tells you, "That was uncalled for. Was she spying on you?"

You tell A masked man, "Aye."

You tell A masked man, "You have been allied. You may swifttrack to collect her corpse."

Emeren Aevus says, "She is Abhaen afterall."

You have emoted: The whispered voice of Pahm murmurs, "She was. Wipe the blood off your face, Preceptor. You are staining my floor."

A masked man says, "Body."

A masked man gives a sharp command to his wolf, which begins to sniff the air.

Shou tells you, "Maybe she wasn't trying to spy?"

You tell A masked man, "I haven't invited her into my home."

Shou tells you, "Well.. Sorry about that anyway."

Emeren begins to stitch his new scar with a needle and thread.

"No, you leave that there. You will live with that, Preceptor." Pahm says as he slaps Emeren's hand, causing him to drop the needle and thread on the bloody floor.

"I had uneasy feeling about her," Emeren says to himself, his voice filled with agitation. "Yes, I know I made a mistake and have paid for it," as he gingerly touches the gruesome work on his face. "But the likes of her is a cancer to the Idras as a whole."

Pahm drops the bloody sitara on the floor as he turns away from Emeren and murmurs with a trembling voice, "Preceptor... leave, please."

Emeren gives a short order to a savage grey wolf and it begins to sniff the 
air.
