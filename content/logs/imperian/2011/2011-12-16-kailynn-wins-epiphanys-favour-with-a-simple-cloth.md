the city and it is well representative of Life here. All of them have a place and make 
this city what it is. Simple items like these that you have brought to Me can mean a great
deal when you remember their Purpose."

still needs those in Life."

so, and once washed it is good as new.... and may become something amazing once given the 
chance."
