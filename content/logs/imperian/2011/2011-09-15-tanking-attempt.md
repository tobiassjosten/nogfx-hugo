Before a gate of the great desert city of Antioch. (road). (Shaahri desert.)
This has been marked as holy ground. A large piece of sandstone inscribed with 
the word 'WARNING!' juts upwards from the surrounding desert. Both fierce and 
protective, a massive statue of the Just Lord stands before the gates of 
Antioch, towering above the city walls. A ragged doll lies on the ground. 
Raised up on hind legs, eyes bright with intelligence and curiosity, a rare 
black mongoose is here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, southeast, northwest, and a set of 
ornately wrought, massive gates stand to the southwest (gate open).
