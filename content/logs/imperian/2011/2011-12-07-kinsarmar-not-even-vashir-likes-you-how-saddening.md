(Antioch): Ryax says, "Going to go piss off Kinsarmar if anyone wants to come."

A silver drop falls from the air, forming a silvery puddle with a looking glass surface. Images drift across the surface, a banana tree and a fluffy jambaali. Finally the image of Vashir is caught in the glass and he steps forth, Vorpal Sword in hand, the mirror fading in a silvery cloud.

Ryax blinks.

Icarius doffs his hat cordially at Vashir.

Vashir begins to wield a Jade Knife in His right hand.

Emiliana blinks.

Azyel gives Vashir a respectful salute.

Vashir says to Ryax, "Ready!"

Ryax raises his hand in greeting to Vashir and says "Hi!"

Aryse inclines her head, piously clasping her hands before her and bows to Vashir respectfully.

Emiliana bows respectfully to Vashir.

You give Vashir a compassionate hug.

Ryax ponders the situation.

"Heh heh heh," Icarius chuckles.

Cleric Ryax Lokrien, Flame of Baar says to Vashir, "For?"

You nod sagely.

You snuggle up close to Vashir, smiling happily.

Icarius Bharathian, The Flametouched says, "To piss off kinsarmar of course."

Icarius hums quietly to himself.

Ryax grins mischievously.

"Heh heh heh," you chuckle.

Vashir frowns and says, "Oh.. wasn't the invitation open to me?"

Cleric Ryax Lokrien, Flame of Baar says, "Oh, it was."

You throw your arms in the air and happily yell "YAY!" at Vashir.

Vashir says, "Fine fine.. Got to think of something else to do."

Cleric Ryax Lokrien, Flame of Baar says, "If You wish to come along, of course."

Vashir waves goodbye.

A silvery cloud appears, revealing a looking glass. Upon its surface moves a fluffy jambaali with eyes of flame, whiffling through a copse of pine trees. Vashir dashes into the looking glass, Vorpal Sword raised, and the glass ripples behind him before spattering the area with silver droplets.

Ryax grins mischievously.

Ryax waves goodbye.

Malikye blinks.

You snap your fingers.
