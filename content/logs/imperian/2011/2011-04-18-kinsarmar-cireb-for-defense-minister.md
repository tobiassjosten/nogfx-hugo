Subj: An Application for Minister of Defense-Cireb Murne

The following is Cireb's application for Minister of Defense.

Hello,

I am Cireb Murne.

Emperor of all that is mighty and known in the populace of Aetherius. I am writing to you today to apply for the position of Ministry of Defense. I have a long line of accomplishments behind my name, those including but not limited  to: Being an Mukhtar for 4 years, in which time I single-handedly negated eighteen seperate attacks on Antioch.

I'm one of the most intelligent and skilled combatants in this city and I feel that I would fill the position well.

I await my appointment,
Cireb Murne
 
Penned by my hand on the 25th of Halitus, in the year 635 AD.
