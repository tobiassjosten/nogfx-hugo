2011/01/02 02:59:27 - Sloan > oh ah.. can I object to Enteri .... boo Enteri.
2011/01/02 05:43:19 - Fitz inguilded Enteri.
2011/01/02 05:48:26 - Fitz declared that Enteri is no longer a formal enemy. 
Reason: We have enough enemies outside our walls, why have them inside too?
2011/01/02 07:26:08 - Shukron > You know I thought about staying in the Wytchen
but when Fitz inguilded Enteri! That changed it all. I don't need to be in this
Guild to kill him. Nor do I want to hear his voice on this Guild Channel. 
Plenty of people have spoken up and have said Enteri should not be here. But 
the Guild Master has denied the Guild Members voices so I will leave without 
hesitation bye.
2011/01/02 07:26:10 - Shukron quit the guild.
2011/01/02 07:27:58 - Avkrin quit the guild.
