The empty eastern square. (ruins of Caanae.)
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. A small sign points into a market
stall. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Quite difficult to make out, a ghost floats above the ground 
here, moaning to itself.
You see exits leading east, southwest, west, northwest, and in.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
It is raining lightly, and fat drops of rain fall pleasantly past. The spring of crystalline water 
gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant
river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made 
of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of light grey 
granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter cowardice. A plain metal chest
rests upon the ground here. A painted metal sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the
surrounding area. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A plain 
metal bench rests upon the ground here. A small sign points into a market stall. A detailed statue 
of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. 
A plain metal candlestick rests upon the ground here. A heart-shaped redwood canopy bed rests here 
with red silk curtains glimmering about it on all sides. A meticulous marble statue of a towering 
puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with
offerings. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its white 
marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and striking monument. An intricately carved statue 
of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of
a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth. A massive, sparkling wheel hovers here, a 
bejeweled arrow pointing straight up from the middle of the wheel. There are 2 eye sigils here. 
Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the Springs. A black wolf stalks silently here, 
sniffing the air for prey. Renkek, of the Third Order is here. He wields a tower shield in his left 
hand and a spiritual mace in his right. Lord Menoch Andarial, Animus Volatilis is here, shrouded. He
wields a tower shield in his left hand and a curved sabre in his right. Angel of Darkness, Lasine 
Ashtear, Lorhim Vaelokk is here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a curved sabre in 
her right.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway leads down.

Aryana's Spring. (ruins of Caanae.)
Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant clouds. The spring of 
crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling over the pillars to form a 
shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A
small oil lamp made of tin and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved 
statue of light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter 
cowardice. A plain metal chest rests upon the ground here. A painted metal sculpture resembling a 
man with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. A shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin 
demonologist lies in ruin here. A plain metal bench rests upon the ground here. A small sign points 
into a market stall. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a man with demonic 
features in the throes of feeble rage. A plain metal candlestick rests upon the ground here. A 
heart-shaped redwood canopy bed rests here with red silk curtains glimmering about it on all sides. 
A meticulous marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx pedestal, 
the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. This elegantly carved statue to Ab has been 
built in the center of the room, its white marble and sapphire form creating an impressive and 
striking monument. An intricately carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean 
hunter taking to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its mouth.
A massive, sparkling wheel hovers here, a bejeweled arrow pointing straight up from the middle of 
the wheel. There are 2 eye sigils here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his gaze cast over the 
Springs. A black wolf stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey. Renkek, of the Third Order is
here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right. Lord Menoch 
Andarial, Animus Volatilis is here, sprawled on the ground. He wields a tower shield in his left 
hand and a curved sabre in his right. Angel of Darkness, Lasine Ashtear, Lorhim Vaelokk is here, 
sprawled on the ground. She wields a tower shield in her left hand and a curved sabre in her right.
