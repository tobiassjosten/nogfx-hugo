Voice - Resonance

Syntax: RESONATE <CHI/TA/WE/NOTHING>

Your skill in Voice is now such that you can attune your words of power to one 
of the several primordial notes. Doing so increases the effect of your power 
words in various ways.

Each time you successfully hit a player with a power word, while resonating any
of these three notes, the target\'s body will start vibrating in tune with that 
note. As you keep attacking the target, the vibrations will increase.

The resonant vibrations will not last indefinitely - the effect will slowly 
wear off over time and will eventually fade entirely, if you do not maintain 
your offense against the individual.

It is important to note that resonance will have no effect if the target is 
shielded. In that case, the power word will still affect the target, but with 
the regular effectivity.

There are three primordial notes that affect power words:
Chi: Allows you to sing Voice words faster. The effect depends on how much the 
target is resonating with the Chi note.
Type MORE to continue reading. (66% shown)
<332/286h 424/424m 1334e 2021w <eb> <d>> more
Ta: This note increases the effect of certain power words, as listed below.
We: If the target is sufficiently resonating with the We note, your power words
will bypass deafness.

The Ta note affects the following power words:
Shaite/Rubait: increased damage
Llan: more health restored
Myried: longer stun
Kawis: bypasses levitation entirely if sufficiently resonating
Nuarinyu: chance to hit with two affliction instead of one, higher resonance 
means higher chance
The other power words are unaffected.
