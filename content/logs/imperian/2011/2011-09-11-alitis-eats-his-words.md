Kabaal has been hacked to death by an ominous orc warrior.
 
The ferry has arrived at Beneath the waterfall and you disembark the rickety 
craft.
Beneath the waterfall.
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
Pool of Inspiration rests here placidly at the base of a grand waterfall, 
shimmering with the silent promises of a new beginning. Beautifully crafted in 
polished white marble, a figure stands enshrouded in robes intricately detailed 
to appear nearly life-like. Swirling tendrils of soft light wrap themselves 
around the statue, bathing it in a bluish tinge. There are 4 charcoal cinders 
here.
You see exits leading in, and a crumbling pathway leads up.

Aryana's Spring. (lost) (ruins of Caanae.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The 
spring of crystalline water gushes forth from the ruins in a fountain, tumbling 
over the pillars to form a shallow and brilliant river among the stones, its 
ethereal light a source of inspiration and life. A small oil lamp made of tin 
and glass sits upon the floor, giving off a soft light. A well-carved statue of 
light grey granite stands here, depicting a Sylayan Noctusari in a pose of utter
cowardice. A plain metal chest rests upon the ground here. A painted metal 
sculpture resembling a man with a top hat looms over the surrounding area. A 
shattered statue of Slythera, a goblin demonologist lies in ruin here. A small 
sign points into a market stall. A detailed statue of light grey granite sets 
here depicting a man with demonic features in the throes of feeble rage. A plain
metal candlestick rests upon the ground here. A heart-shaped redwood canopy bed 
rests here with red silk curtains glimmering about it on all sides. A meticulous
marble statue of a towering puffin poses here, perched atop an ornate onyx 
pedestal, the large jade bowl at the base filled with offerings. This elegantly 
carved statue to Ab has been built in the center of the room, its white marble 
and sapphire form creating an impressive and striking monument. An intricately 
carved statue of light grey granite sets here depicting a Lycaean hunter taking 
to his heels. A stunning statue of a ssylsin stands here, marble foam about its 
mouth. A plain metal bench rests upon the ground here. Wrapped with silver 
ribbon, a sparkling bag of golden silk rests upon the ground here, topped with 
bow. From its perch, a night black hawk watches you intently with steady golden 
eyes. There are 4 savage grey wolves here. Tomast the Cleric stands here, his 
gaze cast over the Springs. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive 
warhorse stands here imperially.
You see exits leading north, east, south, west, in, and a crumbling pathway 
leads down.
