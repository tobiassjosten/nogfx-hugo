Issue #101724   Reported by: Karyn    Re: Cadeyrn
2011-11-09 11:37:09: 
Hello, I'll try to keep my emotions as much as I can out of this issue to be 
fair to everyone involved. However, I'm not going to let this kind of behavior happen to me, as it extremely upsets me beyond just in character and inhabits my ability (as a player) to play. I take sexual harassment extremely seriously, and I don't wish for this to escalate further, so I feel that this is the only way Cadeyrn's player will really understand how much I hate being treated like that. Karyn was standing out and fishing like she normally does, and Cadeyrn came out of nowhere and spanked her. She has hardly any interaction with Cadeyrn up until this point, so it was uncalled for. Cadeyrn left before Karyn could do anything, and she even tried to speak to him, and he responded that he will -try- not to do it again. I am extremely unhappy with that response, because I don't really thinks he understands the seriousness of sexual harassment but to try and ensure
that this behavior doesn't happen to me or anyone else, I am writing this issue.I hate being treated like that, more than anything else, and this extends far beyond how Karyn is IC. Nobody deserves to be treated like this.
