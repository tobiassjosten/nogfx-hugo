You reach out and clench a fist before Virtus, who screams and doubles over in 
agony as his skin suddenly bubbles with gangrenous growths.
A stream of primal darkness flows out from Virtus.
The bloodleech loses its grip on Virtus and drops to the ground.
A humbug loses its grip on Virtus and drops to the ground.
A worm loses its grip on Virtus and drops to the ground.
A green slime loses its grip on Virtus and drops to the ground.
A bubonis loses its grip on Virtus and drops to the ground.
Unable to maintain cohesion, Virtus\'s mutated and warped flesh sloughs off from
his bones as he collapses to the ground in a twisted heap.
You have slain Virtus.
You reach over to comfort Virtus as he falls to the overall level of 
Archmortal.


Virtus tells you, "Nice afk kill. Now come try while I\'m here.\"


That person has chosen to ignore you.
