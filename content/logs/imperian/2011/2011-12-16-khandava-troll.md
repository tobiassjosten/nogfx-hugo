You follow Wiliam to the east.
Monarch Square.
The land and plantlife here has been blackened and burned. A small bronze grate seals an entrance to the warrens here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. The gargantuan form of a twisted black leechwood tree spirals up into the sky. A thick tangle of twisted red roots pulses and groans, growing en masse along the ground. A shadowveil is here, focusing moonlight. The lantern swings noisily on its hook, the sound of grating metal setting your nerves on edge. There are a group of 3 saltpetres here. Peering at several leaves, Lyrinan wanders about. Its long, smooth tail curled around its legs, an exotic canine sits here peacefully. A lean coyote prowls around the area, his nose sniffing along the ground for prey. Roudimus is here pacing back and forth, his thorny maw set in a vicious scowl. A scruffy grey alley cat sits here pointedly ignoring you as it cleans its fur. A muscular vorep prowls around here. There are 2 massive, winged fell beasts here. A massive bazwolf paces the floor savagely, thick strands of foam hanging from its muzzle. A black wolf stalks silently here, sniffing the air for prey. A sleek black hound stands stone still, ears perked and alert. A gnarled treant stands here, wisps of smoke and flame escaping its mouth. Heated breath flaring his nostrils, a massive warhorse stands here imperially. With a wild look in his eye, a feral paint stallion stands heatedly here as he stomps and paces recklessly. The undead form of Lionas Sol'Anlumaire, Redwood Blight is here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in his left hand and a tower shield in his right. The effects of this location have been twisted under a demonic influence. 
You see exits leading northeast, east, south, and west.
  
Wiliam says to Lionas, "Greetingsh shimpleton."
  
You say to Wiliam, "How are our parentsh fundsh?"
  
You nod your acknowledgement of Lionas.
  
Lionas raises an eyebrow at Wiliam.
  
You say, "More than theshe shimpletonsh can handle I preshume."
  
Lionas Sol'Anlumaire, Redwood Blight says, "I suggest you leave my council."
  
You say to Lionas, "Greetingsh, shimpleton, we are currently checking on the 
progressh of our shalvesh for our parentsh."
  
You say, "Making shure our income ish where it should be."
  
You say, "I asshume you are working hard, yesh?"
  
Wiliam says to Lionas, "I shuggesht you shtroke my chin with your shimple 
handsh, shimpleton."
  
Wiliam stares at Lionas intently as he approaches him, sucking his thumb 
absently minded. Wiliam stops for a moment, watching Lionas closely as he 
withdraws his thumb from his mouth and wipes it on Lionas's arm.
  
Wiliam steps on Lionas's feet and he cups his chin, stroking his own with his 
free hand. "Well formed chin, shir." Wiliam comments right before he places a 
quick kiss upon the tip of Lionas's nose and steps back, returning to normal as
if nothing had happened.
  
You have emoted: Eugene gives a totally blank stare for several seconds, he 
puts his finger into his mouth briefly, covering his fingertip with saliva.
  
You have emoted: Eugene gives Lionas a eager look, scrunching up his face, 
reaching over with his wet finger and placing it directly into Lionas's ear. He
lingers for a second and then withdraws it, his face returning to normal as if 
nothing had happened.
  
Lionas has declared you a formal enemy of the Council of Khandava.
  
A cannon ball races in from the east, rips through Wiliam's body, and streaks 
westward.
A cannon ball races in from the east, rips through your body, and streaks 
westward.
A cannon ball races in from the west, rips through Wiliam's body, and streaks 
eastward.
A massive net flies in from the west, entangles itself about you and you fall 
to the ground unable to move.
  
Brandishing his quarterstaff, an elite smoldering treant cries to the skies and
a bolt of lightning strikes you, the electric shock causing your limbs to 
spasm.
You have been slain by an elite smoldering treant. (all)

The soul of Wiliam says, "How quaint!"

You say, "Indeed."

You say, "Shimpletonsh."

You say, "Cannot comprehend our wealth."
