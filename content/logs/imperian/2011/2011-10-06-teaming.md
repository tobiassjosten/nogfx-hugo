The soul of Ephemeral Phantasm, Sliff Virs, Sanctuary of Sinners says, "Wow. 
Teaming now?"

A slender, snowy-platinum songbird begins to sing a trilling song.

Climbing rolling hills. (Demon's Pass.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
decaying remains of Sliff lie here. A small orphine seed lies here. There are 2
small black cobras here. Stamping his golden hooves and tossing his crimson 
mane, this blooded warhorse stands here bearing a regal strength. A serene, 
slender, snowy platinum songbird is here, watching all about him with 
benevolent eyes as his soothing song flows toward the heavens. A serpentine 
demonic lamia is hissing here. A small firefly floats through the air, its 
light blinking lazily. A peaceful aura fills the area, emanating from Mathiu, 
Aspect of Aryana. He wields a truesilver shield in his left hand and a sapphire
harp in his right. Bringer Of Rain, Sidartha Devilen, The Indomitable Curse is 
here. He wields a stone totem in his hands.
