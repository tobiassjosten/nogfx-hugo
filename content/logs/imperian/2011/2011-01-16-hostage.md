Within the influence of the demonic rift.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth.
You can see no further.

<445/445h 324/336m 2119e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  shadow mih

Underneath a short, scrubby tree.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The 
undead form of Seeker's Flame, Mihochi Wyrdim the Despondent Lily is here. She 
is holding a tower shield in her right hand.
You see exits leading southeast and northwest.
Your clumsy attempt to shadow Mihochi is useless against her sharp eyesight, 
and in your shame and failure you stand revealed to all.
Balance Taken: 3.25s

Nothing can be seen here by that name. Need new targets!

<445/445h 324/336m 2120e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  
Mihochi pokes at you.

You slowly make your away around behind Mihochi, far enough away to remain 
inconspicuous.
Balance Taken: 3.25s

You have recovered balance.
<445/445h 324/336m 2119e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  
Mihochi looks at you curiously, her ears perking in interest.
<445/445h 324/336m 2119e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  
As you approach Mihochi's back, you quietly draw your knife to the ready, 
holding it low and out of sight.
<445/445h 324/336m 2119e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  
The crimson and shadowed sun completes a revolution, striking fear in the 
hearts of lesser creatures.
<445/445h 324/336m 2121e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  
With one last, silent step, you find yourself directly behind Mihochi and 
prepare yourself for the pounce.
<445/445h 324/336m 2121e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  
A flick of the wrist, a flash of your blade, and you take Mihochi hostage with 
your knife to her throat.
<445/445h 324/336m 2122e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  'you killed my wolf

You say, "You killed my wolf."
<445/445h 324/336m 2122e 1581w 30x <ebpp>> <LL:0 RL:0 HE:0 TO:0 LA:0 RA:0>  execute hostage

You swiftly drag the edge of your knife across Mihochi's throat, splitting 
flesh and severing arteries. A torrent of blood begins to flow from the 
horrible wound in her neck as she topples to the ground, turning around to give
you a look of despair as the light slowly fades from her eyes.
You have slain Mihochi.
You reach over to comfort Mihochi as she falls to the pk level of Invincible.
