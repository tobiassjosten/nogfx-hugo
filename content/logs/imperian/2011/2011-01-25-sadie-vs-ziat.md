You crash through the undergrowth that obstructs your way.
Flourishing woodland.
Chattering animals and whistling birds make this seem more like the middle of 
the Celidon forest than the ruins of an ancient arena. The forest has truly 
come in to entirely reclaim this area. Tall trees stand here, vines connecting 
them, while flowers and other fauna thrive on the ground. A large beehive hangs
down from the trees above. A massive groomed black stallion stands here 
proudly, its large form covered in silver battle armour. A swarm of bees hovers
menacingly nearby. A mighty earth golem stands guard here. A peaceful aura 
fills the area, emanating from Ziat, Aspect of Aryana. He wields The Conqueror 
of the Void in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading east, south, and down.
