The Diner at the Beginning of the Universe. (KAZZUK3)
Chairs and tables have been arranged across the checkered floor of this retro diner. A chrome-plated self serve soda fountain sits on the counter against the west wall with vintage Slusho glasses sitting stacked to the side.

A swinging door to the north bears the phrase, "Don't Panic" in bright, cheery letters.
