The Crossroads of Reality                         (HAVEN)
Myriad quantum paths wind through the universes towards this place, all converging in a maelstrom of reality itself, shifting dimensions as the threads of space and time twist and flow all around.
A tiny, blue-green hummingbird flaps its wings in rapid succession here, zipping around restlessly. Meany Lyrian is here.
You see exits leading to the north, south, up and out.
The path to hell lies here.
