A narrow sluice in the river                     
The canyon walls narrow at this juncture, forcing the racing water into a narrow
sluice. The river has been churned into a frothing mess as the rapidly narrowing
channel puts tremendous pressure on the raging waters, turning them into a
torrent.
A rugged bandit surveys the area here, looking for easy prey.
You see exits leading to the southwest and northwest.
