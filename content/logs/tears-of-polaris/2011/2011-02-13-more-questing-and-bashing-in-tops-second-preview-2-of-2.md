The entrance to a landing pad.
At this edge of the landing platform, a low metal ramp has been installed from 
the trail of packed earth below, up to the platform, which stands about a metre 
off the ground. On either side of the ramp, a railing runs around the perimeter 
of the platform. A communication console has been installed to the south. 
Flickering landing lights encircle the safe landing zone to the west. To the 
north, another ramp leads down to an earthen trail that leads to two monumental 
crates that stretch about as long as this platform.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand. This area is badly burned.
A tall greeting droid stands here. Two corpses of Allos lie here haphazardly. 
Five corpses of Lyve lie here haphazardly. Five corpses of Krax lie here 
haphazardly. A fat sand rat has been exterminated and left to rot here. Three 
corpses of Kirraxus lie here haphazardly. Two small pills marked with a nerve

1.4 Environment

This scroll is intended mainly for those who are not familiar with the basic way
in which text MUDs work.

Imagine a world, complete with continents, mountains, rivers, cities, deserts, 
forests, and so on. Then, imagine that world divided up into sections of varying
size. These sections, called ROOMS, can be of any size, from a nook in a hall to
a large section of a desert. Generally, indoor rooms will represent much less 
space than outdoor rooms but this rule, like most rules, has exceptions.

Imagine yourself standing in a room that is a box canyon. To your west, you can 
walk back out of this dead-end of a canyon. Or, you spy a small animal trail 
heading up the side of a precarious, but barely traversable, mountain-side. You 
could then go either UP or WEST, simply by typing one of these commands. By 
typing LOOK you will see a description of the room you are in including exits. 
You will learn more about this sort of thing in later help scrolls.

So then, rooms have exits leading to other rooms. Possible directions are -- 
MORE --
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - more

north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, 
in, and out. Now, there are also many items and DENIZENS (creatures or people 
controlled by the game) that you can interact with. To see if there are any in 
the room with you, type LOOK and read what is there. If you can use ansi colour,
you can type CONFIG ANSI ON. Then, items in a room will be a different colour 
from the description of the room.

One important thing to understand about items and denizens is that they all have
a unique identifying number. You may see this number by typing INFO HERE (or 
just IH) for things in a room with you, or INFO INV (or just II) to see things 
in your INVENTORY (see below). This number may be Substituted for the name of 
the item or denizen if you wish to specify a particular vial, or a particular 
sword, for instance. Example: a shining steel sword#2034

Finally, you should understand the concept of your inventory. This is basically 
what you are carrying on your person. Likely as not, you will end up with quite 
a collection if you play for any length of time. Typing INVENTORY (or just INV) 
will show you what you are holding.

A secluded spot among the dunes.
The path is almost entirely lost here between two low, long dunes of shining 
white sand. Snake trails have been left here as a subtle warning to 
overambitious travellers. The top of a stump pokes out of a nearby dune, its 
bark appearing thin and smooth. It has been worn down by the sand, but deep claw
marks are still visible in the bark.
A young man lies on the ground in obvious pain. An iridescent beetle crawls 
across the ground.

An obscured path among the dunes.
It takes a careful eye to notice that what appears to be nothing more than an 
insignificant flat area in an expanse of desert is in fact a road of packed 
earth obscured by time and sand, but still navigable. The road loses itself in a
dune only to re-emerge from a trough, but it is possible to discern that it is 
making its way south.

Upon a mountain of dull sand.
The edge of the mining field is a place of contrast. White dunes surround dark 
piles of processed sand. Crumbled sandstone has been crushed under the treads of
heavy machinery. Beyond the ravaged mining field, pristine white dunes stretch 
on to the horizon in every direction. On the northern and eastern horizon, a 
long strip of greenery contrasts starkly against the appearance of flat, 
inhospitable desert.
Two corpses of Oronar lie here haphazardly. The corpse of Seuter lies here.

The edge of a mining field.
Brown, discoloured sand has been piled on top of the clean, white sand and has 
started to spread like a disease into the desert. On the northwestern side of 
this heap are sweeping dunes. The other side has been stripped clean down to the
bedrock, which bears wide tread marks of extremely heavy machinery.
You see exits leading to the east, south and southwest.

Atop a mountain of discoloured sand.
From this vantage point, most of the mining field can be seen as well as a great
vista of the desert and a dark paved road that winds through it to the 
northeast. The sand making up this large pile is darker than the surrounding 
dunes, discoloured to almost a brown hue. To the south, huge, dark machines 
provide a stark contrast to the white dunes, leaving exposed, crumbling bedrock 
in their wake.
A large rat nest has been built here. A fat sand rat scurries about in search of
food.

Near a giant sand miner.
A long strip of bedrock has been exposed here with giant trenches gouged out of 
it. Huge tread marks roughly ten feet wide lead towards a huge sand mining 
machine further towards the centre of the field. Huge mounds of discoloured sand
have been piled unnaturally high to the side.
An iridescent beetle crawls across the ground.

With a squeak, a fat sand rat scurries in from the northwest.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - 
In the shadow of a giant sand miner.
Towering many times higher than the dunes, a massive, rusted, box-shaped sand 
miner is here, its teeth dug into the sandstone bedrock. Its wide treads are 
just slightly taller than the average human. A mountain of sand, looking 
slightly duller than the surrounding dunes, is piled off to the side. Smaller 
piles of sandstone litter the area.
The Chief Engineer stands here, obviously preoccupied with the huge sand miner.
There is a single exit here to the east.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - give oil to engineer

You give a tank of machine lubricant to Oliver the Chief Engineer.
Oliver the Chief Engineer says, "Hey, way to go, Aurulius! I see you found that 
flake. He was probably off somewhere whining about his mommy; can't handle a 
little sand in his drawers."
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - 
Oliver the Chief Engineer says, "I owe you a little something for helpin' me 
out!"
Oliver the Chief Engineer takes a big step toward you, arms thrown wide to his 
sides.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - 
Oliver the Chief Engineer frowns a bit, arms dropping quickly. With red in his 
cheeks, he hands you a handful of E-Cur.

Entrance to a sand mining field.
Piles of sandstone lie cast aside here, catching sand on their windward side and
developing their own dunes. To the west, long shallow trenches have been carved 
out of exposed bedrock, which is covered by wide tread marks. Further in the 
distance, huge, dark, rectangular machines stand out against the white sands.
The corpse of Oronar lies here. The corpse of Seuter lies here. A large rat nest

Centre of private mining camp.
Amid a cluster of tents, two especially stand out. A long black pavilion has 
been set up to the east, providing shelter for cargo and crew. The other has 
been set up to the northeast and labelled in white letters on the black material
that read, "Headquarters." Beside it, the packed earth gives way to a paved road
that snakes out to the north.

The outskirts of a private mining camp.
Most of the trash from the camp has accumulated on the outskirts. An 
air-conditioned outhouse is stationed just outside the cluster of tents. Litter 
ranging from paper scraps to broken bits of machinery have been tossed aside 
here, out of the way of the normal flow of traffic. To the east, a large tent 
smelling faintly of decaying food houses the mess hall.
You see exits leading to the north, east and south.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand. This area is badly burned.
A tall greeting droid stands here. Two corpses of Allos lie here haphazardly. 
Five corpses of Lyve lie here haphazardly. Five corpses of Krax lie here 
haphazardly. A fat sand rat has been exterminated and left to rot here. Three 
corpses of Kirraxus lie here haphazardly. Two small pills marked with a nerve 
lie here. A small mound of live E-units have been left here.
Lyve is here. Krax is here.

Havens of the Touched.
Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal's plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface. 
This area is badly burned.

A cluttered workshop.
Tools are littered about this small, one-room workshop.
A sturdy forge stands here, cold and dark. A large atomic refinery has been 
installed here. Nine spools of wire have been stacked here. The corpse of Tecton
lies here. The corpse of Kirraxus lies here. A sturdy workbench stands here, 
tools and vices neatly arranged and ready for use. Two ruby crystals have been 
carelessly dropped here. A group of fourteen platinum ingots have been left 
here.
Lord Kirraxus Hrrakn is here. Farah is here. Meldaire is here.
There is a single exit here to the up.

Within a trading post.
A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy 
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the 
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of 
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted 
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here, 
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent 
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents 
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is 
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this 
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.

An outdoor trading shop.
Carved out of a large sandstone rock formation, this trading post is small, 
providing just enough room for several patrons to enter and still be within the 
carving of the rock. A makeshift countertop has been carved out of the maroon 
coloured sandstone, proving a bit of separation from the patron and the merchant
and provides a small space to layout items to be reviewed for purchase. Due to 
the shallowness of the carving, this post provides almost no protection from the
weather. Behind the counter a small hole can be seen carved into the rock, with 
a wooden door covering it. The brass hinges of the door have been bolted into 
the rock in an attempt to keep it in place and protect whatever is behind it, be
it more wares or personal space.
A ball-peen hammer lies here. A compact phaser lies here in danger of getting 
damaged. An iron mace lies discarded here. A steel rapier has been discarded 
here. A group of two bars of steel have been left here.

The Diner at the Beginning of the Universe.
Chairs and tables have been arranged across the checkered floor of this retro 
diner. A chrome-plated self serve soda fountain sits on the counter against the 
west wall with vintage Slusho glasses sitting stacked to the side. A distinctive
jukebox sits in the northwestern corner of the room with real vinyl records and 
an archaic coin slot. A swinging door to the north bears the phrase, "Don't 
Panic" in bright, cheery letters.
You see exits leading to the east, west and down.
A doorway of blinding light stands upright in the middle of the room. (ENTER

Within a trading post.
A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy 
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the 
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of 
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted 
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here, 
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent 
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents 
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is 
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this 
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.

There is a single exit here to the west.
Thin tendrils of fog, each barely a wisp, coil toward you. As they get closer 
long and crooked fingers form at the end of each, spread wide to grasp whatever 
they come in contact with. Just as the devilish hands close over your arms and 
legs they vanish into thin air.

simple circular crossguard and a simple cross-hatched       
pattern to on the otherwise featureless grip to keep it

A long, straight, thin blade, extremely light. The          
crossguard and grip are disappointingly simple, however;    
the design is marked by pointed elegance.

He is a insect-like Velkin of average stature and build. His average sized head 
sits atop an average length neck, which is in turn nested between two rather 
average shoulders from which hang very average arms. Beneath said shoulders 
and,thus, between said arms one might find a rather average torso, fitted below 
withan average waist which splits into two average legs, footed by average feet.
Then again, one might not.
He is wearing a Trekat-issue bag, a gold-trimmed, flowing shirt and a pair of 
tight white pants.
He is wielding a wooden mallet in his right hand.

An outdoor trading shop.
Carved out of a large sandstone rock formation, this trading post is small, 
providing just enough room for several patrons to enter and still be within the 
carving of the rock. A makeshift countertop has been carved out of the maroon 
coloured sandstone, proving a bit of separation from the patron and the merchant
and provides a small space to layout items to be reviewed for purchase. Due to 
the shallowness of the carving, this post provides almost no protection from the
weather. Behind the counter a small hole can be seen carved into the rock, with 
a wooden door covering it. The brass hinges of the door have been bolted into 
the rock in an attempt to keep it in place and protect whatever is behind it, be
it more wares or personal space.
A ball-peen hammer lies here. A compact phaser lies here in danger of getting 
damaged. An iron mace lies discarded here. A steel rapier has been discarded 
here. A group of two bars of steel have been left here.

Assembling the raw materials for a steel katana, you concentrate intensely on 
your work as you start to shape the material to your wishes. Using a wooden 
mallet where necessary, the material slowly takes shape, transforming into the 
rough form of a steel katana. Adding a few last details to the overall shape, 
you put a wooden mallet aside, finally finished with a steel katana.

The Diner at the Beginning of the Universe.
Chairs and tables have been arranged across the checkered floor of this retro 
diner. A chrome-plated self serve soda fountain sits on the counter against the 
west wall with vintage Slusho glasses sitting stacked to the side. A distinctive
jukebox sits in the northwestern corner of the room with real vinyl records and 
an archaic coin slot. A swinging door to the north bears the phrase, "Don't 
Panic" in bright, cheery letters.

Within a trading post.
A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy 
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the 
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of 
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted 
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here, 
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent 
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents 
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is 
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this 
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.
You can view what this shop has for sale using WARES.

An ancestral curve of modern tempered steel. It features a  
simple circular crossguard and a simple cross-hatched       
pattern to on the otherwise featureless grip to keep it     
from slipping.

A long, straight, thin blade, extremely light. The          
crossguard and grip are disappointingly simple, however;    
the design is marked by pointed elegance.

Within a trading post.
A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy 
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the 
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of 
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted 
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here, 
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent 
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents 
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is 
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this 
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.

you put a wooden mallet aside, finally finished with a steel rapier.

A large wall tent makes up the shop area of this trading post, the heavy 
off-white canvas of the tent protecting the wares and patrons inside from the 
environment. Wooden boxes of various shades of browns make up the majority of 
the shopping area, their hinged doors locked open to provide unrestricted 
viewing to their contents for prospective shoppers. The floor is open here, 
exposing the sand of the desert below which contains the footprints of recent 
shoppers and the occasional small critter that sneaks in through the tents 
tied-back door flaps. A separate flap divides the tent in almost half, but is 
closed and tied, providing access to the living area of the owner of this 
establishment and leaving the wares in the front part of the tent.

The Diner at the Beginning of the Universe.
Chairs and tables have been arranged across the checkered floor of this retro 
diner. A chrome-plated self serve soda fountain sits on the counter against the 
west wall with vintage Slusho glasses sitting stacked to the side. A distinctive
jukebox sits in the northwestern corner of the room with real vinyl records and 
an archaic coin slot. A swinging door to the north bears the phrase, "Don't 
Panic" in bright, cheery letters.
Xan is here.
You see exits leading to the east, west and down.

The Diner at the Beginning of the Universe.
Chairs and tables have been arranged across the checkered floor of this retro 
diner. A chrome-plated self serve soda fountain sits on the counter against the 
west wall with vintage Slusho glasses sitting stacked to the side. A distinctive
jukebox sits in the northwestern corner of the room with real vinyl records and 
an archaic coin slot. A swinging door to the north bears the phrase, "Don't 
Panic" in bright, cheery letters.
You see exits leading to the east, west and down.
A doorway of blinding light stands upright in the middle of the room. (ENTER

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal's plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand. This area is badly burned.

large rats.

The outskirts of a private mining camp.
Most of the trash from the camp has accumulated on the outskirts. An 
air-conditioned outhouse is stationed just outside the cluster of tents. Litter 
ranging from paper scraps to broken bits of machinery have been tossed aside 
here, out of the way of the normal flow of traffic. To the east, a large tent 
smelling faintly of decaying food houses the mess hall.
Two sand rats scurry about in their quest for food.
You see exits leading to the north, east and south.
1301/1301H 1301/1301M - n

Centre of private mining camp.
Amid a cluster of tents, two especially stand out. A long black pavilion has 
been set up to the east, providing shelter for cargo and crew. The other has 
been set up to the northeast and labelled in white letters on the black material
that read, "Headquarters." Beside it, the packed earth gives way to a paved road
that snakes out to the north.

A road in the desert.
The end of a road is here, marking the boundary of a temporary mining camp. To 
the south, packed earth leads among the small forest of tents. To the north, the
road meanders through the dunes, large enough for heavy vehicles to use it.
You see exits leading to the north and south.
1301/1301H 1301/1301M - n

A bend in the desert road.
The paved black road winds lazily among the dunes, leading off to the north and 
southeast. All around, pristine white dunes rise up like waves waiting to crash 
down on careless passersby. Only the edges of the road are swallowed by the 
sands.
You see exits leading to the south and northwest.

There is no exit in that direction.
1301/1301H 1301/1301M - nw

A rise along a desert road.
As the paved road rises to the top of one dune, a vista opens up of seemingly 
endless sands, dotted only rarely by the occasional stump. Towards the south, a 
small mining camp has been established. Giant craters have been dug out of the 
sand, exposing bedrock. Huge piles of sand have been swept aside. To the east, 
the desert suddenly drops off and gives way to an expansive, sparkling ocean.
You see exits leading to the north and southeast.
1301/1301H 1301/1301M - n

Near an intersection.
The cracked paved road leads through a depression among the dunes. The sand is 
blown back from the road, leaving it clear for travel. Nevertheless, the dunes 
overshadow the road like giant ocean waves. To the northeast, a large 
intersection can be seen.
Standing resolute, a huge armoured guard defends the area. Eight corpses of 
Kirraxus lie here haphazardly.
You see exits leading to the northeast and south.

A desert intersection.
The paved road branches off here, leading in four separate directions. The road 
dips to the southwest before rising up above the dunes. Three roads lead in a 
northern direction, each making its own way through the sands to an unseen 
destination. Small piles of sand lie strewn about the intersection, cast from 
the dunes by the wind.
You see exits leading to the north, northeast, southwest and northwest.
1301/1301H 1301/1301M - n

Near a desert intersection.
The paved road winds like a river of civilization through the otherwise barren 
dunes. A large intersection has been built to the south, with roads branching 
off in three other directions. Tall dunes have built up beside the road, 
partially sheltering it from the sun. Above the dunes to the north, a hill rises
out of the sand and is crowned on top with a large white compound.
You see exits leading to the north and south.

Tall monochromatic flags of alternating azure and maroon line either side of

Near a desert intersection.
The long white dunes have been piled high on both sides of the black paved road.
The road runs parallel to the dunes in a northwest and southeast direction. 
Small piles of sand have fallen onto the sides of the road from the dunes. The 
dunes subside to the northwest, being replaced with colourful, barren mineral 
fields.
You see exits leading to the southeast and northwest.
1301/1301H 1301/1301M - nw

On the edge of a polluted expanse of sand.
Undulating white dunes border a wasteland of caked sand that has been 
contaminated with chemicals, painting a bizarre landscape of fluid 
multi-coloured shapes. To the northwest, a gargantuan hemisphere has been stuck 
in the ground, its flat side facing east like a satellite dish. A comparatively 
tiny tunnel at the base reveals that the geometric shape is actually a facility 
of some kind.
You see exits leading to the southeast and west.

A road through fields of coloured sand.
Surrounded by mountainous white dunes on all sides, the field of minerals that 
this road runs straight through has been painted with the mineral and chemical 
runoff from a massive silver hemisphere that has been constructed to the 
northwest. Reds, blues, greens, and other, more bizarre colours all mingle to 
compose psychedelic figures in the sand.
You see exits leading to the east and northwest.

Near a hemispherical facility.
To the north, a giant silver hemisphere has been stuck in the ground with the 
flat side facing east. A black, bowl-shaped solar array of the same size is 
swivelled towards the sky. A tunnel projects from the southern base of the 
hemisphere. Blue-tinted sliding glass doors allow entrance inside the building. 
The road runs in a straight line northwest and southeast through land that, 
though relatively flat, is painted with many colours due to the high 
concentration of minerals and chemicals in the sand.

This solid white tunnel has blue-tinted sliding glass doors on either side and a
long, sand-covered blue tacky mat on the ground. The doors to the south lead out

wasteland. The doors to the north open into a short, solid white hallway with

glass doors in the south end of the room lead out to a sandy airlock, beyond 
which lies the desert. To the west, a pair of swinging doors opens out to a 
large room with a staircase. A cool blue light streams through the northern

flat side facing east. A black, bowl-shaped solar array of the same size is 
swivelled towards the sky. A tunnel projects from the southern base of the 
hemisphere. Blue-tinted sliding glass doors allow entrance inside the building. 
The road runs in a straight line northwest and southeast through land that, 
though relatively flat, is painted with many colours due to the high 
concentration of minerals and chemicals in the sand.

On a straight road.
A paved road stretches to the northwest and southeast through a flat, 
chemical-tainted wasteland. There's not a single sign of vegetation anywhere, 
making the huge silver dish-shaped structure to the northeast starker than its 
geometric form already made it. To the northwest, the road bends left, winding 
through the colourful flat land.

A bend in a flat road.
The paved road makes a sharp bend here on the western side of a tall silver 
facility in the shape of a hemisphere with its flat side facing east. The sand 
around the facility has been permeated with chemicals, painting the sands with 
swirls of various colours. An oily sheen near the base of the facility reveals 
where some of the chemicals have started to pool.

Passing a massive hemispherical facility.
The road passes by the rounded side of a silver hemispherical facility that

A bend by a salt bed.
A bed of large white salt crystals lies off to the north, a solid patch of white
amid the bizarrely painted sands. The paved road winds around the salt bed, 
heading both south and northeast. To the south, a large silver hemispherical 
structure has been built about half a kilometre away, its flat side facing east 
like a giant satellite dish.

Near a salt deposit.
The paved road winds through the relatively flat but colourful desert. To the 
west, a bed of small salt rocks sits as a sea of white in a desert of mingling 
colours. The road stretches on to the north and southwest, with a silver 
hemispherical building sitting in either direction at equal distances. The 
building to the north has not yet been finished, but white upright supports keep
it balanced.

Amid the painted sands.
The barren flat land has been painted grotesque colours by chemical 
contaminants. The colours radiate like twisted spokes from the base of a large 
silver hemispherical facility to the south. To the northeast, another similar

the contaminated area. Oily puddles dot the landscape where liquid pollutants 
have seeped to the surface. The black paved road winds leisurely to the south

The alabaster dunes from the east taper off here, where they are replaced by a 
contaminated wasteland of sand that has been painted with bizarre coloured

with its flat side facing east is under construction, its partially shaped form 
still largely supported by scaffolding.

A crumbling roadway.
A navigable roadway follows the course of the ravines west and southeast, but 
here at the junction of sands it is falling swiftly to ruin.  The dusty surface 
of the road is badly cracked in places as if by seismic upheaval or the pressure
of heavy weight, rendering it impassable to most vehicles.  Rocky nuggets of 
crumbled surfacing line the sides of the path.  Every so often larger blocks 
have been separated from the whole, rent with great force and carved with what 
appear to be giant toothmarks.  An undeveloped gorge slopes up toward the 
southern desert.

The bottom of a stairwell.
A pair of swinging clear doors in the east wall opens into the bottom of this 
stairwell, where white stairs of a plastic-like material lead up to a landing at
the second storey of the facility. The floor, walls, and high ceiling all have 
been covered with white panels about a metre square. The west wall curves out 
from the floor to the ceiling. Small holes, about a centimetre in diameter, have
been drilled in the panelling on the western wall, exposing a silver foil behind
it.

The landing at the top of the stairs is covered in the same white panelling as 
the rest of the room. A white plastic railing runs along the edge of the 
landing. Below, the base of the stairs is visible. The tall western wall is 
bowed out and the panelling covering it has been cut to fit and drilled with 
countless tiny holes, through which silver foil is visible. A wide white sliding
door in the eastern wall allows entrance into a small hallway that is similarly 
sparsely decorated and covered in white panelling.

about working for the three companies."

Landon the Guard says, "There are three major factions on this planet aside from
our company: the intellectual Jrec, the warmongering Ekat, and the opulent 
Leat."
1301/1301H 1301/1301M -

northwest, where they perform experiments and study the planet. If you are 
interested in such things, find the clerk and GREET her to learn how to work for
them."
1301/1301H 1301/1301M - 
Landon the Guard says, "The Ekat empire is, as always, attempting to wrest 
control from the other empires. Their fortress lies along the road north of 
here, atop a sandstone hill. If you're of a mercenary disposition, GREET the 
military policeman for your first assignment with them."

Landon the Guard says, "And finally, the Leat empire runs a fine resort 
northeast of here along the beach. If you GREET the receptionist there, he's 
bound to have a position available for you, even if it's just as a tour guide."
1301/1301H 1301/1301M -

one you want to know more about."

Landon the Guard says, "The Ekat empire is carrying on their warmongering ways 
here. They were the last faction to come to the planet, but they have already 
established a formidable presence by aggressive mining and industrial sabotage. 
If you're strong enough, you might find that they'll hire you for jobs ranging 
from industrial sabotage to harvesting zytin. Their fortress is along the most 
direct northern road."

You ask, "Jrec."
Landon the Guard says, "The Jrec empire is renowned for their mental dexterity. 
They have built a scientific facility to the northwest, but a chemical leak has 
resulted in contamination of the sands around their facility. Their primary 
purpose here is scientific research, but they need to harvest zytin to cover 
their operating expenses. You may be able to find work with them cleaning up the
sands, maintaining miners, or maybe even performing science experiments."

You ask, "Leat."
Landon the Guard says, "The Leat empire has perfected the art of commerce. Their
resort along the eastern road is open to all. Their primary source of income is 
in hospitality and tourism, leading groups through the northern jungle on 
sightseeing trips and hunting expeditions. If you are the sportsman, you may 
find employment there working as a tour guide or a hunter. Though, of course, 
there's the possibility they'll still stick you with routine miner maintenance."

Convergence of tracks.
Vehicular tracks of different sizes appear from all directions to unite in a 
single stream leading westwards. The unstable white dunes give way to a solid, 
sun-baked road of compacted earth, cracked and beaten by exposure to the 
weather. Freshly dug, continuous furrows in the sand on either side of the 
established route indicate efforts to keep it from being submerged beneath the 
shifting ivory sea. Beyond, rectangular silhouettes of the many buildings of a 
sprawling compound rise up through the swirling sands.

A ghostly dune sea.
Smattering threads of particles a richer, more pure white than the surrounding 
sands streak the blanched landscape. An area of dimpled dunes and low peaks 
forms a colourless ocean, lurching waves frozen in geography. Pockmarks that 
could be footprints punch holes here and there in the uneasy surface of the sand
hills, the lone trace of humanity other than the fragments of tracks left by 
sand-crawlers, their repeating patterns largely obliterated by the wind's 
obfuscating breath.

A natural sinkhole.
This natural depression in the sands, about six metres deep, leads down to a 
bowl of shifting sand that vaguely represents the upper half of an hourglass, 
with a dimple in the centre into which grains of white sand slip so slowly as to
be almost imperceptible.

Desiccated forest remnants.
At the western periphery of this area can be seen a forlorn arrangement of 
perished jungle flora, their scorched stumps and thick truncated stalks already 
being reclaimed by the earth. Even dead and ravaged, the former biodiversity of 
the thick forest is readily evident in the vast array of shapes and textures 
represented. Most of the sand here is brown from filtering, with only a few 
light patches remaining around the jungle remains. A sun-dried liana vine snakes
away from one of the larger stumps like the power cord of a broken machine.

A cliffside view of a settlement.
Brown sand gives away to tawny rock that falls away here in a long, high crag. A
few gnarled, half-denuded trees, their roots burrowing and gripping, still cling
tenaciously to life on the rock wall. At the base of the cliff a small 
settlement is visible; though distance makes details difficult to differentiate,
signs of motion point decisively to habitation. The tops of sandminers and what 
might be a cluster of refineries can just be made out.

ravine with high sides of faded, eroding auburn rock. The formation's floor is 
littered with detritus: sun-dried jungle vines, rocks, cast-off sand-miner

A crumbling roadway.
A navigable roadway follows the course of the ravines west and southeast, but 
here at the junction of sands it is falling swiftly to ruin.  The dusty surface 
of the road is badly cracked in places as if by seismic upheaval or the pressure
of heavy weight, rendering it impassable to most vehicles.  Rocky nuggets of 
crumbled surfacing line the sides of the path.  Every so often larger blocks 
have been separated from the whole, rent with great force and carved with what 
appear to be giant toothmarks.  An undeveloped gorge slopes up toward the 
southern desert.

The bleached bones of a colossal animal have been shredded to shards here, 
scattered around the spent brown sands. The destruction of such a magnificent 
specimen was evidently not achieved without cost: about the remains are littered
dozens of bent and broken metal teeth, worn smooth now by the passage of time. 
Only the skull, staggering in its size, has remained intact. With blunt teeth

arcs at the foot of the cliffs, a dizzying and dangerous distance below. The air

An angled slope.
The otherwise vertical edges of the raised southern desert give way here to a 
less dramatic drop-off, an angle of perhaps seventy-five degrees, at the bending
of the plateau. Too steep to allow passage or to seriously forestall death from 
falling, the slackening of angle does provide a fine course for blown sand and 
the occasional cascade of pebbles. A modest road, dust-coloured, winds around

Half submerged in swirling sand is the frame of a small desert-going vehicle, 
badly rusted and abraded by the elements. The wheels and all practical 
components have been stripped away and scavenged, leaving only the dented, 
unwieldy blue durasteel chassis behind to decay. The calm, level sands nearby

Treaded tracks in the deep desert.
Twinned sets of deep tracks, metres apart and kilometres long, lead off to 
destinations unknown. The small ridges of sand, spaced evenly within the tracks'
depressions, reveal the path of a very large treaded vehicle. Even in the fickle
winds and obscuring sand of the far desert, many of the tracks have retained 
something of their original shape and depth, though whether through recent 
passage or the pressure of great weight is unclear.

Thick brown waste-sand has been formed by wind, artifice or both into strikingly

In the shadow of a gargantuan sand miner.
A monolithic, rectangular sand miner overshadows this portion of the desert, 
bearing a flamboyant, stylized sun logo on either side that has been gradually 
eaten away by rust. The huge, flat, steel teeth on the front of the sand miner 
are dug into the sand, evidently responsible for the long, shallow trenches in 
the white sand.

A ghostly dune sea.
Smattering threads of particles a richer, more pure white than the surrounding 
sands streak the blanched landscape. An area of dimpled dunes and low peaks 
forms a colourless ocean, lurching waves frozen in geography. Pockmarks that 
could be footprints punch holes here and there in the uneasy surface of the sand
hills, the lone trace of humanity other than the fragments of tracks left by

Convergence of tracks.
Vehicular tracks of different sizes appear from all directions to unite in a 
single stream leading westwards. The unstable white dunes give way to a solid, 
sun-baked road of compacted earth, cracked and beaten by exposure to the 
weather. Freshly dug, continuous furrows in the sand on either side of the 
established route indicate efforts to keep it from being submerged beneath the 
shifting ivory sea. Beyond, rectangular silhouettes of the many buildings of a

The base of a white cliff.
Following a lurching pattern, the rounded dunes curve up and down, disappearing 
into the flat, pallid earth before ballooning up again, like the sinuous back of
a great, sabulous sea serpent. A low but impressive sandstone cliff to the west 
hangs over the desert, cleaving through the sandy expanse and barring further 
passage. Surface scoured away by a persistent wind, the compacted strata of the 
pale, sedimentary rock are exposed, their private patterns bared to the world.

Ivory sands.
A flowing expanse of dunes blankets the landscape, frozen in the lurching, 
roiling motions of tempest-tossed waves in a vast, albescent sea. The abundance 
of crushed minerals comprising the sand are of an achromatic hue, closer to 
silver than beige. One hill stands out among its bald companions, stubbled with 
fine wooden splinters, their presence unexplained in this parched, barren 
environment. Patiently terraforming the surroundings, a blustering wind rolls 
ever past, occasionally bringing with it the growls of distant machinery.

Interweaving trails in the sand.
Continuous tessellating impressions stamp their way across the desert's pale 
canvas, their dimensions mechanically precise. Wiping the slate clean, the broad
treads of a sand miner lie at the bottom of the tangle, twin trails spaced many 
feet apart. Swerving from side to side in a vague helical array, the lines of a 
a small, four-wheeled vehicle weave between the miner's tracks, more detailed 
where they cross patches of compacted sand. Indistinct footprints venture here 
and there, and forming the topmost layer, the tightly spaced trail of a small 
quadruped speckles the flattened dunes.

A shallow valley of white sand.
Dumpy dunes of pale white mound up on every side, forming a shallow valley just 
deep enough to inhibit view of the geography beyond. Eddies of wind lazily 
animate swirls of alabaster grains atop the crests of the sandy hills, curling 
experimentally through the air for mere moments before disintegrating. The 
throaty roar of mining equipment sounds out from over a western peak, 
uncomfortably close and distractingly loud. The only view is that of the sky 
above, vast and open, its myriad possibilities beckoning but unreachable from 
this lowly terrestrial rut.

Long white dunes.
Moulded into limber stretches by the wind, the rich ivory hills elegantly 
unfurl, from a distance appearing marmoreal and perfect. The play of light 
highlights dark wrinkles where the dunes fold into one another, the lines soft 
and shadows gentle. Closer view reveals subtle ripples rasped into the sand by 
the elements, occasional pockmarks of pebbles and animal tracks freckling the 
pale alabaster. Examining closer still, the individual grains of the sand tell 
of a porous, malleable surface, overwhelmingly pearly white but scattered with 
traces of granular minerals, specks of wood, and other minute organic fragments.

Heavy trails of treads.
Deep grooves and shallower impressions in the sand form a stream of past 
vehicular passage. The telling trails funnel up a shallow incline towards a 
beckoning building in the western mining complex, where a broad, dark opening 
into a distant hangar offers an oasis amid the parching sands. Heaped to the 
side by regular traffic, mounds of white form ditches bordering the unsurfaced 
roadway, the convex centre of the arterial lane of travel accentuated by the 
steady declination of either side. Wisping breaths of white streak through the 
air here and there, just above the ground, where flurries of grains are 
momentarily swept up by swirling, short-lived zephyrs.

The top of a steep sandstone hill.
This spot provides an expansive vista of the northern desert. A paved road makes
switchbacks along the steep, stratified hillside below, finally making a 
junction among the dunes before climbing back up a smaller hill in the distance,
on which a small white mining station has been built. A large white complex with
plaster walls looms to the south, some cracks in the plaster revealing thick, 
dark glass that has been reinforced with metal bars. Large black metal doors

The northern face of this sandstone hill is steep, forcing the paved road to

along both sides of the road, and signs have been planted every few dozen 
meters, warning vehicles to maintain a safe speed. This spot lends a view of the
northern sands as well, among which another, smaller hill sits, topped with a 
white mining station. Atop this hill, a large white complex has been installed

Continuous tessellating impressions stamp their way across the desert's pale 
canvas, their dimensions mechanically precise. Wiping the slate clean, the broad
treads of a sand miner lie at the bottom of the tangle, twin trails spaced many 
feet apart. Swerving from side to side in a vague helical array, the lines of a 
a small, four-wheeled vehicle weave between the miner's tracks, more detailed 
where they cross patches of compacted sand. Indistinct footprints venture here 
and there, and forming the topmost layer, the tightly spaced trail of a small 
quadruped speckles the flattened dunes.

A shallow valley of white sand.
Dumpy dunes of pale white mound up on every side, forming a shallow valley just 
deep enough to inhibit view of the geography beyond. Eddies of wind lazily 
animate swirls of alabaster grains atop the crests of the sandy hills, curling 
experimentally through the air for mere moments before disintegrating. The 
throaty roar of mining equipment sounds out from over a western peak, 
uncomfortably close and distractingly loud. The only view is that of the sky 
above, vast and open, its myriad possibilities beckoning but unreachable from 
this lowly terrestrial rut.

Long white dunes.
Moulded into limber stretches by the wind, the rich ivory hills elegantly 
unfurl, from a distance appearing marmoreal and perfect. The play of light 
highlights dark wrinkles where the dunes fold into one another, the lines soft 
and shadows gentle. Closer view reveals subtle ripples rasped into the sand by 
the elements, occasional pockmarks of pebbles and animal tracks freckling the 
pale alabaster. Examining closer still, the individual grains of the sand tell 
of a porous, malleable surface, overwhelmingly pearly white but scattered with 
traces of granular minerals, specks of wood, and other minute organic fragments.

Rock-studded dunes.
Great sandstone boulders litter the landscape, toppled from the overhanging 
western cliffs. Gouging ruts in the sand lead up to gaps where many rocky 
impediments have been dragged away, but many still remain, too dense an 
impediment to permit further passage of large vehicles. Numerous stippled 
patterns of small, quadrupedal footprints mark the sand, disappearing into the 
ample small holes and crevices provided by the immense rocks. In other 
directions, the jagged, pebbledashed ground gives way to the vanilla curves of a
great dune sea.

Heavy trails of treads.
Deep grooves and shallower impressions in the sand form a stream of past 
vehicular passage. The telling trails funnel up a shallow incline towards a 
beckoning building in the western mining complex, where a broad, dark opening 
into a distant hangar offers an oasis amid the parching sands. Heaped to the 
side by regular traffic, mounds of white form ditches bordering the unsurfaced 
roadway, the convex centre of the arterial lane of travel accentuated by the 
steady declination of either side. Wisping breaths of white streak through the 
air here and there, just above the ground, where flurries of grains are 
momentarily swept up by swirling, short-lived zephyrs.

Half-buried in the chalk-white dunes, the tormented angles of a mangled tree 
stump lurch from the smooth sand like an enormous burr. Its dead roots partially
wrenched from the ground, the end of the desiccated trunk is jaggedly torn away,
the splintering point of amputation surrounded by a flurry of blade impressions 
at precise, mechanical intervals. Its circumference telling of a once-towering 
organic monolith, the wooden remnant is now sorely out of place in the ghostly,

The centre of a mining operation.
The interior of the desert complex is kept tidy almost to excess. A small stack 
of crates is piled neatly in the corner of the room on a spotless tile floor. 
There are no windows or decorations, but a floodlight in every corner of the 
room keeps it well illuminated. The room stretches to the southeast, where 
vehicles and more crates have been stored. Two cutaways in the western and 
eastern walls lead to wings of the complex, one labelled "Operations," the 
other, "Guard Tower," respectively.

Approaching a white complex.
A large building has been built out here among the dunes, bearing the same 
colour as the surrounding sand. The complex has been covered in white plaster 
that cracks in places to reveal dark, reinforced glass. The building is 
completely devoid of windows, though a tall watchtower has been built on the 
eastern side. Machine gun turrets have been installed on all sides of the tower,
and there are even several barrels poking out of small slots in the walls of the
tower at the second storey. A low hall has been built on the opposite side. The 
road leads to wide gates of wrought iron which are swung open

On a rise near a desert complex.
The road reaches the crest of the hill here, providing an expansive view of the 
desert to the south. The road winds down the hill to the southwest, then on to 
an intersection, beyond which a temporary mining operation has been set up, 
where tiny tents composing a mining camp dot the sands next to a modest mining 
field. Two lumbering dark machines stand amid dark piles of sand in the middle 
of the field. Aside from these shards of civilization, the white sands stretch 
on to the southern horizon. A large white complex stands to the north, its 
construction strictly angular against the organic form of the dunes that 
surround the hill. A tower with mounted weaponry has been built on one side, a 
long, low hall on the other.

Near the crest of a sandstone hill.
The paved road lined with chunks of rock and withered shrubbery switchbacks near
the top of the sandstone hill. At the top, a white complex can be seen, guarded 
by a tall white tower with large weapon installations on every side. The 
building's construction is strictly rectangular, contrasting against the organic
flow of the hillside and surrounding dunes. To the south, tiny tents and dark 
machines can barely be seen poking above the dunes.

On a road climbing a sandstone hill.
From this vantage point, the desert starts to come into a larger perspective. A 
four-way intersection to the south is clearly visible, beyond which the tops of 
dark tents pop out from among the white dunes. The layers upon layers in the 
sandstone record a time long before this road was ever carved into it. The far 
side of the road has been lined with chunks of sandstone and planted with 
withering shrubbery to prevent erosion.

The dunes come up against a striped hill of sandstone that looms to the north, 
steep enough to make the road take loose switchbacks as it continues uphill to a
large white complex at the top. To the south, the road loses itself among the 
white dunes until it reappears in the distance at a four-way intersection.

Near a desert intersection.
The paved road winds like a river of civilization through the otherwise barren 
dunes. A large intersection has been built to the south, with roads branching 
off in three other directions. Tall dunes have built up beside the road, 
partially sheltering it from the sun. Above the dunes to the north, a hill rises
out of the sand and is crowned on top with a large white compound.

A desert intersection.
The paved road branches off here, leading in four separate directions. The road 
dips to the southwest before rising up above the dunes. Three roads lead in a 
northern direction, each making its own way through the sands to an unseen 
destination. Small piles of sand lie strewn about the intersection, cast from 
the dunes by the wind.

Sloped dunes.
The road here reaches a crest in the sand that continues relatively level

down northeast towards the sea, flanked by tall colourful indigo and orange 
flags that are topped with a cluster of five stars that are joined tip to tip.

Approaching the beach.
This sloped road draws the line between the sparkling blue ocean that stretches 
to the eastern horizon and the more figurative ocean of white sand that 
stretches west. The road continues northeast and southwest towards these two 
extremes. On either side of the road are vertical banners coloured peach and 
burgundy and topped with a cluster of five stars.

Where the dunes meet the sea.
The deep blue ocean water washes up on the almost perfectly smooth beach like an
eraser constantly rubbing a slate clean. Just out of reach of the water, a paved
road stretches north along the beach. The road also heads west, up the gently 
sloped shore, inland towards a dry sea of shimmering white sand.

A road along the beach.
A sparkling deep blue sea is spread out to the east, bordered by a beach of soft
sand that is even whiter than the dunes that rise to the west. Tall golden and

silver poles, each of which is topped with a cluster of five stars.

Upon this rise towards the northern cliff and down to the southern beach, a 
small cove is spread out below to the northeast, in which a bizarre rock 
formation mimicking a primitive monolith stands boldly in the centre. Just past

A desert intersection atop a cliff.
The windblown sands have been swept clear of this meticulously maintained paved 
road. Low barriers on either side of the road keep most of the sands at bay. The
main road stretches directly north and south, but another road branches west

The crest of a tall dune.
Steady slope rising to an impressive peak, like a toppled berg in a parched 
white sea, a towering dune provides a point of vantage over the surrounding 
desert. The radiant sand is heaped in a crescent-shaped wedge, the great pile 
ever added to by a gritty, blustering wind, which steadily sheds snow-white 
granules as it futilely strains to topple the sand hill. Visible from the 
summit, furrowed expanses of achromatic sand fill a wide panorama. The dark 
forms of voracious, box-shaped mining vehicles slowly and methodically prowl the
dune sea, appearing the size of children's toys from this distance. Hints of a 
great ocean to the east underscore the horizon, while the blocky buildings of a 
mining complex bulge like sores in the western desert.

Outside a glass lobby.
An array of vertical banners of practically every imaginable hue is set outside 
a building composed primarily of golden glass and dark thin beams. A set of 
double doors in the building is made not of wood or glass, but of a cascade of 
jets of cool, sparkling water from robotic arms that hang from the top rail. 
Tall palm trees, totally alien to the environment, have been planted all around 
the building. A sign above the door bears an image of five stars joined into a 
ring with the words "Welcome to Paradise!" scrawled casually yet professionally 
over it.

The main lobby of the resort.
Double doors that are composed not of any solid material but of a thin cascade 
of cool, clear water open from the south into this large lobby which is built 
with golden glass which has been reinforced by a skeleton of narrow metal beams.
The light that filters in through the glass drenches everything in an amber 
light. The shape of the ceiling is arched with the peak running north to the 
other end of the building. Powerful jets of cool water on the east side of the 
building have been installed next to the wall and shoot up, along the ceiling, 
and back down the opposite wall.

Rippled glass doors open into this dining hall, which features a full buffet 
line, including a marble salad bar, an automated deli, and a huge refrigerator 
stocked with every fruit imaginable. Beyond the buffet area, seats and tables

The crest of a tall dune.
Steady slope rising to an impressive peak, like a toppled berg in a parched 
white sea, a towering dune provides a point of vantage over the surrounding 
desert. The radiant sand is heaped in a crescent-shaped wedge, the great pile 
ever added to by a gritty, blustering wind, which steadily sheds snow-white 
granules as it futilely strains to topple the sand hill. Visible from the 
summit, furrowed expanses of achromatic sand fill a wide panorama. The dark 
forms of voracious, box-shaped mining vehicles slowly and methodically prowl the
dune sea, appearing the size of children's toys from this distance. Hints of a 
great ocean to the east underscore the horizon, while the blocky buildings of a 
mining complex bulge like sores in the western desert.

A seaside patio.
Built out from the main resort, which lies to the west along the beach, this 
dark wooden patio has been built out over the sparkling ocean. Round glass 
tables with azure umbrellas are scattered around with fur-covered chairs around 
them. Wide glass double doors lead back into the resort, which from this angle 
looks remarkably similar to a greenhouse. The coastline disappears to the

sheltered cove in that direction.

A navigable roadway follows the course of the ravines west and southeast, but 
here at the junction of sands it is falling swiftly to ruin.  The dusty surface 
of the road is badly cracked in places as if by seismic upheaval or the pressure
of heavy weight, rendering it impassable to most vehicles.  Rocky nuggets of 
crumbled surfacing line the sides of the path.  Every so often larger blocks 
have been separated from the whole, rent with great force and carved with what 
appear to be giant toothmarks.  An undeveloped gorge slopes up toward the 
southern desert.

to work for us? I suppose I might as well explain a little about myself and this
facility."

Tiago the Chief Scientist says, "I'm the Head Scientist. This facility is 
dedicated to running experiments on the fascinating geology on this planet. 
Ideally, we'd like to synthesize the zytin, but realistically, I think we were 
just put here to harvest what's already here."
1301/1301H 1301/1301M - 
Tiago the Chief Scientist says, "Well, as long as we keep shipping the stuff 
back to the Empire, they let us run whatever experiments we want. Right now, 
we're working around the clock to try to find a solution to the chemical leaks 
we've caused. Perhaps later you'll be able to help us with that."

Entrance to a research facility.
This solid white tunnel has blue-tinted sliding glass doors on either side and a
long, sand-covered blue tacky mat on the ground. The doors to the south lead out
to the desert, where colourful swirls of chemical spills are visible on the flat
wasteland. The doors to the north open into a short, solid white hallway with

To the north, a giant silver hemisphere has been stuck in the ground with the 
flat side facing east. A black, bowl-shaped solar array of the same size is 
swivelled towards the sky. A tunnel projects from the southern base of the 
hemisphere. Blue-tinted sliding glass doors allow entrance inside the building. 
The road runs in a straight line northwest and southeast through land that, 
though relatively flat, is painted with many colours due to the high 
concentration of minerals and chemicals in the sand.

Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the 
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines, 
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of 
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny 
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into 
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the 
clouds.

The white marble walkway, shot through with azure veins, runs straight east and 
west, where it widens in a gradual outward curve to meet the outer ring of the 
garden. Tall walls of immaculate white stone direct the walkway, following both 
the straight edges and curves. Carved within the walls, visible beneath thick 
tendrils of vegetation that spill over the top, are carved symmetrical patterns 
of complex spirals and curved bands, highlighted by the occasional sharp angle.

blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves. 
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the

In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.
