Soft, blue light fills the room from an unseen overhead source, covering the 
floor entirely. The room is octagonal in shape, and alternating identical walls 
contain built in fluorescent lights that are covered by a semi-translucent panel
built into the wall. The light from the two metres tall panels blends with the 
above blue light, creating a cool colour that floats and shifts as it reflects 
off of a slight haze that gently seeps up from the floor below, lingering only a
metre or so off the white tiles. A lone portal is the sole exit out of this 
room, perfectly centred. It is thin, and stands unsupported, allowing complete 
access around it. The portal's plasma surface constantly swirls and shifts 
between shades of violets and blues to a solid mirror-like reflective surface.

Waterfall at the centre of the garden.
Marbled white stones, shot through with whorls of azure, describe a circular 
path around the translucent waterfall in the centre of the gardens. A short dais
encloses the waterfall, rising two shallow steps above the floor. Tall walls of 
a pure white stone, sharp corners all pointing toward the waterfall, buttress 
the centre ring, bordering and delineating four distinct walks. Sprouting in 
controlled masses from the tops of those walls are cascades of vines and wide, 
flat leaves of a deep, dark green. Hidden behind the verdant tendrils, carved 
into the face of the pristine white rock, are intricate patterns of interlocking
curves and and sharp angles. High above the whorled white marble, beyond the 
clouds masking the waterfall's ascent, is visible a smattering of browns and 
reds, and far to the northeast, gold.
A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for safety. 
Strutting back and forth in quiet contemplation, the Babyl Overseer presides 
here. A group of five small pills marked with a nerve lie here. A group of four 
small pills marked with a nerve lie here. The corpse of Japhis lies here. A thin
layer of shed skin lies by the battered remains of a garden snake. A slimy pile 
of goo and fuzz is all that remains of a caterpillar.
Acolyte of Flame Japhis is here. Mildena is here.

West of a waterfall.
Overflowing the wall, reaching nearly the blue-veined white marble of the 
walkway, are thick vines upon which grow flat, green leaves. Beneath the vines, 
in high walls of a pure white stone, is carved an expansive, complex pattern of 
curves and angles, coming together and crossing in spirals and knots of uncanny 
variety and depth. The walkway runs straight west and east; there it opens into 
a clearing in which is a large waterfall, its waters cascading upward into the 
clouds.
Two green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for 
safety.

Western garden path.
The white marble walkway, shot through with azure veins, runs straight east and 
west, where it widens in a gradual outward curve to meet the outer ring of the 
garden. Tall walls of immaculate white stone direct the walkway, following both 
the straight edges and curves. Carved within the walls, visible beneath thick 
tendrils of vegetation that spill over the top, are carved symmetrical patterns 
of complex spirals and curved bands, highlighted by the occasional sharp angle.

Western edge of a garden.
The marble walkway from the west intersects with the wide outer ring, the 
blue-veined stone blending seamlessly as the mouth of the walkway widens in a 
smooth curve. Geometrical patterns of spirals and complex knots are carved into 
the high white walls that border the walkways, following the inner edges as they
run east to both the north and south. The western edge of the outer ring is 
girded only by the horizon, clouds in all directions. Flowing down the face of 
the walls is a sheet of thick vines, each sprouting several wide, flat leaves. 
Far above the garden can be seen smudges of brown to the south and red to the 
north.
A green worm squirms around in the dirt, attempting to bury itself for safety. A

A path around an elevated garden.
In the centre of the curved southeastern wall, amid the complex geometrical 
patterns of curved lines and sharp angles, is carved a relief of Izarin Jezira, 
his arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome, his bold Elaran features captured
in uncanny detail. The heavy tendrils of thick vines and broad leaves have been 
meticulously removed from the relief, the open shape vaguely rectangular; a 
stark square of immaculate white among the green. The walkway itself, a gently 
curving ring around the garden, is made of a white marble, shot through with 
veins of light blue. To the northwest, opposite the wall, is only sky; high 
above the garden, through the veil of clouds, can be seen a heavy smudge of red.
Four green worms squirm around in the dirt, attempting to bury themselves for 
safety. A garden snake slithers along the ground, attempting to hide itself 
under the fallen leaves.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand.

At this edge of the landing platform, a low metal ramp has been installed from

of the platform. A communication console has been installed to the south.

for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way

In the shadow of a giant sand miner.
Towering many times higher than the dunes, a massive, rusted, box-shaped sand 
miner is here, its teeth dug into the sandstone bedrock. Its wide treads are 
just slightly taller than the average human. A mountain of sand, looking 
slightly duller than the surrounding dunes, is piled off to the side. Smaller 
piles of sandstone litter the area.
The Chief Engineer stands here, obviously preoccupied with the huge sand miner.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way

the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community

On two sides, the huge treaded sand miners overshadow the mining field, a barren

Corner of a sand mining field.
The devastation of the sands comes to an abrupt end here as the dunes overtake

Near a giant sand miner.
Towards the centre of the mining field, piles of dark sand and decomposing 
sandstone block vision of most of the white dunes that surround the field. Just

even the largest dunes look insignificant in comparison.

Edge of a sand mining field.
Slightly eroded tread marks bite deep into the exposed sandstone as though a 
vehicle of immense mass has passed through here and completely cleared the area

By an exposed stump.
Here, where the exposed sandstone meets natural dunes, an uncovered stump pokes 
from the sand. The bark that hasn't been scoured from the stump looks rough and 
scaly. Small wormholes riddle the now-dead wood, and pale fungus has started to 
take hold on the stump. All around, sand appears to have been dug up and spit 
back out in large quantities. Distant mining machines stand tall above their 
by-product.

From this vantage point, most of the mining field can be seen as well as a great
vista of the desert and a dark paved road that winds through it to the

dunes, discoloured to almost a brown hue. To the south, huge, dark machines 
provide a stark contrast to the white dunes, leaving exposed, crumbling bedrock

In the shadow of a giant sand miner.
Towering many times higher than the dunes, a massive, rusted, box-shaped sand 
miner is here, its teeth dug into the sandstone bedrock. Its wide treads are 
just slightly taller than the average human. A mountain of sand, looking 
slightly duller than the surrounding dunes, is piled off to the side. Smaller 
piles of sandstone litter the area.
The Chief Engineer stands here, obviously preoccupied with the huge sand miner.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand.

off the ground. On either side of the ramp, a railing runs around the perimeter 
of the platform. A communication console has been installed to the south. 
Flickering landing lights encircle the safe landing zone to the west. To the 
north, another ramp leads down to an earthen trail that leads to two monumental 
crates that stretch about as long as this platform.

Corner of a mining field.
The sand has been utterly cleared from this spot, exposing the sandstone layer 
beneath the dunes. Wide tread marks sink into the soft stone. Out on the field, 
huge dark rectangular sand miners sit among piles of sand almost as dark. Beyond
them, the naturally white dunes are barely visible.

Near a giant sand miner.
Towards the centre of the mining field, piles of dark sand and decomposing 
sandstone block vision of most of the white dunes that surround the field. Just 
past a pile of rubble, a colossal treaded machine dominates the scene, making 
even the largest dunes look insignificant in comparison.
You see exits leading to the east, south, west and northwest.

Upon a mountain of sand.
From this vantage point, most of the surrounding mining field is visible. Piles 
of dull, discoloured sand and sandstone lie scattered randomly on the exposed, 
crumbling bedrock. Two huge, blocky sand mining machines stand like megaliths on
the barren field with teeth buried in the bedrock. Beyond the field, shining 
white sand stretches into the distance.

Atop a mountain of discoloured sand.
From this vantage point, most of the mining field can be seen as well as a great
vista of the desert and a dark paved road that winds through it to the 
northeast. The sand making up this large pile is darker than the surrounding 
dunes, discoloured to almost a brown hue. To the south, huge, dark machines 
provide a stark contrast to the white dunes, leaving exposed, crumbling bedrock 
in their wake.

The edge of a mining field.
Brown, discoloured sand has been piled on top of the clean, white sand and has 
started to spread like a disease into the desert. On the northwestern side of 
this heap are sweeping dunes. The other side has been stripped clean down to the
bedrock, which bears wide tread marks of extremely heavy machinery.
A large rat nest has been built here. The stiff corpse of a grease snake has

Upon a mountain of dull sand.
The edge of the mining field is a place of contrast. White dunes surround dark 
piles of processed sand. Crumbled sandstone has been crushed under the treads of
heavy machinery. Beyond the ravaged mining field, pristine white dunes stretch 
on to the horizon in every direction. On the northern and eastern horizon, a 
long strip of greenery contrasts starkly against the appearance of flat, 
inhospitable desert.

Between the sand miners.
On two sides, the huge treaded sand miners overshadow the mining field, a barren
expanse of sandstone with small mountains of brown, processed sand contrasting

Between the sand miners.
On two sides, the huge treaded sand miners overshadow the mining field, a barren
expanse of sandstone with small mountains of brown, processed sand contrasting 
darkly against more distant white dunes. Piles of sandstone have been scattered 
across the field and are already decomposing back into their original elements.

Near a giant sand miner.
Towards the centre of the mining field, piles of dark sand and decomposing 
sandstone block vision of most of the white dunes that surround the field. Just 
past a pile of rubble, a colossal treaded machine dominates the scene, making 
even the largest dunes look insignificant in comparison.
You see exits leading to the east, south, west and northwest.

Corner of a mining field.
The sand has been utterly cleared from this spot, exposing the sandstone layer 
beneath the dunes. Wide tread marks sink into the soft stone. Out on the field, 
huge dark rectangular sand miners sit among piles of sand almost as dark. Beyond
them, the naturally white dunes are barely visible.

Near a giant sand miner.
A long strip of bedrock has been exposed here with giant trenches gouged out of 
it. Huge tread marks roughly ten feet wide lead towards a huge sand mining 
machine further towards the centre of the field. Huge mounds of discoloured sand
have been piled unnaturally high to the side.

Entrance to a sand mining field.
Piles of sandstone lie cast aside here, catching sand on their windward side and
developing their own dunes. To the west, long shallow trenches have been carved 
out of exposed bedrock, which is covered by wide tread marks. Further in the 
distance, huge, dark, rectangular machines stand out against the white sands.
The corpse of Oronar lies here. The corpse of Seuter lies here.

Near a sand mining field.
The tents are fairly sparse here, giving way to an expansive mining operation. 
To the west, the sandstone bedrock under the dunes has been scraped clean, dark 
piles of processed sand blown unceremoniously to the side. Two rusted, 
rectangular machines stand out on the field of sandstone.
You see exits leading to the east and west.

Centre of private mining camp.
Amid a cluster of tents, two especially stand out. A long black pavilion has 
been set up to the east, providing shelter for cargo and crew. The other has 
been set up to the northeast and labelled in white letters on the black material
that read, "Headquarters." Beside it, the packed earth gives way to a paved road
that snakes out to the north.

The outskirts of a private mining camp.
Most of the trash from the camp has accumulated on the outskirts. An 
air-conditioned outhouse is stationed just outside the cluster of tents. Litter 
ranging from paper scraps to broken bits of machinery have been tossed aside 
here, out of the way of the normal flow of traffic. To the east, a large tent 
smelling faintly of decaying food houses the mess hall.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand.

At this edge of the landing platform, a low metal ramp has been installed from 
the trail of packed earth below, up to the platform, which stands about a metre 
off the ground. On either side of the ramp, a railing runs around the perimeter 
of the platform. A communication console has been installed to the south. 
Flickering landing lights encircle the safe landing zone to the west. To the 
north, another ramp leads down to an earthen trail that leads to two monumental 
crates that stretch about as long as this platform.

Centre of a large landing pad.
Charred blast marks mar the surface of this landing platform. A ring of landing 
lights flickers erratically around the safe landing zone. Crates lie piled 
around the main pad, waiting for freighters to collect them. The platform is 
slightly raised above the dunes, allowing a clear view of the surroundings. To

North edge of a landing pad.
Most of the crates that litter the landing pad have been kept clear of this side
of the landing pad. Two enormous crates the length of the landing pad lie in the

The tents are fairly sparse here, giving way to an expansive mining operation. 
To the west, the sandstone bedrock under the dunes has been scraped clean, dark 
piles of processed sand blown unceremoniously to the side. Two rusted,

Towering many times higher than the dunes, a massive, rusted, box-shaped sand 
miner is here, its teeth dug into the sandstone bedrock. Its wide treads are 
just slightly taller than the average human. A mountain of sand, looking 
slightly duller than the surrounding dunes, is piled off to the side. Smaller 
piles of sandstone litter the area.

In the shadow of a giant sand miner.
Towering many times higher than the dunes, a massive, rusted, box-shaped sand 
miner is here, its teeth dug into the sandstone bedrock. Its wide treads are 
just slightly taller than the average human. A mountain of sand, looking 
slightly duller than the surrounding dunes, is piled off to the side. Smaller 
piles of sandstone litter the area.
The Chief Engineer stands here, obviously preoccupied with the huge sand miner.
There is a single exit here to the east.

The edge of a mining field.
Brown, discoloured sand has been piled on top of the clean, white sand and has 
started to spread like a disease into the desert. On the northwestern side of 
this heap are sweeping dunes. The other side has been stripped clean down to the
bedrock, which bears wide tread marks of extremely heavy machinery.

dunes, discoloured to almost a brown hue. To the south, huge, dark machines 
provide a stark contrast to the white dunes, leaving exposed, crumbling bedrock

Slightly eroded tread marks bite deep into the exposed sandstone as though a

Here, where the exposed sandstone meets natural dunes, an uncovered stump pokes 
from the sand. The bark that hasn't been scoured from the stump looks rough and 
scaly. Small wormholes riddle the now-dead wood, and pale fungus has started to 
take hold on the stump. All around, sand appears to have been dug up and spit 
back out in large quantities. Distant mining machines stand tall above their

The entrance to a landing pad.
At this edge of the landing platform, a low metal ramp has been installed from 
the trail of packed earth below, up to the platform, which stands about a metre 
off the ground. On either side of the ramp, a railing runs around the perimeter 
of the platform. A communication console has been installed to the south. 
Flickering landing lights encircle the safe landing zone to the west. To the 
north, another ramp leads down to an earthen trail that leads to two monumental 
crates that stretch about as long as this platform.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand.

The outskirts of a private mining camp.
Most of the trash from the camp has accumulated on the outskirts. An 
air-conditioned outhouse is stationed just outside the cluster of tents. Litter 
ranging from paper scraps to broken bits of machinery have been tossed aside 
here, out of the way of the normal flow of traffic. To the east, a large tent

On two sides, the huge treaded sand miners overshadow the mining field, a barren

darkly against more distant white dunes. Piles of sandstone have been scattered

Near a giant sand miner.
A long strip of bedrock has been exposed here with giant trenches gouged out of 
it. Huge tread marks roughly ten feet wide lead towards a huge sand mining 
machine further towards the centre of the field. Huge mounds of discoloured sand
have been piled unnaturally high to the side.

Atop a mountain of discoloured sand.
From this vantage point, most of the mining field can be seen as well as a great
vista of the desert and a dark paved road that winds through it to the 
northeast. The sand making up this large pile is darker than the surrounding 
dunes, discoloured to almost a brown hue. To the south, huge, dark machines 
provide a stark contrast to the white dunes, leaving exposed, crumbling bedrock 
in their wake.

The edge of a mining field.
Brown, discoloured sand has been piled on top of the clean, white sand and has 
started to spread like a disease into the desert. On the northwestern side of 
this heap are sweeping dunes. The other side has been stripped clean down to the
bedrock, which bears wide tread marks of extremely heavy machinery.

Upon a mountain of sand.
From this vantage point, most of the surrounding mining field is visible. Piles 
of dull, discoloured sand and sandstone lie scattered randomly on the exposed, 
crumbling bedrock. Two huge, blocky sand mining machines stand like megaliths on
the barren field with teeth buried in the bedrock. Beyond the field, shining 
white sand stretches into the distance.

1142/1142H 1142/1142M - 
Upon a mountain of dull sand.
The edge of the mining field is a place of contrast. White dunes surround dark 
piles of processed sand. Crumbled sandstone has been crushed under the treads of
heavy machinery. Beyond the ravaged mining field, pristine white dunes stretch 
on to the horizon in every direction. On the northern and eastern horizon, a 
long strip of greenery contrasts starkly against the appearance of flat, 
inhospitable desert.
Two corpses of Oronar lie here haphazardly. The corpse of Seuter lies here. A

Atop a mound of discoloured sand.
The sand here has been discoloured to a dull brown, contrasting with the pure 
white sand just metres away. In the distance, huge, dark machines loom amid 
mounds of sand of the same colour. Beyond the polluted field, a distant sea of 
white sand is barely perceptible.

Corner of a sand mining field.
The devastation of the sands comes to an abrupt end here as the dunes overtake 
the scarred bedrock. Dark, towering sand miners loom in the distance, a stark 
contrast against the white dunes. A patch of packed earth is visible to the 
southwest where the sand hasn't quite covered it up.

Deep and wide tread marks have been cut out of the sandstone, moving off to the 
north. A large fossilized nautilus-like sea creature lies trapped in the sand 
between the two tread marks, a fragile reminder of an ancient era. To the south,
a virtually endless expanse of sand stretches on.

By an exposed stump.
Here, where the exposed sandstone meets natural dunes, an uncovered stump pokes 
from the sand. The bark that hasn't been scoured from the stump looks rough and 
scaly. Small wormholes riddle the now-dead wood, and pale fungus has started to 
take hold on the stump. All around, sand appears to have been dug up and spit 
back out in large quantities. Distant mining machines stand tall above their 
by-product.
The corpse of Nerto lies here. The oozing, crushed shell of an iridescent beetle
is here.
You see exits leading to the north, east and west.

Edge of a sand mining field.
Slightly eroded tread marks bite deep into the exposed sandstone as though a 
vehicle of immense mass has passed through here and completely cleared the area 
of sand. Small piles of the sandstone have been heaped up and have started to 
decay, returning to the individual grains of sand that they once were.

Near a giant sand miner.
Towards the centre of the mining field, piles of dark sand and decomposing 
sandstone block vision of most of the white dunes that surround the field. Just 
past a pile of rubble, a colossal treaded machine dominates the scene, making 
even the largest dunes look insignificant in comparison.

Corner of a mining field.
The sand has been utterly cleared from this spot, exposing the sandstone layer

huge dark rectangular sand miners sit among piles of sand almost as dark. Beyond
them, the naturally white dunes are barely visible.

piles of processed sand blown unceremoniously to the side. Two rusted,

Most of the trash from the camp has accumulated on the outskirts. An 
air-conditioned outhouse is stationed just outside the cluster of tents. Litter

pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way

In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand.

The outskirts of a private mining camp.
Most of the trash from the camp has accumulated on the outskirts. An 
air-conditioned outhouse is stationed just outside the cluster of tents. Litter 
ranging from paper scraps to broken bits of machinery have been tossed aside 
here, out of the way of the normal flow of traffic. To the east, a large tent 
smelling faintly of decaying food houses the mess hall.

A mining mess hall.
Inside the huge shabby pavilion that houses the dining hall, three rows of long 
benches allow crewmembers to eat when they're not sleeping or working their

eastern end of the tent is the kitchen responsible for providing food to 
crewmembers at all times.

A temporary kitchen has been set up in the back of the dining tent, providing a 
relatively sanitary place for crewmembers who have been assigned to kitchen 
duty. The counter is propped up on unfolding legs, with a hole cut into it for 
the sink. A flap on the tent wall allows for quick and easy waste disposal.

Amid a cluster of tents, two especially stand out. A long black pavilion has 
been set up to the east, providing shelter for cargo and crew. The other has 
been set up to the northeast and labelled in white letters on the black material
that read, "Headquarters." Beside it, the packed earth gives way to a paved road

scaly. Small wormholes riddle the now-dead wood, and pale fungus has started to 
take hold on the stump. All around, sand appears to have been dug up and spit 
back out in large quantities. Distant mining machines stand tall above their

Towards the centre of the mining field, piles of dark sand and decomposing

Towering many times higher than the dunes, a massive, rusted, box-shaped sand

just slightly taller than the average human. A mountain of sand, looking 
slightly duller than the surrounding dunes, is piled off to the side. Smaller 
piles of sandstone litter the area.

A steel dagger carves a horizontal arc through the air as you swing at an 
iridescent beetle. Your weapon's momentum is arrested, finding enough purchase 
in an iridescent beetle's torso for a devastating blow.
The force of your swing overpowers an iridescent beetle, a steel dagger lodging 
itself firmly in him. Blood seeps out of the wound around your weapon as an 
iridescent beetle's eyes roll back in his head. With a wet sucking sound, an 
iridescent beetle dislodges himself, falling to the ground in a heap.

Edge of a sand mining field.
Slightly eroded tread marks bite deep into the exposed sandstone as though a

By an exposed stump.
Here, where the exposed sandstone meets natural dunes, an uncovered stump pokes 
from the sand. The bark that hasn't been scoured from the stump looks rough and 
scaly. Small wormholes riddle the now-dead wood, and pale fungus has started to 
take hold on the stump. All around, sand appears to have been dug up and spit 
back out in large quantities. Distant mining machines stand tall above their 
by-product.

A loading ramp.
In this corner of the landing platform, the railing ends and the platform 
declines to meet the sand, which has been worn down by frequent traffic. Two 
enormous crates lie in the sand to the north, dark red ribbed monstrosities 
against the peaceful white dunes. The safe landing zone lies to the southwest, 
where flickering lights have been installed in an attempt to aid freighter 
pilots.

The entrance to a landing pad.
At this edge of the landing platform, a low metal ramp has been installed from 
the trail of packed earth below, up to the platform, which stands about a metre 
off the ground. On either side of the ramp, a railing runs around the perimeter 
of the platform. A communication console has been installed to the south. 
Flickering landing lights encircle the safe landing zone to the west. To the 
north, another ramp leads down to an earthen trail that leads to two monumental 
crates that stretch about as long as this platform.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand.
A tall greeting droid stands here. Two corpses of Allos lie here haphazardly.

Between the sand miners.
On two sides, the huge treaded sand miners overshadow the mining field, a barren

darkly against more distant white dunes. Piles of sandstone have been scattered

North edge of a landing pad.
Most of the crates that litter the landing pad have been kept clear of this side
of the landing pad. Two enormous crates the length of the landing pad lie in the
distance, their dark red colour a subtly startling variation from the white sand
dunes. The railing runs along here and ends to the east, where a path of packed 
earth branches off and leads to both crates.

declines to meet the sand, which has been worn down by frequent traffic. Two 
enormous crates lie in the sand to the north, dark red ribbed monstrosities 
against the peaceful white dunes. The safe landing zone lies to the southwest,

The entrance to a landing pad.
At this edge of the landing platform, a low metal ramp has been installed from 
the trail of packed earth below, up to the platform, which stands about a metre 
off the ground. On either side of the ramp, a railing runs around the perimeter 
of the platform. A communication console has been installed to the south. 
Flickering landing lights encircle the safe landing zone to the west. To the 
north, another ramp leads down to an earthen trail that leads to two monumental 
crates that stretch about as long as this platform.

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand. This area is badly burned.
A tall greeting droid stands here. Two corpses of Allos lie here haphazardly. 
Two corpses of Lyve lie here haphazardly. Two corpses of Krax lie here 
haphazardly. A fat sand rat has been exterminated and left to rot here. Two

Within a colossal crate.
Pitch black darkness clouds this area.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - e

The mouth of a colossal crate.
A beam of light streaming through the crack in the huge doors of this crate 
falls on a small pile of laminated blocks of some kind of mineral. The outside 
sunlight is quickly lost in this large box, and the walls of the crate continue 
on until they become lost in the darkness. The ridged floor of the crate has 
been lined with strips of tiny gravel bits embedded in tar, providing excellent 
traction.
You see exits leading to the south and west.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - s

Approaching a colossal crate.
A trail of packed earth leads on to a huge metal crate to the north that looms 
larger than a personal spacecraft. Rib-like protrusions jut from the sides of 
the crate. Between them, large stencilled olive letters read, "Galactic Shipping
Co." Two wide doors on one end have been left cracked open. The trail branches 
off to the east, where another similar crate can be seen in the distance.
You see exits leading to the north, east and south.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - s

A loading ramp.
In this corner of the landing platform, the railing ends and the platform 
declines to meet the sand, which has been worn down by frequent traffic. Two 
enormous crates lie in the sand to the north, dark red ribbed monstrosities 
against the peaceful white dunes. The safe landing zone lies to the southwest, 
where flickering lights have been installed in an attempt to aid freighter 
pilots.
You see exits leading to the north, northeast, south, southwest and west.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - w

North edge of a landing pad.
Most of the crates that litter the landing pad have been kept clear of this side
of the landing pad. Two enormous crates the length of the landing pad lie in the
distance, their dark red colour a subtly startling variation from the white sand
dunes. The railing runs along here and ends to the east, where a path of packed 
earth branches off and leads to both crates.
You see exits leading to the east, south and west.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - w

Northwest of a landing pad.
In this corner of the landing pad, crates are piled everywhere. The encroaching 
white sand swallows up the pad to the north and west, and then continues on like
waves in an endless, shifting sea. The railing has been broken here, apparently 
having been blown apart by some explosion.
You see exits leading to the east, southeast and south.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - s

Western edge of a landing pad.
While most of the crates have been piled on the western side of the landing pad 
to wait for freighters to collect them, a couple of crates lie on their sides, 
their contents spilled out on the ground. To the west, dunes stretch in an 
endless sea until they're lost on the horizon. A railing about two metres tall 
runs along the side of the platform.
You see exits leading to the north, east and south.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - e

Centre of a large landing pad.
Charred blast marks mar the surface of this landing platform. A ring of landing 
lights flickers erratically around the safe landing zone. Crates lie piled 
around the main pad, waiting for freighters to collect them. The platform is 
slightly raised above the dunes, allowing a clear view of the surroundings. To 
the east, past the edge of the platform, a trail leads away among the dunes. 
Dunes stretch on to the horizon to the south and west.
You see exits leading to the north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest
, west and northwest.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - s

South edge of a landing pad.
The southern edge of the landing pad is cluttered with crates and white 
laminated cubes that stand about knee-high. The metal railing runs along the 
side of the platform, but one of the laminated cubes has leaked off the side and
into the sand that lies about a metre below the platform.
You see exits leading to the north, east and west.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - e

Southeast corner of a landing pad.
This space has been cleared for a large brown console that has been installed 
for orbital communication. Large, dark yellow-stencilled letters on the side 
mark the console as a traffic control station. A railing runs behind the 
console, preventing anyone from falling off the edge of the platform. To the 
northwest, a wide landing zone is ringed with flickering guide lights.
An intellectual man absently makes notes on his tablet computer.

The entrance to a landing pad.
At this edge of the landing platform, a low metal ramp has been installed from 
the trail of packed earth below, up to the platform, which stands about a metre 
off the ground. On either side of the ramp, a railing runs around the perimeter 
of the platform. A communication console has been installed to the south. 
Flickering landing lights encircle the safe landing zone to the west. To the 
north, another ramp leads down to an earthen trail that leads to two monumental 
crates that stretch about as long as this platform.
You see exits leading to the north, east, south and west.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - e

A teleportation pad.
In the midst of the dunes is a raised dais of glistening white glass. A small 
terminal of flashing lights and buttons stands next to the dais. A large landing
pad is situated to the west among the featureless white dunes, providing a place
for freighters to land and load cargo. To the east, the sand suddenly gives way 
to air, dropping vertically down into a relatively placid sea. A road through 
the sand leads north towards the centre of the small, temporary mining community
that scratches its living out of the sand. This area is badly burned.
A tall greeting droid stands here. Two corpses of Allos lie here haphazardly. 
Three corpses of Lyve lie here haphazardly. Three corpses of Krax lie here 
haphazardly. A fat sand rat has been exterminated and left to rot here. Three 
corpses of Kirraxus lie here haphazardly. Two small pills marked with a nerve

The outskirts of a private mining camp.
Most of the trash from the camp has accumulated on the outskirts. An 
air-conditioned outhouse is stationed just outside the cluster of tents. Litter 
ranging from paper scraps to broken bits of machinery have been tossed aside 
here, out of the way of the normal flow of traffic. To the east, a large tent 
smelling faintly of decaying food houses the mess hall.
You see exits leading to the north, east and south.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - e

A mining mess hall.
Inside the huge shabby pavilion that houses the dining hall, three rows of long 
benches allow crewmembers to eat when they're not sleeping or working their 
shift. The sand has been left exposed under the tables for easy garbage 
disposal. Unidentifiable scraps lie partially buried under the sand. In the far 
eastern end of the tent is the kitchen responsible for providing food to 
crewmembers at all times.
You see exits leading to the east and west.
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - e

The miners' kitchen.
A temporary kitchen has been set up in the back of the dining tent, providing a 
relatively sanitary place for crewmembers who have been assigned to kitchen 
duty. The counter is propped up on unfolding legs, with a hole cut into it for 
the sink. A flap on the tent wall allows for quick and easy waste disposal.
A large mess cook goes about his duties. A large processor has been installed 
here. A large rat nest has been built here.
There is a single exit here to the west.

Centre of private mining camp.
Amid a cluster of tents, two especially stand out. A long black pavilion has 
been set up to the east, providing shelter for cargo and crew. The other has 
been set up to the northeast and labelled in white letters on the black material
that read, "Headquarters." Beside it, the packed earth gives way to a paved road
that snakes out to the north.

The mining headquarters tent.
Though the central tent is large, it is just as sparse as any of the other 
tents. A few cartographical tools lie scattered on a table in the centre of the 
tent. In the back of the tent, a thin brown veil sections off a small sleeping 
area equipped with a cot. The sand floor has been torched and turned to glass to
provide a better indoor surface.
Georg the Foreman stands here resolutely, eyeing the world disapprovingly.

The miners' lounge.
This section of the large tent is mostly empty, with the exception of the 
variety of crates doubling as furniture. Large crates serve as tables and 
smaller crates serve as seats for miners who are off-duty. The floor of the tent
leaves the sand exposed. A row of cheap metal bunks is set up in the back of the
tent.

Sleeping quarters.
In the back of the large, pavilion-like tent, an array of cheap bunks has been 
set up. Their thin frames hardly look strong enough to support a grown humanoid.
Piled around the bunks are more crates, some open and empty, others closed and 
sealed. The ground has been treated to provide a solid surface for the bunks.

A road in the desert.

A bend in the desert road.

southeast. All around, pristine white dunes rise up like waves waiting to crash 
down on careless passersby. Only the edges of the road are swallowed by the 
sands.

A rise along a desert road.
As the paved road rises to the top of one dune, a vista opens up of seemingly 
endless sands, dotted only rarely by the occasional stump. Towards the south, a 
small mining camp has been established. Giant craters have been dug out of the 
sand, exposing bedrock. Huge piles of sand have been swept aside. To the east, 
the desert suddenly drops off and gives way to an expansive, sparkling ocean.

Near an intersection.

blown back from the road, leaving it clear for travel. Nevertheless, the dunes 
overshadow the road like giant ocean waves. To the northeast, a large 
intersection can be seen.
Standing resolute, a huge armoured guard defends the area. Two corpses of

our company: the intellectual Jrec, the warmongering Ekat, and the opulent 
Leat."

Landon the Guard says, "The Jrec empire has established a presence to the 
northwest, where they perform experiments and study the planet. If you are 
interested in such things, find the clerk and GREET her to learn how to work for
them."
1221/1221H 1221/1221M -

control from the other empires. Their fortress lies along the road north of

military policeman for your first assignment with them."

northeast of here along the beach. If you GREET the receptionist there, he's

2.1 Aliases and Targets

What is an Alias?
-----------------
An alias is a way to set up a shorthand: something you type that stands for
something else. If you are always typing CREDITS FOR SALE, for example,
wouldn't it be easier to just type CFS? Yes, of course it would.
Here's how to do this:       SETALIAS cfs credits for sale
Every time you type cfs, Polaris will substitute CREDITS FOR SALE and issue
that command for you.


Let's say you try this:      SETALIAS sayhi say Hi everyone!
Now when you enter:          sayhi
Everyone will see you say:   Hi everyone!

Targets
-------
Targets are sort of like variables. Think of them as an alias within an alias,
if that helps! If not, read on. The examples should help. When you use a target
-- MORE --
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - more

in an alias, it must have a & at the beginning.
Let's fix up your alias 'sayhi' a bit. Now it'll say hi to your House leader,
whoever that may be. (Note the '&' sign below, which means &hl is a target.)
First set it up this way:   SETALIAS sayhi hi &hl
Then define hl:             SETTARGET hl Lyrathea
Now every time you do:      sayhi
Everyone will see you say:  Hi Lyrathea
Then if your house leader changes to, say, the new leader Aislin,
just change the target:     SETTARGET hl Aislin


Combat Targetting
-----------------
Let's say you want to use ml for maul. Here's how to accomplish this:
Set up the main alias:      SETALIAS ml maul &tar
Then define the target:     SETTARGET tar rat
Or change the target:       SETTARGET tar hyena
Every time you want to maul something else, just use a new SETTARGET to change

-- MORE --
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - more

the value of your target 'tar.'
Make all the aliases you want, and have them all use the same target for
targetting (like &tar, or whatever: just be consistent).
When you change to a new opponent, simply change the target
in this manner:            SETTARGET tar jackal


Limits on Aliases
-----------------
DON'T make alias names longer than 12 characters.
DON'T put spaces in aliases, though you can put numbers.
DON'T name an alias the same as the command you're replacing.
In other words, don't do this:  SETALIAS maul maul &tar
If you do this, 'maul' will not work at all!
But you can do this:            SETALIAS m1 maul &t1
And then:                       SETTARGET t1 rat



-- MORE --
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - more

Problems with Aliases
---------------------
Many problems can come from badly done aliases. If you find that a command just
stops working for you, check your aliaslist (AL). Maybe you set up 'eat' or
'smoke' as an alias, then later tried to use the regular command and it got all
messed up.


Advanced Aliases
----------------
There is one more thing about aliases that could be useful.
For setup, try this:         SETALIAS s2 say to
To use it, type this:        s2 juliet Salutations, honoured Juliet!
Which means you'll do this:  say to juliet Salutations, honoured Juliet!
Everything after the alias (in this case, everything after 's2') remains part
of your command. Think of the implications! In fact, that's your assignment,

-- MORE --
1221/1221H 1221/1221M - more

gentle reader. Think of all the lovely things you might do with that.

You can also set targets within in alias.  Do do this you would use:

SETALIAS m1 maul &tar=%1

Notice the extra '=%1' part, this says we want to set our target 'tar' to the
first word after m1.

You can use up to %5 in this way.

For example if you typed in m1 bob cat snake rat bird

%1 would be 'bob'
%2 would be 'cat'
%3 would be 'snake'
%4 would be 'rat'
%5 would be 'bird'
