Particles of dust swarm the room, blocking your sight. Weathered wooden beams 
form the entryway and stand as proud sentinels amidst the sand, a worn sign 
suspended between them. The words that once graced its surface have since faded 
into obscurity. A crumbling wall spreads out from the entrance to encircle the 
small outpost. Eyes blink in and out of existence, evidence that small animals 
have long since made homes within the rubble. A large blue golem stands here, 
its stony skin emitting a pale blue sheen. Scion of the Earthen Lord, Reyshak, 
Lochian Gatekeeper is here. He wields a tower shield in his right hand.

Particles of dust swarm the room, blocking your sight. Rubble lays strewn across
the floor here, making movement difficult but not impossible. Though low at the 
opening, the cave mouth broadens into a high vaulted ceiling. Scratches and 
markings line the walls in symmetrical patterns, making it obvious that this 
cave is man made. Carved into either side of the opening is the emblem of 
Bloodloch: a blindfolded female Consanguine, blood dripping from her bared 
fangs, holding a heavy tome in her left hand, and in her right a sharp sword 
pointed down towards the ground in an attempt to balance the power of the book 
and the sword. Like sharp teeth, a few stalagmites reach up from the ground 
here.
You see exits leading north, northeast, southeast and south.

A ring of dripstones extends from both the ceiling above and the floor below, 
like a vicious set of teeth. A large blue golem stands here, its stony skin 
emitting a pale blue sheen. Scion of the Earthen Lord, Reyshak, Lochian

in his right.
