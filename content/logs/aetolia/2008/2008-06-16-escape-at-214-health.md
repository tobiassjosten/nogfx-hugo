Prelatorian Highway north of Green Lake. (road). (Prelatorian Highway.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Green 
Lake is south of you as you pass along the highway. It is no more attractive 
than when you first glimpsed it, but serves as a food source for insects and the
birds and frogs which in turn feed upon them, so even it is valuable to the 
land, if repelling to the nose. Heralded by falling sand, a malformed dais 
stands nearby. An enormous golem composed of shale and onyx looms over its 
surroundings here. Episcopate Sanctus Augustinus is here, covered in silver fur.
Surrounded in an aura of defilement, Forest Prowler, Thuul Ta'sa is here, 
covered in black fur.
You see exits leading north, southeast, south and west.

Highway through the grasslands. (road). (Prelatorian Highway.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A 
luxuriant example of the richness of Aetolia and the continent of Sapience, the 
grasslands through which you are passing radiate vitality and strength. Even the
inroads made by grazing animals carrying riders or being herded along the road 
have not made any significant impact upon the fringes. The grasses grow thickly 
and one would be foolish to try to press through them when the highway runs 
smooth and clear instead. An enormous golem composed of shale and onyx looms 
over its surroundings here.
You see exits leading southeast and west.

Highway through the grasslands. (road). (Prelatorian Highway.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A 
luxuriant example of the richness of Aetolia and the continent of Sapience, the 
grasslands through which you are passing radiate vitality and strength. Even the
inroads made by grazing animals carrying riders or being herded along the road 
have not made any significant impact upon the fringes. The grasses grow thickly 
and one would be foolish to try to press through them when the highway runs 
smooth and clear instead. An enormous golem composed of shale and onyx looms 
over its surroundings here. Irvine is here. He wields a bardiche in his hands. 
Episcopate Sanctus Augustinus is here, covered in silver fur. Surrounded in an 
aura of defilement, Forest Prowler, Thuul Ta'sa is here, covered in black fur.
