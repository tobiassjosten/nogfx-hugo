Arena path. (road). (lost) (Fields of Valor.)
Fluttering on delicate wings, a huge gossamer butterfly flits about the room. A 
raven the colour of night perches nearby and observes curiously with beady black
eyes. Silent and observant, a red fox stands here, alertly watching all with a 
cunning glint of the eye. Nervously pacing, a small brown lemming scampers under
your feet. A grumpy badger stands here, snuffling about angrily. Hackles raised,
an adult grey wolf sniffs the air for enemies. Sir Asilient Windrayn is here. He
wields a tower shield in his left hand and a hunter's spear in his right.
You see exits leading north, east and southwest.

flesh of other creatures stands here. Dhasan Missari "Snake Eyes" Selannor is 
here, hidden. She wields a dirk in her left hand and a glacial tower shield in 
her right.
