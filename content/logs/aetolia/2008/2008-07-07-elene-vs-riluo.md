Strong walls support this sturdy building. Plain and unadorned, it was obviously
built with practicality and durability in mind. Though chipped and battered, 
this room shows no signs of collapse within the near future. Near the eastern 
wall is a dust and grit covered desk and ages old yellowed papers still sitting 
atop it, weighted down with a paperweight made of petrified wood. Off to the 
west is a heavy steel door which sports three different locks, none of which 
seem to function. You see exits leading southeast, southwest and west.

A large slab of jagged, porous obsidian rests here, claw marks gouge across it's
surface as if to hint that something other an eruption sent this large object so
far from its volcanic home. Wreaths of amaranth and blood orchid have been woven
and laid upon the rock. A strange aroma of burnt herbs, blood and other unknown 
things declare that it has been used as a sacrificial altar. Duke Riluo 
Voltaire, Elder of the Blood is here, hidden. He wields a runed steel scythe in 
his hands. You see exits leading northeast, southeast and southwest.

White hangings have been used to give this room a stark contrast to the 
surrounding area. From here, one might watch the competitors within the arena. 
Five tiers of long, curving benches are arranged in a semi-circle, their 
surfaces dark and blotched with some undefined substances. Small patches of 
carefully cultivated moss gather at even intervals against the base of the 
walls, their phosphorescent glow offering moderate and indirect lighting. A 
chill wind whistles down from some unseen crevice in the ceiling, fluttering 
against the white material and causing an eerie and constant, though faint, 
keening. To the east the bright glow of torches beckons those who would more 
than observe. A ring of dripstones extends from both the ceiling above and the
