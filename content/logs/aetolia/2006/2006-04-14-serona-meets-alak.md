Alak shakes his head.

Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind says, "I was wondering if I could do the 
same."

Alak smirks.

The corners of Alak's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind says, "Actually... I could use your help."
 
Alak pauses for a second, a slight frown upon his face.

You say, "How may I be of service?"
 
Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind says to you, "I must admit... I am.."

Alak ponders the situation.

Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind places the spectacles on his blind face 
once more.

Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind alak turns his blind gaze down on you, his
smile fading as he demands in a cold voice, "Sit.".

Serona frowns slightly, taking a deep breath as she settles herself on the ground. 

You sit yourself down.

In a sensuously fluid motion, Alak reaches out and draws you close, baring pale
fangs before sinking them into the tender flesh of your neck.  Horrified, you 
go limp as the pain intermingles with indescribable pleasure.

You shudder in agonizing ecstasy as Alak drinks deeply the lifeblood from your 
trembling body, sating his dark appetite.

then..."

things."

licks the remaining blood from his mouth.

Then, a bit later...
QUOTE

Alak tells you, "Pardon the interruption... I am curious."

Alak tells you, "What led you to the Indorani?"

You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "I have... a fascination for 
those who understand where true strength lies."

Alak tells you, "True strength?"

You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "Aye, most people think they 
draw strength from abiding codes of honor and conduct. I left home young, I 
learned quite a bit standing in the shadows and watching how people interact 
with one another."

Alak tells you, "That still does not answer the question... This, "true 
strength" you speak of."

Alak tells you, "This sounds quite relative... You still desire food, correct? 
You still drown without oxygen?"
 
You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "Indeed. You do. Those are 
necessities of life. Strength comes from understanding, I think. Those who 
restrict themselves by the moral codes of others can never really truly 
understand either themselves, their allies or their enemies."

You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "They limit their growth and 
their actions, foolishly, to my mind."

Alak tells you, "To befriend another is to invite betrayal."

You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "Truth."

Alak tells you, "Allies are pointless... if not only necessary at times."

Alak tells you, "So, once more... humor me. Why the Indorani? Why not seek even
darker... even greater power?"

You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "I have pondered it."

Alak tells you, "And what have these contemplations led you to believe?"

You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "I admit that I have a great 
fascination with that... power. But I have not been very exposed to it. I based
my choices on the thing I had the greater knowledge of. I do not generally 
enjoy blind leaps."

Alak tells you, "If I might be so bold as to speak in honest..."

Alak tells you, "I have been watching you, little Dehaka."

Alak tells you, "For two months.
 
You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "Why have you taken such an 
interest in me?"

Alak tells you, "Curiosity... boredom..."

Alak tells you, "With an eternity to waste, I am in need of entertainment."

You tell Minister of Bahir'an, Alak the blind, "I can understand both quite 
well. And have you come to any conclusions about my character, then?"
