--- Before a broken obelisk ------- 0:4:0 ---
Midnight black, the remnants of an enourmous stone obelisk stand here, leaning precariously onto a great tree in the distant southwest. The monument's dimensions are immense having once been several hundred feet tall. The surface is exquisite, its polish unscathed by time or erosion. A falcon is perched here, its bright eyes regarding its surroundings watchfully. Edhain de Verdigris is riding on a pale warhorse. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his left hand and a slender golden rapier in his right.
You see exits leading east and west.

                           --------------------
As fighters, we must carefully hone our reflexes. This art can be
difficult for some novices to master. The guild, and its city, stands
ready to train new combatants.

Thus, it is highly recommended that recruits endeavor to join The Front
Line, a clan dedicated to training the militia in combat and warfare. It
contains many resources that will aid an aspiring knight in toning his
body and mind.

Though this clan is in service to the Beacon, it is pledged to the
Paladin guild, for we are the strong arm of the Light.

Those who wish to join this clan may contact Sir Yos, the Arch-Justiciar
and Knight Marshall of Enorian, or Sir Edhain.

Other combat training aids exist in the guild textbook, and the arena.
The best cure for ineptitude is practice. Anyone can learn, it is purely
a matter of will.

A paladin who has reached the rank of Chevalier may decide that they
wish to become a novice aide and assist the Lord of Pages with new
recruits. Not only must you be of appropriate rank, but you also should
be well-versed in the ways of the guild and have proven to conduct
yourself in an appropriate manner. If you feel you may be well-suited
for this position then you must obtain the approval of both the Lord of
Pages and the Guildmaster.

look edhain
He is a dexterous Yeleni, the power of his form muted by a calm and quiet demeanor. Tall and lean, with deep black eyes and short raven-hued hair, he enshrouds himself in intense solemnity that bespeaks of silent purpose. Stark, broad shoulders taper to lithe limbs, his deft fingers bearing the calluses of extended swordsmanship and archery. A straight nose, strong jaw, and nobly-furrowed brow contribute to the tension held by the harsh line of his mouth; although his long and narrow face is unscarred, his grim visage seems oft haunted by sorrow. He is wearing:
dark iron platemail
a ring of the flood
a heavy necklace of Anaxagorite links
an iron-laced black leather bandolier
an etched emerald and diamond ring
a tower shield
7 masculine, blackened iron bands
bone-plated archery bracers
a dwarven pendant of blackened iron
a pair of loose pitch-black corded cotton trousers
a grim anaxagorite gauntlet
a cloak of obscurity
