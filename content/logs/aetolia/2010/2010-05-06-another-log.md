Beryl Promenade nearing the jousting grounds. (Enorian.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A large archway stands over the entrance to the Jousting Grounds here, the words "For Valor!" engraved into the granite. The words seem to glow with a small flame of their own, symbolizing the flames that also guide the city. A large fist has been carved from a huge piece of granite and placed at the side of the road. It bears within its grasp a large torch, the flame ever-burning to keep the area illuminated. Around the rock someone has planted small flowers, the bed carefully maintained. A large winged hourglass hovers over an ornately carved pillar, a bright golden glow pouring from it. Tossing her august mane, a sprightly white mare stands here. An argent intercessor is poised here, hefting an ancient-looking halberd in her glowing hands. Grand Mistress Aithinne Fiadhaich is here.
You see exits leading southeast, south, northwest and in.

He is a muscular Earthen and towers at a bit under eight feet tall. Medium sized clusters of crystalline shards stick out from various parts of his structure often followed by small fissures where sand falls grain by grain. A strong jaw dominates his face, its flat strength reflecting lights while strong green eyes glare at his surroundings in a illuminated glow. The earth that composes his body is rough and sectioned into defined plates that give his body a strong physique. His feet seem to pull at the earth as if in reluctance to leave him. The etchings of the letter 'B' faintly glows on the topsides of his hands. He is wearing:
a Year 250 ring
a tower shield
a white leather vest with silver buckles

an enormous tophat

The Prelatorian Highway. (road) (Prelatorian Highway.)
Filling the firmament is a lattice of heavy grey clouds. Even those who look eastward and shade their eyes still cannot see the limits of the roadway in that direction. The gaze is drawn, however, to a shimmer of water and what appears to be a bridge of some sort. The Morgun Forest broods along the southern fringes of the highway, and around the bend northwest of here is a highway junction. The prevailing winds blow to the east, carrying with them the scent of grasslands and the mould of the nearby forest. The area has been flooded with sand. There are 2 holdfast sigils here. A glowing red flame-shaped sigil has been left here. A stallion grazes nearby, dappled sandy fur gleaming. A chaos hound restlessly paces in a circle. A puffy black bloodleech scutters about in the dirt here. Standing with arms crossed, a minion of chaos scrutinizes its surroundings. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, flexing its long wiry antennae. A hand-sized tick quivers on the ground. A puddle of green slime bubbles on the floor. A mutated humanoid rat sniffs about, reeking of filth. A white worm squirms on the ground. There are 2 clay golems here. A cloaked figure is here. He wields a chipped bone dagger in his left hand and a runed shield in his right. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He wields a menacing flail in his left hand and a burnished bronze crozier in his right. The monstrous form of Kaeus stands here, his stony body towering above you. He wields a menacing flail in his left hand and an elegant crozier in his right. God-King Desian Arcan, Immortal Sovereign is here.
You see exits leading east and northwest.

The Prelatorian Highway. (road) (Prelatorian Highway.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Even those who look eastward and shade their eyes still cannot see the limits of the roadway in that direction. The gaze is drawn, however, to a shimmer of water and what appears to be a bridge of some sort. The Morgun Forest broods along the southern fringes of the highway, and around the bend northwest of here is a highway junction. The prevailing winds blow to the east, carrying with them the scent of grasslands and the mould of the nearby forest. The area has been flooded with sand. There are 2 holdfast sigils here. A glowing red flame-shaped sigil has been left here. A stallion grazes nearby, dappled sandy fur gleaming. A chaos hound restlessly paces in a circle. A puffy black bloodleech scutters about in the dirt here. Standing with arms crossed, a minion of chaos scrutinizes its surroundings. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, flexing its long wiry antennae. A hand-sized tick quivers on the ground. A puddle of green slime bubbles on the floor. A mutated humanoid rat sniffs about, reeking of filth. A white worm squirms on the ground. There are 2 clay golems here. A copper falcon is here, his verdigris eyes keenly scanning the area. A bit of slippery elm lies here. A valerian leaf has been dropped here. A skullcap flower lies here. A cloaked figure is here. He wields a chipped bone dagger in his left hand and a runed shield in his right. The monstrous form of Alaron stands here, his stony body towering above you. He wields a menacing flail in his left hand and a burnished bronze crozier in his right. The monstrous form of Kaeus stands here, his stony body towering above you. He wields a menacing flail in his left hand and an elegant crozier in his right. God-King Desian Arcan, Immortal Sovereign is here.
