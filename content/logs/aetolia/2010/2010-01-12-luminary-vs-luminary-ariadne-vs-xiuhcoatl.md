Xiuhcoatl's chest, it flares brightly, impossibly, white, and enters his breast. The Angel's eyes 
roll back in its head in ecstasy as she rips the soul from Xiuhcoatl's body. Xiuhcoatl collapses 
without a sound; his body now nothing more than a useless husk.

Problem:
Lightning Was buffed to do a bit more damage, and make it viable for high-int statpacks. 
Unfortunately the combination of not enough buffing, and being heavily reducible makes it not much 
use for us.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Buff it a little bit more by making it a bit less reducible, and make it do fire/lightning damage.
Solution #2:
make it give Darkshade, and make the orbs from GLOW in illumination set off the darkshade tick, like
lightwalls do for Syssin. This just seems to be a really suitable skill for luminaries.
Solution #3:
make it give paralysis (boooring)
