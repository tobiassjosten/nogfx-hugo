You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Um, why was I enemied?"

Edhain tells you, "You were phased in a shopfront."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "No I wasn't.. When?"

Edhain tells you, "Yesterday."

Edhain tells you, "If you lie to me, I will add obstruction of justice to your list of offenses."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Don't want that. Why do you think I was phased in a shop yesterday?"

Edhain tells you, "Citizenry report."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Who? Why do they think it was me?"

Edhain tells you, "By your smell, it was said."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Do I get the unenemied when you lie? Or do I only get more enemying when I lie?"

Edhain tells you, "The latter."

Edhain tells you, "I do not lie."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Darn, cause I'm fairly certain phased Syssin don't smell. Nor do I believe I could be identified by my odor. I'm very clean..."

Edhain tells you, "Well, I am sorry for your loss of illusion."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "It wasn't me though. I don't smell. How can you smell something that doesn't smell?"

Edhain tells you, "The word used in reference with your body odor was actually 'stench' and not 'smell', judging by the city's recordian."

Edhain tells you, "Ask a Rajamalan."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "I am Rajamalan, so I know how important hygeine is. I don't smell! Nor do I emit any sort of 'stench' I'm aware of. Least of all do I emit a stench while supposedly hiding from someone."

Edhain tells you, "Tell me, Seurimas. Why ought I trust a Syssin's words over those of my citizenry?"


You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "I'm not implying your citizenry lied, but their nose was mistaken. Are they even Rajamalan? Or at least a lycanthrope of some sort?"

Edhain tells you, "I would not know."

Edhain tells you, "You need be neither to develop an enhanced sense of smell, though."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Yeleni then?"

Edhain tells you, "Why assume that?"

Edhain tells you, "See, you must have been there to know."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Because that's the only other group I can imagine would be able to pin me by my smell whilst I'm phased."

Edhain tells you, "Nay."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "But it was a Yeleni then?"

Edhain tells you, "You were located by your smell. What do you think?"

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "I don't think I smell enough for someone to smell me while I'm phased in any case."

Edhain tells you, "As this is apparently incorrect, what is your next conclusion?"

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Well unfortunately that's the crux of my argument. They couldn't smell me while I'm phased. They were mistaken."

Edhain tells you, "I am more inclined to trust the citizenry report than a Syssin, then."

Edhain tells you, "If you are interested, your phasing was classed as a major offense. You may peruse our laws at your leisure to understand what that means."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Well then, beyond being enemied, what has my alleged odor cost me?"

Edhain tells you, "I am not certain. Has it cost you women? Business transactions?"

Edhain tells you, "A professional demeanor?"

Edhain tells you, "That is your affair."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "A fee? A bounty? Perhaps I am required to apologize to the store owner?"

Edhain tells you, "Your fine is thirty thousand and your sentence ten years as befits a major offense."

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Err, sentence is mandatory enemy period?"

You express your esteem of Edhain for Ha, smell, I get it now.

Edhain tells you, "Aye. Should you offer compelling evidence or proof to the contrary of your crime, you will be permitted amnesty. Should the Council unanimously to grant its permission, you may pay a steeper fee in lieu of serving sentence. Should you infiltrate the city or attempt to bypass the law, you will be levied with additional crimes. Fair?"

You tell Edhain de Verdigris, "Fair."

Edhain tells you, "Pray recall in the future that hiding in any form is against the law in the Beacon, unless you are part of her militia, and that Syssin are not protected guests."
