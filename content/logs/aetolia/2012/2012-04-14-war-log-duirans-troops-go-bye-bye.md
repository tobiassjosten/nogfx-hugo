A plush, butterfly-adorned cushion sits here invitingly. A magnificent toy replica of the Citadel is here. There are 5 
multi-colored crystal star earrings here. A gold stud earring has been dropped here. Darkly glinting, a polished crown of thorns 
has been placed here. A regal crown of polished platinum with a ruby-red velvet lining sits here. There are 2 golden circlets 
here. Forming a perfect circle, a headband of beaten iron sits here. There are 2 circlet adorned with acorns here. There are 3 
towering crowns of bone spikes here. The filigree shape of a silver crown adorned with a white pearl sits here. Totemic animals 
made from stag's horn adorn this braided leather circlet here. A circlet of tightly woven branches and vines has been left here. A
mire hound is sniffing at the remains of some small animal. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the 
ground. A cloaked figure is here, hidden. She is riding on a grey mule. She wields a slender halberd of steel and obsidian in her 
hands. Meruin is here. He wields a tower shield in his left hand.

Skirting the Vashnar mountains. (Mhojave desert.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A rotting skeleton has been piked here, its bony hands

Alain and Ishin follow you to the east.
A crack in the mountainside. (Mhojave desert.)
Holding his own head between his hands, a statue of a decapitated man slumps here. A granite monument stands here, its surface 
polished to a shine. A pike with a shriveled head has been stuck here as warning to any intruder who would dare enter Bloodloch. A
twilit tapestry hangs here, the dark embroidery depicting a triumph of darkness. Like sharp teeth, a few stalagmites reach up from
the ground here. Staked into the ground, a massive black banner is here. Staked into the ground, a black and red flag is here.

Kiyotan speaks in an eloquent and thickly-accented language that is quick on the tongue.
As the power word is spoken, the symbols along a runed spiral horn brighten with an unearthly glow. Kiyotan raises the horn to his
lips and looses a seismic bellow, sonorous and resonant. Filling the air with sound, the sonic vibration warps the space around 
him, creating a portal through which he strides. The fading echo rings in your ears.

At the edge of the Ithmia forest. (Northern Ithmia.)
A mist of fog and dust swirls around the area, marking it as contested territory. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it 
with spiderwebs of grey. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a burden. A fearsome group of one hundred sand daemons is
here. They wear the blessing of Ivoln. A cluster of one hundred durdalis clacks about in haphazard formation. Kiyotan is here, 
hidden. He wields a lethal dragonbone dhurive in his hands.

Grouped in a tight, menacing phalanx formation, rows of towering sand daemons stand at the ready, the red on black banner of 
Bloodloch flying above them. Seemingly carved from solid sandstone, the monstrous troops loom imposingly at nearly ten feet tall, 
massive stone clubs resting on their bulky shoulders. Splotches of solidified lava speckle the stony skin of the warriors, and 
scrapes and scars tell the tales of many battles.
A division of one hundred sand daemons looks weak and feeble.
It is under the command of Moirean.
It has dug in and fortified in this position.
They wear the blessing of Ivoln.
They are loyal to the City of Bloodloch.

Bristling with unbridled fury, Sibatti's feral snarl rips across the skies, "Tell me, Moirean, just what do you plan to do once 
you get bored, inevitably, again? And people tire of your self-indulgent antics, again? I take respite that, at the end of the

You shout, "You all call me a traitor, but I'm not the one who just suicided half of your troops."

Like the thunderous growl of a rojalli, Ishin's voice splits the skies, "One would hope she wouldn't suicide her own troops...but

You shout, "It's true. I never could suicide half my own troops. I actually know what I'm doing."
