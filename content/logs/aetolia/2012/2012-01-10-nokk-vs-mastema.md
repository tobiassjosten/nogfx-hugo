The thick canopy prevents sunlight from reaching the jungle floor regardless of hour. Strange plants 
grow here, in defiance of the lack of light. Fleshy vines with long, dark spines lash themselves to 
rough barked trees and tiny bones liter their bases. The movements of animals in the underbrush 
sound from all directions and the hum of insects, caw of birds and hiss of serpents highlight the 
vibrancy of life within this dark wood. A fresh water stream pours in to pool here, creating a 
watering hole in the darkness through which small, glowing fish dart. Its armored plating covered in 
an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a 
sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here. 
Arch Duke Nokk "The Prodigy" Nebre'seir is here, hidden. He wields a buckler in his left hand and an 
ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

Curving upwards towards the heavens, an enormous crescent of blue glass sparkles and shimmers, and 
an obsidian feather rises majestically from its center. There are 6 wickedly sharp stalagmites here. 
There are 2 severed arms here. Covered with blood, a humanoid leg lies here. An elegant white letter 
is in danger of being soiled here. A simple disc of deep claret crystal lies here nearly forgotten. 
The reflection from an aventurine crystal egg catches your eye as it rests here. A small crystal 
pyramid rests nearby. The ruddy brown hue of this crystal cylinder serves as camoflage as it rests 
nearby. A pentagon carved from a cloudy white crystal lies here. A white unicorn prances about here.
You see a single exit leading northeast.
Nokk arrives from the ether.
He is followed by an enormous male tlingor.

White hangings have been used to give this room a stark contrast to the surrounding area. From here, 
one might watch the competitors within the arena. Five tiers of long, curving benches are arranged 
in a semi-circle, their surfaces dark and blotched with some undefined substances. Small patches of 
carefully cultivated moss gather at even intervals against the base of the walls, their 
phosphorescent glow offering moderate and indirect lighting. A chill wind whistles down from some 
unseen crevice in the ceiling, fluttering against the white material and causing an eerie and 
constant, though faint, keening. To the east the bright glow of torches beckons those who would more 
than observe. Curving upwards towards the heavens, an enormous crescent of blue glass sparkles and 
shimmers, and an obsidian feather rises majestically from its center. There are 6 wickedly sharp 
stalagmites here. There are 2 severed arms here. Covered with blood, a humanoid leg lies here. An 
elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A simple disc of deep claret crystal lies 
here nearly forgotten. The reflection from an aventurine crystal egg catches your eye as it rests 
here. A small crystal pyramid rests nearby. The ruddy brown hue of this crystal cylinder serves as 
camoflage as it rests nearby. A pentagon carved from a cloudy white crystal lies here. A white 
unicorn prances about here. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. 
Snowflakes falling from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here. Its armored plating covered

Glancing down from this dizzying height all one can see is a thick ring of white clouds. The air 
here is cold and beginning to thin. Looking up, however, the top of the Crimson Spire can be seen 
clearly in the distance. Massive bones litter the ground, all old and brittle. Appearing at first 
glance to be a large boulder, a closer inspection reveals the skull of a dragon, half buried in the 
mountainside. Massive jaws snarl soundlessly in death and show off the deadly teeth of a beast which 
must once have been quite formidable. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. 
Snowflakes falling from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here. Unholy chains have been 
summoned to this location.
You see exits leading northeast, east, and southeast.

A wide expanse of the eastern mountain side long ago crumbled under the assault of storm winds and 
this rocky plateau is the result. Small bushes, their roots driven deeply into the granite, clay and 
iron conglomeration, speckle the plateau and defy the screaming gale winds. Hawks cry out, taken 
high by the powerful winds, and the rumbling growl of cougars denote the flourishing echo system 
that exists here. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling

A wide expanse of the eastern mountain side long ago crumbled under the assault of storm winds and 
this rocky plateau is the result. Small bushes, their roots driven deeply into the granite, clay and 
iron conglomeration, speckle the plateau and defy the screaming gale winds. Hawks cry out, taken 
high by the powerful winds, and the rumbling growl of cougars denote the flourishing echo system 
that exists here. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling 
from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here. Its armored plating covered in an icy coat, an 
enormous tlingor lumbers about on powerful legs. Unholy chains have been summoned to this location. 
Arch Duke Nokk "The Prodigy" Nebre'seir is here, sprawled on the floor. He wields a buckler in his 
left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right.
You see exits leading east, southwest, and northwest.

Glancing down from this dizzying height all one can see is a thick ring of white clouds. The air 
here is cold and beginning to thin. Looking up, however, the top of the Crimson Spire can be seen 
clearly in the distance. Massive bones litter the ground, all old and brittle. Appearing at first 
glance to be a large boulder, a closer inspection reveals the skull of a dragon, half buried in the 
mountainside. Massive jaws snarl soundlessly in death and show off the deadly teeth of a beast which 
must once have been quite formidable. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. 
Snowflakes falling from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here.
You see exits leading northeast, east, and southeast.

A wide expanse of the eastern mountain side long ago crumbled under the assault of storm winds and 
this rocky plateau is the result. Small bushes, their roots driven deeply into the granite, clay and 
iron conglomeration, speckle the plateau and defy the screaming gale winds. Hawks cry out, taken 
high by the powerful winds, and the rumbling growl of cougars denote the flourishing echo system 
that exists here. Its armored plating covered in an icy coat, an enormous tlingor lumbers about on 
powerful legs. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling 
from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here. Arch Duke Nokk "The Prodigy" Nebre'seir is here,
 sprawled on the floor. He wields a buckler in his left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right.

A wide expanse of the eastern mountain side long ago crumbled under the assault of storm winds and 
this rocky plateau is the result. Small bushes, their roots driven deeply into the granite, clay and 
iron conglomeration, speckle the plateau and defy the screaming gale winds. Hawks cry out, taken 
high by the powerful winds, and the rumbling growl of cougars denote the flourishing echo system 
that exists here. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. Snowflakes falling 
from its form, a miniature ice elemental rests here.
