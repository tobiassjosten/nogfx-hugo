You tell Aldric Adariel, "You wish to be pardoned from the Sentinel guild, yes?"

Aldric tells you, "Yes."

Central Hall in the Great Oak. (Ancient Heartwood.) (17016)
Esus, Spirit of Sacrifice, floats here with an almost insubstantial body. The huntress Minsja vigilantly surveys the area here, wielding a hunter's spear in her left hand. A large, blood-splattered totem has been erected here, formed of obsidian, ivory and red-wood. Facing outwards and surrounding the totem are a large ivory bear, an obsidian raven and a red-wood serpent. A dark brown root sigil is here. A carven bit of stone has been shaped and etched with runic symbols here, standing vigil over the whole of the Heartwood. Wandering hand fingering a throwing knife, a wilderness scout keeps watch on activity in the area. A metal bucket is here. A massive oaken keg has been set atop a stump here. Armed with a javelin, an Eleusian peltast keeps watch for invaders. A massive circular table is here, a cushioned, mahogany chair placed at it. A leaf has been blown aside, left on the ground. Standing twenty feet high, a colossal dragon totem shadows the area. An elegant obsidian cup has been left on the ground here.
Exits: north, northeast, east (open oak door), southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and up.

You tell Aldric Adariel, "Please meet me at the Heartwood's Central Hall."

Aldric enters from the west, riding a spindly giant spider.

Aldric steps down off of a spindly giant spider.
Aldric slaps a spindly giant spider on the rump and sends it cantering off.

You have emoted: Lin sneers at Aldric's mount with clear distaste, backing away a step.

You have emoted: "If you would follow me," Lin says, making a snappy beckoning motion.

"It's only a spider," Aldric says with a low exhalation of breath, his tone low with a tinge of exhaustion. "He ain't gonna hurt anybody."

Aldric begins to follow you.

<<Sentinels>>: You say, "What shall I do if he does not have a dhurive to break?"

<<Sentinels>>: You say, "I could break something else."

<<Sentinels>>: Seir says, "Could always break him."

Break one over his skull.

<<Sentinels>>: You say, "Ah... had a good idea."

You turn to face Minsja Seluno clenching your right fist and pounding your chest thrice in rapid succession, symbolizing the vibrant heart that beats within.

Minsja Seluno turns to face you clenching her right fist and pounding her chest thrice in rapid succession, symbolizing the vibrant heart that beats within.

A determined look upon her face, Minsja points her spear at the ground directly under your feet. Her eyes radiate with wild power briefly as you feel the ground fall away from under your feet.

Suspended mid-air only momentarily, gravity does its work and you plummet downward only to land agilely on your feet on the Rotunda below.

The Rotunda. (Ancient Heartwood.) (20151)
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.
Exits: north, east, southeast (open pine door), south (open pine door), southwest, west, up (open pine door), and down (open pine door).

Aldric follows you to the east.
A luminous arbour of manifold flora. (Ancient Heartwood.) (20156)
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.
Exits: northeast, southeast, and west.

Aldric follows you to the southeast.
A solemn glade of sundered dhurives. (Ancient Heartwood.) (20159)
Formed into a pathway within the Great Oak itself, this sombre corridor greets the eyes with naught but the sight of broken dhurives impaled upon the floors and walls in different hues of blade and hilt. Indentations and carvings encircle each ancestral blade in ritualistic fashion in memoriam, the merciless embrace of dust and time apparent upon each of these once proud weapons. The walls of this clearing are filled with panoplies of thriving greenery and flora, an apparent testament to the life that endures and a commemoration of the fallen. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Aldric Adariel is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
Exits: northeast (open pine door) and northwest.

You have emoted: "It would be foolish to assume you still have your dhurive, wouldn't it," Lin half-asks, half-declares, leading Aldric amidst a field of shattered weapons.

Aldric's eyes flutter shut as he inhales deeply, then exhales. "I do not," he answers.

You have emoted: Lin turns on her heel, fixing Aldric with a hawk's gaze. "And your medallion?"

Aldric takes a cracked hematite medallion of the Pride from a heavy duty traveling pack.

Aldric gingerly tosses a cracked hematite medallion of the Pride to you, his lips pressed into a thin line.

You have emoted: Lin snaps the iron bauble up in her hand, and for the time being, tucks it behind her back as she stands at a parade rest, arms folded straight. "Sworn by oath, and bound by blood. We of the Sentinel Pride walk upon a path of sacrifice and service. We understand that necessity of our appointed duty, for it is we that have been judged worthy by those that have come before us."

You have emoted: "However..." Lin wanders through the jagged shards of obsidian, her tail finding each and winding around them before slipping free. "There are those that come to us and falter in resolve and can no longer carry the mantle of responsibility that we are charged with."

Aldric's posture shifts somewhat to reflect a slightly more at-ease version of yours, a vague nod an obvious indication he is listening.

You have emoted: At the graveyard's center, Lin spreads her arms wide and proclaims, "Here lie the memories of those who have come before - those who have fallen." And then, more specifically, she gestures at the dhurives around her immediate vicinity, long in blade, bearing minor chips and cracks.

A chill overtakes you, the faint metallic sound of air weaving through the half-buried dhurive blades reaching your ears.

You have emoted: Lin then indicates the outer circle with one hand held aloft. The further from the center, the shorter the discarded weaponry, and at the outermost rings of the yard, there are structures only loosely identifiable as dhurives, mere chips and wedges of obsidian. "To those who have left their Oath behind."

Aldric's gaze at this point diverts from you to land upon the various cracked tips of a dozen or so of the dhurives. His posture visibly seems to straighten, a more tense demeanor seeming to find its way upon his face.

You have emoted: "Aldric, here is where you sacrifice your weapon that has defined you, the one into which you have imbued your craftsmanship, your skills, and your place amongst us as a brother. But you have no such weapon with you - you have allowed it to wither and die. On your knees, if you please." Lin slips her own blade free from her back, resting the flat along her forearm.

You start to wield a vicious dark brown dhurive in your hands.

Aldric's breathing at this point seems to quicken, as noticed by the increased rate at which his chest rises and falls. Nonetheless he slips onto his knees before you, eyes cast shamefully upon the ground. "Hunter," he murmurs, lids shutting now. "This is one wrong righted."

Aldric kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.

You have emoted: Lin clutches her dhurive in both hands - as a former Sentinel, Aldric should know her grip is wrong. However, this seems to be entirely the point, for no sooner has Aldric finished speaking when she surges forward, her feet scything into the earth of the glade, and shatters the flat of the blade over his head, the brittle obsidian exploding against his skull.

A warm, blue, pulsing glow emanates outwards from Aldric's hands that seems to snake over the ground upon which they are placed as his fingers curl inwards to practically claw at the dirt below him. A grimace takes over his countenance, and yet despite this attack he remains in his prone position, teeth visibly gritted.

You have emoted: Lin grunts and brushes black dust from her clothing. The remaining half of a vicious dark brown dhurive she tosses to the ground before Aldric, lifting her chin imperiously as she continues. "This is yours, a reminder of your broken link with the Pride. No longer shall you call yourself Sentinel. Severed to pulse of the Oak, and from our ancestors. We decree your Oath null and void. You are to be given, at your choosing, parting words for your former fellows. Once done, leave this place."

You have emoted: Thus concluded, Lin takes up Aldric's medallion, rubbing her thumb fondly over its glinting surface. With a grunt of exertion, she squeezes it tightly in her palm, warping the metal, stressing it to the breaking point, and hurls it to the ground, where it cracks into discrete chunks, leaking old blood from its hollow center.

"There ain't any words to be said," Aldric slowly, quietly says. His gaze levels upon the broken medallion, then slowly lingers up towards you. After a gruff inhalation of breath that he holds for but a few moments longer than normal, he rises, fists held at his side.

You have emoted: "Off with you then, Aldric Luminary," Lin replies, tucking her middle finger behind her thumb and snapping it at the air. "Begone from the Oak - you walk away with your life. Live it fully."

"Thanks," is Aldric's only meager reply, his hand stretching towards that of his angel's. Despite this single-syllable response, his intentional, pointed eye contact with you seems to betray a sort of cowed respect and genuine appreciation.

Aldric flickers briefly and is gone.
Aldric leaves to the ether.
