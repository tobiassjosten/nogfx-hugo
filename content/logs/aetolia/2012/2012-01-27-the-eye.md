A large scientific laboratory.
A ruddy farmer with a sharp pitchfork stands here, eyeing you warily. Ghada 
stands here awkwardly on a leg, her hands folded into the burnt sleeves of her 
robe. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. 
There are 15 brass ingots here. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for 
a burden. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, flexing its long wiry antennae. 
Diancecht Zann is here. Arch Duchess Alyssn D'baen is here. She wields a wicked, 
curved scalpel in her left hand. Imparter Larissa Kizatiy-Krough is here. Dark 
Scholar, Evilo Krogh-Nebre'seir is here. He wields an ivory scalpel in his left 
hand and a tower shield in his right.

-- Diancecht: cotell show respect to you? not particularly. i don't follow you 
anywhere, i was a damn good councilor, and so what if we're not showing the same 
kind of effort? we aren't the same person and i'm very thankful of that
(Congregation): Diancecht says, "Show respect to you? Not particularly. I don't 
follow you anywhere, I was a damn good Councilor, and so what if we're not 
showing the same kind of effort? We aren't the same person and I'm very thankful 
of that."

(Congregation): You say, "I didn't mean respect to -me-, you nitwit."

(Congregation): You say, "Do you even wish to be in Her Order? Do you wish to 
serve Her? Do you have any intention of trying?"

-- Diancecht: cotell i told you a few moments ago. i'm here for personal reasons.
 the nightmare invited me, and unless she tells me to leave i have no intention 
of going anywhere. anything else you wanted to discuss, or just that?
(Congregation): Diancecht says, "I told you a few moments ago. I'm here for 
personal reasons. The Nightmare invited me, and unless She tells me to leave I 
have no intention of going anywhere. Anything else you wanted to discuss, or 
just that?"

(Congregation): You say, "Who do you think you are speaking to? I am not some 
grunt."

-- Diancecht: cotell and i'm not just standing around waiting patiently to speak 
to you. i have things to do and things to work on, and you're interrupting them. 
this doesn't exactly seem very important right now
(Congregation): Diancecht says, "And I'm not just standing around waiting 
patiently to speak to you. I have things to do and things to work on, and you're 
interrupting them. This doesn't exactly seem very important right now."

(Congregation): You say, "Like playing with your disgusting vampire friends."

(Congregation): You say, "Divine Orders are managed by mortals. Us. -Me-. She 
will not hold your hand and keep you safe from big, bad Lin. I asked Her to slay 
you, and She thought it would be funny!"

(Congregation): You say, "Decide where you want to be. Decide what you are going 
to put effort into. Quit wasting everyone's time - it is embarassing."

-- Diancecht: cotell perhaps. is there anything else you want to discuss?
(Congregation): Diancecht says, "Perhaps. Is there anything else you want to 
discuss?"

(Congregation): You say, "Not at all. Enjoy the congregation while you can. It 
is all you will see."

-- Diancecht: cotell interesting. if i haven't done anything, how am i wasting 
your time beyond you insisting on this conversation?
(Congregation): Diancecht says, "Interesting. If I haven't done anything, how am 
I wasting your time beyond you insisting on this conversation?"

Most recent tells:
1 . Omei: "Claims."
2 . Lin: "I cannot possibly comprehend what he means by that."
3 . Levi: "I get the feeling he is not going to be able to talk for a while."
4 . Lin: "If I was not doing what I am currently doing my first instinct would 
be to tear his throat out."
5 . Omei: "Shh, sh sh sh. He has put his *mind* up for gamble."
6 . Levi: "Are we still defiling Ivoln's shrines?"
7 . Lin: "I would see no good reason not to - just remember, we are few in 
number and at this point it is little more than harassment."
8 . Llok: "You know, I think we could make good use of Moirean."
9 . Llok: "I shall bid a sum of money for her in this auction and then see what 
the Nightmare would have her do! Could be an interesting little game."
10. Levi: "I am already working with her to try to kill Ison and some of Ivoln's 
Order."
11. Llok: "Hopefully I soon will be able to rejoin the fun of fighting."
12. Llok: "All well?"
13. Lin: "Very well."
14. Llok: "Good good!"
15. Lin: "Aha, ha ha! What is it, Mother!"
16. Omei: "I was *bored*... dreadfully *bored*."
17. Lin: "Torture Diancecht!"
18. Lin: "People tend to want to moralize and quantify things, and it really 
takes all the fun out of it."
19. Lin: "Mother!"
20. Lin: "Hurry!"

withdrawing a syringe from his pocket and stabbing it into larissa's thigh, 
emptying the contents with a nod

Before the Spirean Institute. (road)
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A small obelisk of translucent onyx 
has been raised here, a golden plaque affixed upon its surface. A sewer grate 
looms darkly beneath your feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular 
monolith is on the ground. There are 2 cabalists of jherza here. Leaning calmly 
on his staff, a Guardian of the Master Crystals stands here. Quiet and unmoving 
as stone, a lupine Atabahi stands guard here. There are 2 farmer with a 
pitchforks here. Diancecht Zann is here.
Exits: north (open pine door) and south.
You have gained the blindness defence.

(Order): You say, "Mm. Suppose you heard that."

(Order): Llok says, "Noooope."

2012/01/27 03:54:20 - Rictus has left the Congregation.
2012/01/27 10:31:43 - Diancecht has been removed from the Congregation.

(Order): You say, "Ah, well then."

(Order): Llok says, "Just woken up in my haven, have I missed anything 
interesting?"

(Order): You say, "Removing rabble from the congregation."

(Order): You say, "You also missed a divine wrestling match between Mother and 
the Lady Lleis. It was... breathtaking."

(Order): You say, "I am being very literal."

(Order): Llok says, "Diancecht the little Syssin?"

(Order): You say, "He took just a little time from playing doctor with his 
vampire friends to mouth off to me like some insignificant sibling."

(Order): Llok says, "He had purpose."

(Order): Llok says, "Now we have to find a new one."

(Order): You say, "You really do not know him that well. He is more than useless."

(Order): You say, "By the gods, he was in Damariel's order when I was. He was a -
spy-."

(Order): Llok says, "Mmmmm, Omei wanted him."

(Order): You say, "She wants everyone, Llok."

(Order): Llok says, "But she wanted a little Syssin. Do you have 
another?"

(Order): You say, "I can give her a man one hundred times his worth."

(Order): Llok says, "A little Syssin?"

(Order): You say, "What does it matter if it is a Syssin!"

(Order): You say, "If she wishes for playthings, for toys, she has the entire 
world to choose from! They do not need to make half-assed attempts to spread for 
Her. They cannot work for Her."

(Order): You say, "That should be a -privilege-."

(Order): Llok says, "I am the Eye, I see things you do not and am partial to 
things that you are not."

(Order): You say, "You can hardly see over your own prick, do not give me that."

(Order): Llok says, "Then you know why She wants a Syssin, yes?"

(Order): You say, "Eeerragh! No, I do not!"

(Order): Llok says, "I know you didn't. I know you don't see. I know you're not 
privileged. I won't hold it against you, little toy. She might. I hope she does."

(Order): You say, "I cannot -imagine- She wants him for a spy. He told me you 
sent him to spy on people, he could not even remember who. He cannot read a 
man's mind, it is ridiculous."

(Order): Llok says, "Why do you assume on behalf of a Nightmare, little 
toy?"

(Order): You say, "I am... not..."

(Order): You say, "Tell me this, -Eye-. Do you know what Her temple looks 
like?"

(Order): You say, "Have you seen it?"

: Diancecht has joined the Congregation.

(Order): Llok says, "If it is as is, yes. If it isn't, no. Do you believe that 
so valid, little toy?"

(Order): Llok says, "Omei has a purpose, little toy."

(Order): You say, "When you call me 'little toy,' is it jealousy? Or do you use 
it to continually establish your superiority?"

(Order): You say, "Ask yourself why She has not shown you Her temple, while you 
sit up there in your haven."

(Order): Llok says, "I am an old toy, not a superior one."

(Order): You say, "... Right, then."

(Order): Llok says, "You are a source of drama, I can see why She likes you."

(Order): You say, "You -are- a fan of throw-away words, aren't you. I am 
learning your language. I will be fluent in it soon."

(Order): Llok says, "Want to know my biggest service to the Nightmare, 
presently?"

(Order): You say, "Speak it."

(Order): Llok says, "Stopping myself from tearing you to pieces."

(Order): Llok says, "I don't know why, I want to like you but you infuriate me."

(Order): You say, "You do not like anyone who speaks their mind, I imagine. No 
one does."

(Order): You say, "Doubly so when they appear to have no respect for authority 
or seniority."

(Order): Llok says, "Maybe that is it. I did not prejudge you when you prejudged 
me."

(Order): You say, "There was no prejudging. You spoke at length, then I judged."

(Order): Llok says, "No, no, we barely spoke before Ingram and your thoughts on 
that matter."

(Order): You say, "To be perfectly honest, Llok, I have come to enjoy goading 
you. There is a capriciousness to Mother that I have begun to cherish. She may 
appear childish at times, but there is a method to Her madness!"

(Order): You say, "I have often wished you -would- come and try to tear me apart,
rather than bottling those emotions inside. Is that not indulgence, my 
Eye?"

(Order): Llok says, "Mmmm, one of the few sense of duties I act on is essence, 
these days. I die enough at lessers as my desire to not cost the Nightmare more 
essence is greater than my desire for your blood."

(Order): You say, "Tcha! Then disturb me no further."

The following members of the Congregation are in the realm:
Name                Status

Llok
Diancecht
Lin
------------------------------------------------------------

(Order): You say, "And I will consider you responsible for Diancecht's actions. 
Believe me, I know this man - you will regret him."

(Order): Llok says, "A source of regret other than you will be good for me, I 
think. Balance, as it were."

(Order): You say, "Sorry, my friend. Omei wanted a little toy."
