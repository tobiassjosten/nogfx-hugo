Carefully built with blood stained stonework, the walls and floor of this chamber resonate with the 
blood and toils of all those who have entered before. The central flooring of the room is dominated 
by a wide, circular depression of black sand and tiny shards of glass. The sand and glass mixture 
sits level with the stone flooring, and is kept meticulously raked and cleared from the stones when 
not in use. There are 2 monolith sigils here. A stout donkey stands patiently by, waiting for a 
burden. Ears perked as it sniffs about, a sleek arctic wolf is nearby. A cloaked figure is here. A 
murky darkness has settled in here.
You see a single exit leading north.
