Understanding more about Spirit, generally, and strengthening Spirit [0m[1;36mwithin the world must be an important aspect of who we are.

We should be knowledgeable and able to offer guidance [0m[1;36mand advice to others based on that knowledge. Based on a conversation with Balam [0m[1;36mAgab from a year or so ago, the divinities are the ones who are ultimately [0m[1;36mresponsible for their elemental planes. It therefore stands to reason that a piece [0m[1;36mof our objectives must be to strengthen those divinities aligned with spirit. [0m[1;36mParticularly emphasizing the strengthening of Lord Damariel as He is the divinity [0m[1;36mdirectly responsible for the Spirit realm."[0m

The old Master Crystal room, which I agree needs [0m[1;36mupdating, could be revised into a lab of sorts for testing and experiment. Mariena [0m[1;36mproposed moving the libraries into a tower, withour private library being somehow [0m[1;36mbarred to anyone but those in the Ascendril. That could also act as a special third [0m[1;36mroom, like a Font of Spirit to go with the other two elementally themed rooms. In [0m[1;36maddition, Kendri suggested a sort of elemental shroud that results from spending [0m[1;36mtime near the different elemental sources as well as the addition of a shrine to [0m[1;36mLady Auresae.
