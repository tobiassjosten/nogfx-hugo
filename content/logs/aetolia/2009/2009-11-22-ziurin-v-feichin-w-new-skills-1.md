Echoing caverns. (lost)
A series of deep indentions within the cave walls give a false sense of endless 
exits. Chips of limestone liter the floor and powdery white guano mixes with the
rich black soil to muffle the sound of foot steps. The sound of running water, 
the shrill screeching of bats, the skittering of mice and other tiny animals, 
all these sounds come together to form an echoing cacophony of life. Like sharp 
teeth, a few stalagmites reach up from the ground here. A massive golem made of 
clay stands here.
You see exits leading north, south and southwest.
