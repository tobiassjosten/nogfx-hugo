[11:05.55]A broad grassy bank opens onto a rough trail that leads northwards up between the bluffs and forested hill, thick brush lining both sides of the pathway. Squat trees cling to the bank, branches leaning out over the water, their twisting roots rising clear of the soil and heaped in thick, snaking coils along the ridge where the water meets land. Long shadows slip along the horizon and the clear sound of sheep echoes down through the hills. Surrounded in an aura of defilement, Bahkatu Disciple, Dei Beddict is here, covered in black fur. You see exits leading north and south.

[11:06.29]A broad grassy bank opens onto a rough trail that leads northwards up between the bluffs and forested hill, thick brush lining both sides of the pathway. Squat trees cling to the bank, branches leaning out over the water, their twisting roots rising clear of the soil and heaped in thick, snaking coils along the ridge where the water meets land. Long shadows slip along the horizon and the clear sound of sheep echoes down through the hills. Surrounded in an aura of defilement, Bahkatu Disciple, Dei Beddict is here, covered in black fur. You see exits leading north and south.

[11:08.17]A broad grassy bank opens onto a rough trail that leads northwards up between the bluffs and forested hill, thick brush lining both sides of the pathway. Squat trees cling to the bank, branches leaning out over the water, their twisting roots rising clear of the soil and heaped in thick, snaking coils along the ridge where the water meets land. Long shadows slip along the horizon and the clear sound of sheep echoes down through the hills. Surrounded in an aura of defilement, Bahkatu Disciple, Dei Beddict is here, covered in black fur. You see exits leading north and south.
