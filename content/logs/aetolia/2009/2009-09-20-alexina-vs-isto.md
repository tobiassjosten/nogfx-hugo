Descent to the Pools of Soulfire.
Some irid moss gives off dim light. A bloodroot plant is growing here. A grub writhes here, its many tiny legs flailing. An aura of anger emanates from the gnarled spirit of a dead priest nearby. Green eyes unblinking, a fiery salamander is here. Blade of Lunare, Sir Isto Lunare-Cardinalis is here. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in his left hand and a tower shield in his right.
You see exits leading southeast and southwest.
With a cry of delight you skewer Isto on your blade, who writhes and screams as the cruel metal is driven deep into his flesh.

With a vicious snarl you carve a merciless swathe through the steaming guts of Isto, who gurgles and chokes as you withdraw your dripping blade, glistening with gore.
The last vestiges of strength having ebbed from Isto's body, he sinks to the floor with a sigh. Suddenly, your surroundings are enveloped in a blinding white light, forcing you to cower with your hands over your eyes. When you tentatively open them once more, you are astonished to find Isto alive once more.
Isto quickly changes back into Yeleni form.
Your victim is protected by a caged soul.
