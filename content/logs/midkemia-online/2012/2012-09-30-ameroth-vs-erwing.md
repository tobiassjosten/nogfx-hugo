Erwing arrives from the northwest.
look
Within the hills.
The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds. The hills spread out like a picture, 
the nearby road a dark river piercing through the greens and yellows of the grasses, and far to the 
south, signs of habitation and buildings can be seen though it is partially concealed by hills and 
the trees that grow upon them. A variety of short and scrubby bushes grow nearby, each of them 
bearing long black thorns. With his line cast into the water, Herman Pequod enjoys a relaxing bout 
of fishing. A shimmering Rift of gray fog floats in the air, forming a portal to another place. 
Erwing Kilara, the Hawk is here. He wields a curve-bladed dagger with a winged cross-guard in his 
left hand and a curved saber with a hilt resembling a perched hawk in his right. You see a sign 
instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading northwest, south, northeast, and through a shimmering Rift.
