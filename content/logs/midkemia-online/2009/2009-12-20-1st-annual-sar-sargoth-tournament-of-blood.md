Assembly hall inside the Citadel.
A large chamber has been built not far inside the entrance to this ancient 
fortress. The large ceiling is vaulted with support beams adding interior 
strength to the already impressive frame. The large stones on the floor are 
chipped but worn smooth and there are hundreds of markings upon them as if 
laying out lines for many men to gather. Large tapestries on the walls depict 
battles while the sconces in the walls for torches appear to be made from the 
skulls of humanoids, candles in each flickering light up the walls. On the 
northern wall a large throne has been placed atop the skulls of several hundred 
humanoids. The obsidian throne has a large cushion upon it, made from the skins 
of humans. Keijima Caoimhe is here. Nehemiah, Storm Magician is here. Malapardis
the Murderer is here. Devlin Morindar is here. Grek is here. He wields a steel 
claymore in both hands. Tonni D'Turano is here. He wields an ornate steel

You tell Nehemiah, Storm Magician in Moredhel, "Indeed."

Nehemiah, Storm Magician gives you a large gold ring with a central ruby.

Soft gold so pure it is almost orange has been used to create this large and impressive ring. Designed for the male hand, the band is wide and sturdy, the edges curled slightly to rest against the finger and leave a smooth edge. Clasped in the center in an ornate claw fixture is a large ruby. The stone is perfectly polished, glinting and glimmering to attract the eye each time the wearers hand moves. Perfectly made, this ring is a symbol of wealth and a skilled craftsman.

"Cast from a loop of iron, this ring has been smooted internally, to allow for a comfortable fit, but the outer edge seems almost unfinished. A harsh piece of jewellry, it bears a single rough cut ruby placed in the center."

Nehemiah, Storm Magician says in Moredhel, "I'm quite fond of it."

You tell Malapardis the Murderer in Moredhel, "Thanks."
