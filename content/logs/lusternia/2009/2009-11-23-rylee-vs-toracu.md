Crystal clear waters within Shadowvale River. (lost) (Shadowvale Arena.)
The shadowy outline of a twisted forest casts a dark gloom here. The water in 
this part of the river is surprisingly clear given the muddied waters to the 
north and the thin river to the southeast. Coming from the northwest, the icy 
cold waters mix with the main flow of the river, creating a cool and crisp 
current that flows at the bottom of the rocky divide between the Wyrden woods 
and Sylvan forest.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and northwest.

Entering a sloping tunnel. (Shadowvale Arena.)
The shadows have been gathered here. As the path continues to the north, the 
worn smoothness disappears, replaced by a damp, uneven surface strewn with 
roots and pebbles. The air is cooler here, though not as dank and humid as the 
deeper tunnels promise. To the south, the sounds of forest creatures can be 
heard above the whistle of the breeze as it blows around the passage's mouth. A 
foreboding silence marks the passage in the opposite direction. An icewall is 
here, blocking passage to the north. A graceful tree stands here, shaped 
vaguely like the form of a woman. Shadow Toracu Sae'Garoux, Ward of the Wyrd is 
here. He wields a flying dragon klangaxe with both hands.
