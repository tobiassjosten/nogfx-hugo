Avechna whispers in your mind that Lekius is now fair game to slay.
Lekius plays an argentine lyre of the forest, and you cry out as your deaf ears open up to the sound of a high-pitched note.
Your ears open up, though you lose your true hearing. (earache) (truehearing)

The Aetherware Shoppe. (lost) (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The long, narrow room has been cut into the granite rock in a sharp rectangular shape. Light from the beeswax candles hanging from the iron candelabrum on the ceiling provide enough light to view the wide variety of doors that line the walls. They range from simple pine to sumptuous oak and walnut, from iron wrought doors to massive reinforced steel bulwarks. At the end of the shoppe is a glass cabinet containing the precious spheres and cubes that glitter and churn with inner energies, each waiting for an owner to release their potential dimensional bubbles from which aether manses are formed. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by five pale ancestral spirits. You see a sign here instructing you that WARES is the command to see what is for sale.
You see exits leading south (open door) and up (open door).

The Aetherplex Chamber. (lost) (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The spherical chamber is formed from a hollow geode comprised of dozens of precious gemstones. Large jagged formations of rubies, sapphires, diamonds and emeralds line the walls and ceiling. The floor has been cut and polished to a brilliant shine, revealing concentric circles of brilliant colours. Upon close examination of the glassy floor, shimmering reflections briefly glide across its smooth surface of wondrous mansions and abodes. A current of electricity continuously runs throughout this mineral wonder, causing tiny sparks to erratically blossom up and down the crystalline formations. A stone of jade glitters on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Brother Zaralesis Starleaf is here. He wields a platinum-etched steel tahto with both hands.

Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right.

The Stairs of the Last Nine. (road). (Avechna's Peak.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Below the soaring majesty and thoughtful mystery of Avechna's Peak, a path unfolds and spirals up the mountain's sides, interspersed by rough-hewn stairs. Undertaking the path's journey up that path is an intimidating venture, for its length is long and the end lost beyond the clouds. This intimidation, however, proves paltry in the face of the mountain's hypnotic story of how the mortal races stood against insurmountable odds. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by five pale ancestral spirits.

The Stairs of the Last Nine. (road). (lost) (Avechna's Peak.?)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Below the soaring majesty and thoughtful mystery of Avechna's Peak, a path unfolds and spirals up the mountain's sides, interspersed by rough-hewn stairs. Undertaking the path's journey up that path is an intimidating venture, for its length is long and the end lost beyond the clouds. This intimidation, however, proves paltry in the face of the mountain's hypnotic story of how the mortal races stood against insurmountable odds. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by five pale ancestral spirits.
You see exits leading southwest and up.

This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Rising so far that clouds obscure its form, the majestic mountain touches the heavens above. The landscape practically radiates a sense of wonderment at the landmark, while the path holds a quiet reserve with sounds seeming dull and distant. Beautiful, dark granite flecked with glittering bits of mica makes the trail and has been worn smooth by the passing of countless pilgrims. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right.

Road to Avechna's Peak. (road). (Avechna's Peak.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. There is a maelstrom of rainbow colours whipping violently around. This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Light puffs of dust rise from the path at the slightest provocation and are cast to the mountain breeze. The dusty trail stretches onward to the base of the peak, where it can be seen rising to wind up and around the monument on a long trek to the top. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. High Priestess Celina d'Murani is here. She wields a golden webbed klangaxe with both hands. Lekius L'Eternae, the Artform is here, shrouded. He wields an argentine lyre of the forest in his left hand and an emblazoned hunter's shield in his right. He is surrounded by five pale ancestral spirits.
You see exits leading north and southwest.

Lekius plays an argentine lyre of the forest and directs the disharmonic notes towards you.
The reverberating sound echoes through your head, pounding you with excruciating pain.
As the sound builds up and explodes within your head, you die screaming in pain.
You have been slain by Lekius.
