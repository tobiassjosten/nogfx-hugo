Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (road). (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear water. The inside of this small cottage is actually somewhat friendlier than the bleak exterior would suggest, but no less dilapidated. The wooden floorboards are worn, with splinters around the edges, whilst the stone walls are missing small pieces. The ceiling overhead, once painted white, is now filled with small cracks across each of the wooden boards. Despite this, the room is fairly tidy, a coat-stand by the pinewood door holding several jackets and a large chest on the other side open and filled with clothes and linen. Sounds of a roaring fire crackle from the north, whilst it is possible to see a small kitchen to the west. A small table by the kitchen door allows a vase of dying flowers to be displayed for all visitors. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A mutated mutt crawls along the floor here. A philosopher's stone rests on the ground, gleaming with power.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

You find yourself sitting before a campfire, surrounded by a host of laughing friends. A traveller in a hooded cloak approaches the fire from the road, playing a melancholy tune on his wooden lute. You and your friends look at each other, dismayed that the stranger has brought such sorrow to your revelry. All of a sudden, he points at you, and all around you shifts to black, your friends disappearing into the darkness. Only the light from the fire remains for you to see the visitor standing over you. His grim face turns down to you, and he says in a low voice, "It is time."

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A pile of rubble lies here, blocking the way northeast. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, shrouded. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, marred by a black miasma. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, marred by a black miasma. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.

Fringe of the Vernal Forest. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The footpath leading in from the west becomes less and less clear as it transitions into the lush green floor of the Vernal Forest. The trees along the edge of the woods are not very numerous, but a glance to the northeast tells of a sudden change in that. Glowing glyphs hang in the air here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. A gorgeous, white stag with creamy white wings wanders about here, his head held regally. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Kalas Alianna is here, marred by a black miasma. She wields an athame dagger in her left hand and a golden sunburst shield in her right.
You see exits leading northeast and west.

As the void slams shut, she screams in abject terror, and you cannot help but watch in fascination as her soul is ripped asunder from her body.
[[ For no mere mortal can resist the evil of the Thriller! ]]
The ominous silence lifts as your concentration is broken.
You have slain Alianna.
Alianna leaves to the ether, emanating an aura of immense power.
You look around triumphantly and realize you are the last one standing. You have WON the combat free-for-all.
