A fountain of sparkling motes of light erupts at your feet.
The light whisks you away, unceremoniously dumping you at the feet of Narsrim.
-Map Removed-
Ornately carved room.
A sickly sweet odour, the smell of decomposing corpses, wafts in from a war shrine of Fain nearby. A long rusty chain dangles from the ceiling here. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the south. Narsrim D\'cente` towers here, folding the spatial fabric to travel. He wields a darkwood mandolin encased in iron filigree and bone in his left hand and a Wand of Illusions in his right.
You see a single exit leading south.
Tilting his head upward, the bound salamander stares in your direction with its artificial eyes, sobbing violently as it begs for release.
