Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The ground here is littered with small rocks, some razor sharp, poking up all around. The air is hot and dry, and the loose dirt that blows around on the ground is direct evidence of the complete lack of plants and water in the area. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.

A field of rocks. (lost) (Blasted Land.?)
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. The ground here is littered with small rocks, some razor sharp, poking up all around. The air is hot and dry, and the loose dirt that blows around on the ground is direct evidence of the complete lack of plants and water in the area. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.
You see exits leading east and south.

This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The area is filled with the foul stench of a decaying pond that rests on the surface of the wasteland here. Dead plants and the corpse of a small animal float on the surface of the water, decomposing in the heat. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.

A field of rocks. (lost) (Blasted Land.?)
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The ground here is littered with small rocks, some razor sharp, poking up all around. The air is hot and dry, and the loose dirt that blows around on the ground is direct evidence of the complete lack of plants and water in the area. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.
You see exits leading east and south.

Dense grove near the river. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. The trees are especially thick here, and as if to guard the heart of the forest that seems to lie to the west. The sound of water can be heard to the north, although the river is unseen through the dense trees. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here.

A field of rocks. (lost) (Blasted Land.?)
This location is flooded with deep, crystal blue water. The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The ground here is littered with small rocks, some razor sharp, poking up all around. The air is hot and dry, and the loose dirt that blows around on the ground is direct evidence of the complete lack of plants and water in the area. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here. Thrusting his gleaming ivory tusks in the air, a fluffy haired mammoth with enormous ears stomps about here. Admiral Narsrim D'cente`, Prince of the Lord is here, shrouded. He wields a coral staff in his left hand.
You see exits leading east and south.

With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here.

Seres river surrounded by wasteland. (Klangratch Tourny Fields.)
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. The river here is muddy, gathering dirt and wearing away rocks as it flows through the bleak, dry fields that stretch as far as the eye can see. Banks on either side of the river permit landing on the parched wasteland. With dark grey eyes, a lithe wyvern with topaz butterfly wings prowls around here.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, south, and west.
