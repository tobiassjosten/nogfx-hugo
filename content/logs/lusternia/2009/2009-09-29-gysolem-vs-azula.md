A stagnant pond.
A duststorm rages here. Occasional drops of rain fall to the ground from a sky grey with pregnant clouds. The area is filled with the foul stench of a decaying pond that rests on the surface of the wasteland here. Dead plants and the corpse of a small animal float on the surface of the water, decomposing in the heat. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. A pile of rubble lies here, blocking the way west. Priestess Azula Vivalde, Sexton of the Holy Forge is here, shrouded. She wields a golden sunburst shield in her left hand and a flaming symbol of purity in her right.
You see a single exit leading west.
