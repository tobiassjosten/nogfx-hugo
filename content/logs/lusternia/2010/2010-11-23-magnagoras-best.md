A torrent of poisonous fumes and sharp rocks hurtle at you from the north.
Following your body's death your spirit begins to escape, passing from your mortal body. With a 
cruel smile, Fillin grasps at you, a blind panic filling you before you manage to escape.
The poisonous fumes too much for you to handle, blood gushes forth from your mouth before you fall 
to the ground, your lifeless body twitching and spasming.
You have been slain by Fillin.
The song "Warsong" ends and fades away.
A horehound blossom falls out of your inventory.
A bog myrtle leaf falls out of your inventory.
