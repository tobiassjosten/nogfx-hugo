You scent at the air, your skilled nose picking up the faint traces of others in the surrounding area.
You make out the scent of Xenthos coming from winds of change.
You make out the scent of Narynth coming from winds of change.
You make out the scent of Urazial coming from twisting pathway into the wyrden mists.

Winds of change.
Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky. A birch sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. Spirit Warden Xenthos An'Ryshe, the Ebon Strategist is here. He wields a baleful rapier of darkened steel in each hand. Narynth Ysav'rai towers here, shrouded. She wields a mystic cudgel in her left hand and a wyrden shield with the image of a drum in her right.
You see exits leading north, southeast, and southwest.

A slaugh strokes a cold, beautiful finger across your cheek, and a cold sweat breaks out upon your brow.

Urazial's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
A jet black spider with a deadly stinger gazes intently at you, and you feel yourself drawn into his eyes, which swirl about in a kaleidoscopic array of swirling colours. Your vision slowly fades into nothing but curiously floating purple spots.
You are afflicted with BLACKEDOUT.
-

Your senses return to you as the blackout ends.

The sharp pain in your foot from the weapon pinning it to the ground makes you incapable of anything other than thinking of escaping it.

With a focused look, Xenthos strikes at you with a baleful rapier of darkened steel. Xenthos strikes deep into your right foot, pinning it down with a baleful rapier of darkened steel. You involuntarily crumple to a crouch and can think of nothing but freeing your impaled foot.

WOUNDS TO RIGHT_LEG

Urazial plays a glittering blackthorn lyre and directs the disharmonic notes towards you.
The reverberating sound echoes through your head, pounding you with excruciating pain.

A brownie bound in shadows runs up and tickles your sides.
A banshee bound in shadows stares at you, then suddenly emits a high-pitched screech at you. The soundwaves pierce into your very being, weakening you in both body and mind.
A redcap slashes you with a thin razor, causing blood to spurt from the wound, which he soaks up with his little cap.
A slaugh strokes a cold, beautiful finger across your cheek, and a cold sweat breaks out upon your brow.
280h, 4651m, 6041e, 10p, 26660en, 28405w ekbp-<22:59:01.810>

Your limbs begin to jerk and shake uncontrollably, and you begin to foam at the mouth.

Narynth pops something into her mouth, and rolls it around in her cheek. She cups a fist against her mouth and spits a sickly green beetle at you, which burrows into your flesh.

Xenthos gives his weapon a vicious twist and withdraws it from your body in a shower of blood.

Viynain raises his arms to the sky, as an incandescent glow surrounds him.
In a brilliant ray of light, the power of the Moon lashes down upon you.
280h, 4651m, 6041e, 10p, 26660en, 28405w ekbp-<22:59:02.418>

The ache in your ear canals clears up.
A soft moan rises up from the ground as a shadowy bubble forms around Urazial.
A soft moan rises up from the ground as a shadowy bubble forms around Narynth.
A soft moan rises up from the ground as a shadowy bubble forms around Xenthos.
The beat of the music pounds into your head, and you cannot stop yourself from dancing wildly to the rhythm.

Black Shuck, the Darkhound barks piercingly at you, the concussion of the sound causing your muscles to lock up.

Some insect has crawled up your throat and into your mouth. You gag and spit out a sickly green beetle.
You have been slain by Narynth.
YOU DIED LOSER TRY HARDER NEXT TIME
The mortal threads of your being severed, you scream in agony as the Divine spark within you enfolds your body with scorching flames.
On the edge of the abyss.
You see a single exit leading down.
