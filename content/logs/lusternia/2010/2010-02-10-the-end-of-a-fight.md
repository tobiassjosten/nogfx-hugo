Muttering words of power, you poke your index finger towards Ixion and make a hooking gesture. Invisible energies slam against Ixion, ripping apart his magical shield of protection.

Guards eyeing the tents. (lost) (Faethorn Realm.)
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. Superimposed over this location, an ethereal forest reaches up to the sky. Ethereal eyeballs float about, careful watchers that eye everyone and everything that passes this way. Encircling the tents within their centre, the guardians take careful notice of anything unfamiliar and blink rapidly to clear the dust and sand flying about everywhere. Thin, short leashes keep them away from the communal path although they cluster eagerly at the utmost ends of their chains to examine those that walk nearby. An oak sapling clings tenaciously to the ground here. Supreme Commander Kalas Ixion, Planeswalker is here, shrouded. He wields an unadorned darksteel rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading northeast, southeast, and west.
