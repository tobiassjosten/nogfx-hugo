Entrance to the northern spire.
A faint acrid smell lingers in the cavernous atrium of this coral spire and faint wisps of mist seem to seep from the surrounding walls. The coral walls of the atrium are cracked in several places which serve as footholds for an unrecognizable species of creeper vine to infest the once-magnificent entranceway. The vine itself appears to be the source of the acrid smell, as the leaves are browned and aged, though it appears to be healthy and thriving in this environment. Several objects lie hidden under the thick mass of vines which create a difficult path to navigate to reach the base of a curved metal staircase that twists up the side of the atrium. The vines carpet the floor until reaching the curved archway to the south. There, the vines abruptly stop, as if some invisible force holds the fiendish growth at bay. Brother Neal of Gebkuil is here. He wields a turquoise tahto of tumultuous tides with both hands.
You see exits leading southeast, southwest, and up.
