 (Clan): Anisu  says, "You didn't even know her :(."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "We spoke once or twice, actually. <_<."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Esoneyuna only ever talked to Rika and then Rika left for glooom."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Psh."
(Clan): Casilu  says, "No, I think you tried to talk to me when I was kidnapping fae."
(Clan): Anisu  says, "Nope casi."
(Clan): Anisu  says, "She doesn't talk to strangers."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "And they don't come any stranger than me..."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "Bet she would talk to me. :>."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "I bet :P."
(Clan): Casilu  says, "Would you give her candy and lure her into a windowless van?"
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "She also hates city dwellers :p."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Raised by Sarrasri and all that."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Nymnym doesn't ever talk to me anymore."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "No, I would seduce the shit out of her."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "No one talks to me anymore."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "And I haven't been playing, lovely. I had a bit of a meltdown."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Because I am now boring."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "I'm trying new medication though."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "And rika stop hating meeeee."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "You're mean."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "And made Nymnym hate me somehow :(."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Only cause I love you."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Rika, this is like second grade."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Anisu is only mean because she likes you."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Exactly!"
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Psh."
(Clan): Casilu  says, "Anisu should go pull her hair and throw bugs at her."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Does that mean Nymnym <3 me? :D."
(Clan): Anisu  says, "But you are chasing me right in to the camp of doman :(."
(Clan): Nymerya  says, "Of course I do."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "With a deep, abiding passion."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Yay."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Doo dee dum."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Ask."

 (Clan): Rika  says, "Nymnym, you're mine I thought :(."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "*jealous*."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "I have an alt!"
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Where?"
(Clan): Rika  says, "But you said you <3 me."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "Hallifax."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Race?"
(Clan): Anisu  says, "Rika we all love eachother!"
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Eww."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "Still viscanti until I decide what I want to be."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Go a way."
 (Clan): Rika  says, "Away*."
(Clan): Anisu  says, "Don't deny it :(."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "It huuurts."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Would likely need to wait, then. Casilu is a horrible racist against Viscanti, Illithoid, and Dracnari."
(Clan): Anisu  says, "Doesn't want Serens, doesn't want hallifaxians that are viscanti illithoid or dracnari."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "You are awfully picky."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "No Serens, Mags, Gaudis, not those three races, and Glooms won't marry me, anyway."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "Kek, no one will have heard of her, so I could be sneaky and reincarnate while no one was looking! But yeah, I need to actually play her. I think I'll go trill. Pity they're not pretty."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "You clearly don't have a wing fetish."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "Someone needs to adopt her."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Only Rika is capable of that from the people here."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "I'm the only one here to be kicked from a family. And twice."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "Solanis is too young."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Oh hi."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "We can age him."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "I didn't notice you there with my amazing age-changing powers."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "I didn't know you could do it. >.> I've not been playing, remember?"
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Oh right."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "On a different note should I go researcher."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "You not in my guild? Sure."
(Clan): Casilu  says, "Just kidding."
(Clan): Casilu  says, "Do whatever you want."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Psylisa wants to go mag, wonder how long before we declare war on them."
(Clan): Anisu  says, "Or serenwilde for that matter."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Did you know Arel joined gloom against Serenwilde :p."
(Clan): Casilu  says, "What did he do?"
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Not entirely sure since esoneyuna was resurgem covening but he was called out as a raider."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Wow..."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Well and miciah of course but he is leaving for celest anyway."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Left."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "He orghops more than me."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "You can't orghop now anyway."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "No?"
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "What place would still want you :p."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "I could go to Gaudi."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "And love gregori long time huh."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "He is okay with me. <_<."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Not like the leadership here."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Well, the Elostianites, anyway."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "There is -leadership- here?"
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "And I might go to war against the Order of Lyreth..."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "And former Morgfyrians."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Wait what did lyrethians do?"
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Nothing... yet."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Hey no crusading against me :(."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "An ounce of prevention, Annie."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Oh and one good reason for not going mag, Nariah."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Even though she likes me for some reason."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "Yeah. >.>."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Why? What did she do now?"
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "She makes all these writing tasks :(."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "I don't go in her guild, so no writing for me."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Heck, I don't even do guild tasks. <_<."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "I just contest and win leadership so I don't have to do shit."
XD XD
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "Great minds, Nymerya."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "So long as I'm in the Sentinels, I don't need a city or guild favour."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "Yes but anyone that entrusts guildmaster to me should weight down their bodies and jump of a cliff."
 (Clan): Nymerya  says, "I've been GM or GA in three different guilds and over two chars. All up I've led a guild 7 times, I think."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "I wanted ga :(."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "But alas no time."
 (Clan): Casilu  says, "I've been a GM twice and a GC once. I still have yet to want an elected position."
 (Clan): Anisu  says, "I was thinking of taking esoneyuna to glom since I have never had a non novice in glom
