Hall of redwood.
The area is suffused with an eerie, deep blue light, signifying a healing 
shrine of Elostian nearby. This location is flooded with shallow, crystal clear
water. This simple hall has been built entirely of wood from the redwood tree. 
A deep red glow envelops the room, rising from the polished floor. Within the 
center of the room a bundle of redwood saplings have been placed upon a concave
iron slat. The ends of the saplings burn slowly, the strong scent of the 
redwood filling the air. A small cask sits in the corner of the room filled 
with the ash of burnt saplings. A painting of Mitran is proudly exhibited on a 
nearby wall. Seeking enlightenment, a monk disciple stands here in his grey 
robes. Crackling with blue lightning, the Handmaiden of Shakiniel hovers in the
air here. Father Talkan, Hand of the Even-Blade is here. He wields a holy 
symbol of the light in his left hand and a silver scaled shield emblazoned with
crossed blades in his right.
