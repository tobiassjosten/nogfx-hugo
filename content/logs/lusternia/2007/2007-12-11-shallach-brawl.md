The Catacomb Gate.
This large stone room is dominated by the tall Catacomb Gate. Stretching twice the height of a man and the width of four healthy steeds, the
gate is made of thick, twisted black iron. Beautifully wrought, the iron barrier separates the upper catacombs from the harsh depths 
beneath, which are depicted in various symbols of warning that are soldered to the gate. A massive lock joins the two halves of the barrier 
together with such strength that only the right key could allow access to the danger beyond. The catacomb gate key lies on the ground here 
sparkling. A pile of golden sovereigns twinkles and gleams.
You see exits leading south and down (closed door).

Underground passage.
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. An ornate iron fixture protrudes from the wall here, bearing in its intricate grasp a
blazing torch. The torchlight finds few cracks in the floors and walls in which to cast shadows. A dark slit in the roof hangs directly 
above a line of circular holes in the floor and a crank in the wall leads to an unseen mechanism. Next to the crank is a small diagram 
explaining that when the crank is turned, bars will descend and seal the inner passageways from intruders who have penetrated this far into 
Shallach. An ur'dead knight of Shallach stands here clad in spectral armor that radiates darkness. Drill Sergeant, Baron Vathael Feyranti, 
Silver and Cold is here. He wields a bladed scimitar resembling flame in each hand.

Underground passage.
Shafts of blue light form crisscrossing patterns here. An ornate iron fixture protrudes from the wall here, bearing in its intricate grasp a
blazing torch. The torchlight finds few cracks in the floors and walls in which to cast shadows. A dark slit in the roof hangs directly 
above a line of circular holes in the floor and a crank in the wall leads to an unseen mechanism. Next to the crank is a small diagram 
explaining that when the crank is turned, bars will descend and seal the inner passageways from intruders who have penetrated this far into 
Shallach. An ur'dead knight of Shallach stands here clad in spectral armor that radiates darkness. A taint wyrm is coiled on the ground 
here, spoiling the air with its corrosive stench. Death Trooper Ralek, Blade of the Keeper is here. He wields a vicious katana in his left

Assembly hall.
Wide, sparse pillars support the roof of this meeting hall as it stretches off to the west. The vast open area allows for a huge host of 
orclach to receive instructions and sermons. Along the walls are bright torches that illuminate the meeting hall and the passageways leading
away from it into other parts of the catacombs. An ur'dead knight of Shallach stands here clad in spectral armor that radiates darkness. A 
huge archdemon looms here, surrounded by black mist. Drill Sergeant, Baron Vathael Feyranti, Silver and Cold is here. He wields a bladed 
scimitar resembling flame in each hand. Balizar is here. He wields a bloody symbol of pain in his left hand and an iron shield in his right.
Saddim Halfdansson, The Guardian is here, shrouded. He wields a twisted staff in his left hand and a gold and iron buckler shield in his 
right.
You see exits leading north (open door), southeast, west, and northwest (open door).

Assembly hall.
Wide, sparse pillars support the roof of this meeting hall as it stretches off to the east. The vast open area allows for a huge host of 
orclach to receive instructions and sermons. Along the walls are bright torches that illuminate the meeting hall and the passageways leading
away from it into other parts of the catacombs. A huge archdemon looms here, surrounded by black mist. The twisted remains of Balizar lie 
here. The soul of Balizar roams the land, bodiless. Drill Sergeant, Baron Vathael Feyranti, Silver and Cold is here. He wields a bladed 
scimitar resembling flame in each hand. Saddim Halfdansson, The Guardian is here, shrouded. He wields a twisted staff in his left hand and a

Assembly hall.
Wide, sparse pillars support the roof of this meeting hall as it stretches off to the east. The vast open area allows for a huge host of 
orclach to receive instructions and sermons. Along the walls are bright torches that illuminate the meeting hall and the passageways leading
away from it into other parts of the catacombs. A huge archdemon looms here, surrounded by black mist. The twisted remains of Balizar lie 
here. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. Drill Sergeant, Baron Vathael Feyranti, Silver and 
Cold is here. He wields a bladed scimitar resembling flame in each hand. The soul of Balizar roams the land, bodiless.
You see exits leading east, south (open door), west, and northwest.

Assembly hall.
Wide, sparse pillars support the roof of this meeting hall as it stretches off to the east. The vast open area allows for a huge host of 
orclach to receive instructions and sermons. Along the walls are bright torches that illuminate the meeting hall and the passageways leading
away from it into other parts of the catacombs. A huge archdemon looms here, surrounded by black mist. The twisted remains of Balizar lie 
here. A sickly black cloud of filth pollutes the air, buzzing with bloated green flies. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. The soul of 
Balizar roams the land, bodiless. Drill Sergeant, Baron Vathael Feyranti, Silver and Cold is here. He wields a bladed scimitar resembling 
flame in each hand. Saddim Halfdansson, The Guardian is here, shrouded. He wields a twisted staff in his left hand and a gold and iron 
buckler shield in his right. Yrael is here. He wields a large darksteel round shield in his left hand.
