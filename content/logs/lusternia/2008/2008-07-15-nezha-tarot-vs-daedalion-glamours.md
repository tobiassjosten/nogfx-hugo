You toss the Hanged Man tarot card at Daedalion and as it reaches him, a huge mass of rope bursts out of it to entrap and hinder him.

"In the halls of Celestia, where the brave will live forever," you sing, making a harmonious earthy-brown lute fairly weep with tragic notes, and you look directly at Daedalion.
Surrounded by soft sapphire glow, Daedalion gazes hypnotically at some inner vision, his eyes widening and filling with tears.
Suddenly Daedalion's movements through the time stream are slowed.

A swirling void of darkness opens up before Daedalion, emanating a mad alien presence. He whimpers as tendrils of icy smoke leap out and bore into his body. As the void slams shut, he screams in abject terror, and you cannot help but watch in fascination as his soul is ripped asunder from his body.
The ominous silence lifts as your concentration is broken.
You have slain Daedalion.
The illusory glamour of Daedalion standing next to himself melts away.
Your karma falls in response to your deeds.
The song that Daedalion was performing fades away.
