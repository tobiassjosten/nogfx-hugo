MUSIC - OCTAVE

Syntax: PLAY OCTAVE SEMPRE (to build a maestoso)
        PLAY OCTAVE TACET (to remove a maestoso)
Power:  3 (Any)
This is an extremely powerful use of music, whereby a maestoso or a
single perfect note is created that holds all spiritual and some magical
vibrations in place. This is quite dangerous because it affects everyone
in the room, including the musician and his allies. If the musician
leaves the room, the note will die out or, alternatively, a rival
musician can silence the sound by playing a counterpoint. Those who can
hear will not be able to heal auric ailments of any type nor be able to
focus spirit.
