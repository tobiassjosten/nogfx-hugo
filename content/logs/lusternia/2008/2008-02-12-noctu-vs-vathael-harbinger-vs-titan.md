With a powerful lunge, Vathael strikes at you with a bladed scimitar resembling flame. Vathael strikes your forehead, causing blood to flow into your eyes and coat your entire face.
SlicedForehead
Your deadly, poisonous blood splashes across Vathael, who recoils as his skin hisses and melts.
A prickly stinging overcomes your body, fading away into numbness.

With a heavy overhand stroke, Vathael slams a bladed scimitar resembling flame down upon you. Vathael hacks your neck, and blood fountains out in a thick spray.
The blade shears through your body before coming clean through the other side with a strangely quiet swish, momentarily surprising you with its force, before you feel distinctly unwell and collapse to the ground.
You have been slain by Vathael.
You come back into focus as the blur illusion vanishes.
You become visible once more.
The song "First" ends and fades away.
A plug of coltsfoot falls out of your inventory.
