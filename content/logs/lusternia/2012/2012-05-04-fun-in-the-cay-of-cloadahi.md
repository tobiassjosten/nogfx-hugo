beneath in a gentle spray of curling leaves and tangled vines. Long slivers of marble lie on the 
sand nearby, remnants from a once-grand embellishment above. There are 3 luminous purple spined 
starfish here. A chitinous crimson crab scuttles about here, claws clicking. A stinking noxious

Passing a spiralling tower. (Cay of Cloadahi)
There is a maelstrom of rainbow colours whipping violently around. The corrosiveness of the taint 
sickens the land. It is quite mild. A grand, spiralling tower rises to the east, pristine white 
marble exquisitely carved and shaped to ascend high above the main structure of the ruins. Against 
its base, lush greenery has sprung forth low to the ground, obscuring the sand beneath in a gentle 
spray of curling leaves and tangled vines. Long slivers of marble lie on the sand nearby, remnants 
from a once-grand embellishment above. There are 3 luminous purple spined starfish here. A chitinous 
crimson crab scuttles about here, claws clicking. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. There are 2 
sparkleberries in 2 groups here. A bunch of pennyroyal lies on the ground. The twisted remains of 
Xazlael lie here. Merciful Judge Saoirse Val'Andra lingers here, bursts of multicoloured light 
randomly exploding in and out of existence around her. She wields a radiant symbol of love in her 
left hand. Red Hand Alacardael waits here, skeins of resinous smoke curling languidly about his 
figure in flickering, coppery tongues of light and shadow. He wields Gauntlets of Transformation in 
his left hand and a metal treebark shield in his right.
You see exits leading north and west.
