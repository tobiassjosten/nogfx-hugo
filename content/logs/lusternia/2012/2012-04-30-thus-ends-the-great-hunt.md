The perception of time momentarily slows to a fraction as Atropos snips stray strands and frayed threads upon the Tapestry of Fate, each cut bringing a distant scream. Time rushes forward as the memory fades, yet you retain the knowledge that your fate in Lusternia is far from meeting its end.

Amidst a few tired though enthusiastic blasts of their horn, hunters from around Lusternia begin to make the long trek home, slapping each other on the back and sharing tales of derring-do. Thus ends the Great Hunt!

A swirl of frigid frost drives the temperature lower as a tubby snow phoenix with icy wings soars into view from the ether.

As Ushaara leaves to the out, the sense of stern authority lifts from the area.

The Aetherplex Chamber.
The spherical chamber is formed from a hollow geode comprised of dozens of precious gemstones. Large jagged formations of rubies, sapphires, diamonds and emeralds line the walls and ceiling.The floor has been cut and polished to a brilliant shine, revealing concentric circles of brilliant colours. Upon close examination of the glassy floor, shimmering reflections briefly glide across its smooth surface of wondrous mansions and abodes. A current of electricity continuously runs throughout this mineral wonder, causing tiny sparks to erratically blossom up and down the crystalline formations. Shimmering with aetheric energy, a bright glowing portal floats here in midair. In the shape of an open palm, a metallic sigil lies here. A giant bat 
hangs here, wings folded about its body and one beady eye open. There are 2 great brindle mastiffs here. A giant black widow studies you carefully from her web. Curled up in a ball, Milla the Peppermint Kitten rests here. The decapitated head of Delphas has been carelessly tossed aside. Miciah n'Kylbar, the Bearer of Gorlityn lingers here, surrounded by a bloody, 
cloying haze. He wields Gorlityn the Tainted in his left hand and a winged star-crested greatshield in his right. You see a sign here instructing you to use the PORTAL command to enter the aetherplex system. There is an aetherways portal here.You see exits leading north (open door), south, out, and through a bright, glowing portal.
