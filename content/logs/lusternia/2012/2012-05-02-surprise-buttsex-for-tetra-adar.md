His blue feathered tail curling between four fearsome legs, a magnificent chimaera with shimmering wings of snowy feathers crouches quietly within his surroundings. Ambassador Tetra Adar is riding on a magnificent chimaera with shimmering wings of snowy feathers. She wields an amethyst temporal resonator in her left hand and a ruby vial in her right. You see a sign here instructing you to use the PORTAL command to enter the aetherplex system.
There are no obvious exits.

Focusing on her head, you strike at Tetra with an ornate platinum rapier. You cleanly strike off her scalp, revealing the bloody skull underneath.

Letting an ornate platinum rapier droop, you suddenly heave it up at Tetra. You hack into her gut, which opens up and pours blood in a pool at her feet.

Tetra bows her head and closes her eyes, then glows with a sparkling silver light. As Tetra's wounds heal, her face becomes worn and drawn.

Tetra, riding a magnificent chimaera with shimmering wings of snowy feathers, leaves to the ether.
A magnificent chimaera with shimmering wings of snowy feathers prowls out to the ether, his nasty, barbed tail swinging dangerously behind him.

(Seekers of the Crimson Eye): You say, "I -love- order tasks!"
(Seekers of the Crimson Eye): Adrienne says, "Heheh."

You sense the piercing eyes of Tetra looking upon you.

It is now the 3rd of Tzarin, 295 years after the Coming of Estarra.

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "That's for your asault on Lady Kalikai, in case you wondered."

Tetra tells you, "What are you talking about? I've never even met Kalikai, let alone assaulted her."

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "Yet somehow, you ended up enemied to Her."

Tetra tells you, "Yes. Four months after raiding Vortex, someone thought it was smart to enemy me to Kalikai."

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "There ya go. Raiding vortex, did your party happen to take down a shrine there?"

Tetra tells you, "We didn't, actually. You're lucky my reflexes weren't up."

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "Perhaps. If it's luck, I'll take it."

Tetra tells you, "Well, your luck is about to run short."

Tetra tells you, "If it had been anywhere else, I would've looked over it. But you stomped on my family's home. That's unforgivable."

Nelras has been permanently preserved in ice by Keeper of the Word, Neos Eli'Silar, Aquamantic Egomaniac.
You see the death occur at a central intersection.

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "The unnamed fulcrux?"

Tetra tells you, "It's an orphanage. For children, incase you didn't notice."

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "Eh, the children arent enemied to Kalikai."

Tetra tells you, "I'm sure Kalikai is a great role model to look up to, then."

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "I dont know her that well."

Tetra tells you, "Then your reason for coming in and making a mess are hollow."

Tetra tells you, "Especially considering enemies of Gaudiguch are forbidden from entering. I don't know how you got in."

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "I'm not an enemy of Gaudiguch."

Tetra tells you, "Enemy of Hallifax, rather."

Tetra tells you, "Come back again and I'll make you regret it. That isn't a threat, it's a promise."

You tell Ambassador Tetra Adar, "I'm absolutely intimidated."

Leta doffs a refractive crown of unicursal hexagrams cordially.

Leta grows still and her lips begin to move silently.

The body of Kerl appears in a flash and his soul descends to fill it, causing the previously expressionless face to fill with emotion.

Kerl sits himself down on a broad iron couch and makes himself comfortable.

Kerl is enveloped in translucent fire for a moment and is gone, his soul safe until he returns to Lusternia.

The body of Theoreticus Leta Mzithrei appears in a flash and her soul descends to fill it, causing the previously expressionless face to fill with emotion.

Leta leaves to the east.
A jade-armoured Wyvern Rider says, "For Freedom, Leta. Never forget the gift you've been given."

A cloud of rainbow smoke drifts in from the west, heady layers swirling upwards before condensing into Briaria.

Briaria fades away as she exhales a cloud of swirling, rainbow-hued smoke that drifts off to the east.

Luxanima has been cut down by a sabre-toothed cat.
