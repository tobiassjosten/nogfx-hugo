Moulded out of rainbow crystal, this ornate bell positively sings of opalescent light. Dreamy 
figments and indistinct figures shift between the bell's numerous facets. Golden filigree impresses 
against its sides, forming the holy symbol of the Forest Dreamer, while chasings of silver inscribe 
prayers and hymns speaking of the interconnected universe. At the heart of this marvelous item, a 
thin clapper of milky white coral hangs strangely still; however, a faint echo rings about the 
bell's mouth, whispering a chime reminiscent of the hum of creation. A chain of enchanted leaves 
twines around a coiled handle that allows this divine trinket to be worn around the neck.
It weighs 2 ounce(s).
It does not retain any heat whatsoever.
It bears the distinctive mark of Hoaracle, the Forest Dreamer.

open palm, a metallic sigil lies here. A giant bat hangs here, wings folded about its body and one 
beady eye open. There are 2 great brindle mastiffs here. A giant black widow studies you carefully

He is a compound-eyed kephera and he stands at roughly five and a half feet in height. He maintains 
his good posture at all times, never hunch-backed or stooping. Twin ebon antennae rise above his 
head, tense and still save for occasional twitches, denoting a habit of patience and watchfulness. 
Small barbs run along the edges of the thick plates of chitin thatform the shoulders, the chest, 
feet and even the delicate arrangement of chitin that constitutes the elbow. Those minute spikes are 
difficult to spot on his rippling black hide unless viewed in profile, each of them defining a body 
part with their protective points. An impressive musculature is imposed upon his body. He is wearing 
a canvas backpack, 2 etched turquoise rings, a platinum chain stud through his lower lip, a crimson 
hoop accented with fiery rubies through his upper lip and white leather robes with restraining 
buckles.

The Aetherplex Chamber.
The spherical chamber is formed from a hollow geode comprised of dozens of precious gemstones. Large 
jagged formations of rubies, sapphires, diamonds and emeralds line the walls and ceiling. The floor 
has been cut and polished to a brilliant shine, revealing concentric circles of brilliant colours. 
Upon close examination of the glassy floor, shimmering reflections briefly glide across its smooth 
surface of wondrous mansions and abodes. A current of electricity continuously runs throughout this 
mineral wonder, causing tiny sparks to erratically blossom up and down the crystalline formations. 
Shimmering with aetheric energy, a bright glowing portal floats here in midair. In the shape of an 
open palm, a metallic sigil lies here. A giant bat hangs here, wings folded about its body and one

5690h, 4788m, 5358e, 10p, 25920en, 21960w esSixkd<>-issue Tharok Tharok and Ethere are characters played by the same person, as well as the now
suicided Jabez. Tharok approached Anita in the Aetherplex and "gave her a message" from Ethere, who was Anita's protege at one point in time. I made a
 comment about Ethere in Tharok's presence, and amazingly, Tharok poofs and Ethere shows up, complaining about my comment.  This is a large breach of
HELP SECONDS, which this player has a terrible issue with. He commonly breaks this rule, mentioning his "friends" who told him to pass on messages, or
 logging onto an alternate character to flirt with a female who wasn't astounded by his wit and charm. When he doesn't get his way, he suicides
himself. I'm all for playing random characters, but this player gives us a bad name and needs to learn to keep his characters seperate.
Thank you, your issue has been submitted as #21.
Tharok has been notified and asked to submit a reply.
