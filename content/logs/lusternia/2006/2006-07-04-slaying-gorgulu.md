Though Gorgulu the Devourer of Souls is counted as among the Demon Lords of Nil,
there is nothing about this monstrosity that hints at having an intellect, at
least not one that is commonly understood as sentient. Also known as the Mouth
of a Thousand Hungers, Gorgulu is a seething, amorphous mass that surges with
corruption, filth and tainted putrescence. There always seems to be mouths of
various sizes and species that form and salivate upon the inchoate blob that is
Gorgulu. The mouths are fed by appendages that grow from the slime and pus,
often appearing as tentacles or giant tongues, but sometimes as fully formed
humanoids connected to Gorgulu by a cord, like half-aborted miscarriages.
Gorgulu the Devourer of Souls almost glows with nearly god-like power.
