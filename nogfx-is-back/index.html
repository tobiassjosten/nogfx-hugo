It was a very simple piece of software, where you could upload a log from your MUD gaming session, to more easily share your experience.</p><p>Kind of like a geekier predecessor to Twitch. (Except, for some reason, Amazon never offered <em>me</em> a nine-figure acquisition offer…)</p><p>Over the years I kept adding features – character verification, voting, commenting, etc. It was still all very basic, as is evident from these old screenshots of how it looked up until this year:</p><div class=row><div class=col><figure class="figure mb-0"><img src=nogfx.org-2006-home.png class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></figure></div><div class=col><figure class="figure mb-0"><img src=nogfx.org-2006-logs.png class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></figure></div></div><div class="figure-caption text-end mb-3">Design has never really been my forte but I'm happy with the improvement!</div><p>Regardless of the crappy looks and half-working features, people seemed to like the website. As time went by, together we managed to share more than 1500 logs and create over 3000 comments.</p><p>Then, life happened and I no longer had the time to play MUDs. While Nogfx kept living its own life, over time, stuff broke down and stopped working and the website saw an ever decreasing usage.</p><p>MUDding has a special place in my heart, though, having cut my teeth on coding for them, which turned into my professional career. I&rsquo;ve got so many fond memories from playing MUDs, meeting people from all over the world, and building something together.</p><p>Finding myself with a tiny bit of extra spare time recently, I decided to breathe new life into this project, revamping the website and hopefully making it even more useful for our community.</p><h2 id=new-design>New design</h2><p>As you might have noticed, this revamp started with a redesign of the website. I&rsquo;m by no means a good designer but at least I&rsquo;m better than I was one and a half decade ago, evident by the above screenshots.</p><figure class="figure mb-0"><img src=nogfx.org-2006-home.png class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><figcaption class="figure-caption text-end mb-3">REPLACE WITH NEW DESIGN</figcaption></figure><p>This new version of Nogfx supports everything essential from the old one, apart from some key features. Like adding new logs, votes, and comments. Anything that requires a costly database, really.</p><p>You can still add to it through <a href=https://github.com/tobiassjosten/nogfx-web>the open GitHub repo</a> but I&rsquo;ll make this work better, so you can upload your logs and discuss them directly here on the website. Plus, I&rsquo;ve got some ideas for how to take the logs archive to a whole new level but that&rsquo;ll be a surprise.</p><p>One other thing that&rsquo;s already vastly improved in this version is the load times. It used to take roughly two seconds for every page to load; over ten with the logs list. Reload this page and see the difference.</p><p>Speaking of surprises, btw, let&rsquo;s move on to the next piece of news.</p><h2 id=new-mud-client>New MUD client</h2><p>asdf</p><img src=/nogfx-client-screenshot.png class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><h2 id=new-content>New content</h2><p>guides</p><p>more metadata</p><p>streaming</p><p>more documentation</p><p>overall, making it easier to get into MUDs</p></div></main></div><div class="container-fluid block-breadcrumb"><main class=row><div class="col-8 offset-2 p-4"><p class="text-center fst-italic">Hey, want to share your expertise with the community? <a href=/contact/>Hit me up</a> and let's chat!</p></div></main></div><footer class=container-fluid><nav class="navbar navbar-expand mt-auto menu menu--footer"><ul class=navbar-nav><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/about/>About</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/contact/>Contact</a></li><li clas=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/subscribe/>Newsletter</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/scripts.a1d86fd05389408089936db7548d322fd53743e2b300b4ac3576ff374832e09ddef69905d283e7e348738ed47f32c0956064b26193320afb5f47e2a0ef16cc52.js integrity="sha512-odhv0FOJQICJk223VI0yL9U3Q+KzALSsNXb/N0gy4J3e9pkF0oPn40hzjtR/MsCVYGSyYZMyCvtfR+Kg7xbMUg=="></script></body></html>
