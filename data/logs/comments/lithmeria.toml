There are key differences mechanically however, such as wind, currents, a Sailing skill, and ship combat. And no, the geography of Lithmeria bears no resemblance at all to Evarayn's. We will be posting a world map at some point the future. Thank you for your interest, and you are welcome to further pursue the discussion on our forums, if you would like. "

Flick in Maneuvers (not decreasing the number of stance blows left) is a taste of what's to come on that front. Most of the stance manipulation is in the third tier, which wasn't revealed in this update."
