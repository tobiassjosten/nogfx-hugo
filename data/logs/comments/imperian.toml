In which case this issue is already confusing. However, to reply to the issue about an single jpk in caanae... First off all, Ahkan's player shouldn't speak about anything that he has no knowledge about. This issue seems more to me be a complain about Siath bashing or doing FFA's. Now.. Siath is Anti-magick, which makes it quite naturual for him to defend it and RP around it. The character Ahkan have also lately been very swift to enemy everyone from Ithaqua (Which Siath is a part of) to Khandava without any reason more then \"A group came and attacked us\". Now, once again... this issue is the typical \"I don't want to deal with it IC\" issue. I said it so many times before, ISSUES are not about single kills or attacks. Does Siath have a reason to kill Nanten, Ahkan, Insinyan, Jaskis? Of course! He is the Grand Master of Manoa, which also means that he is strictly bound to Antioch and her members. Ahkan's player apparently thinks that just because an hour passed you no longer have the right to attack him? And not to mention, as soon as Siath saw his guildmember and members of Antioch die, he went to mindlock Nanten, which Ahkan also noticed, otherwise I am confused to why they tried to prism to Siath. It's hard to make an very good response to an issue that contains complains over all different kinds of things, that has NOTHING to do with issues to begin with. And I would like Ahkan's player to show me WHEN I attacked 'magickers' to take \"their\" bashing areas. And seriously.. What does this even have to do with anything? Thank you"

Alitis has every right to re fuse Nearyku and as much as I think Alitis' character is a DBag to the majority of people, I agree with him that he has the right to refuse him. If you really want to get into a guild or organization, you just have to be willing to spend a pile of time being killed, waiting for referendums, or serving out your fine and time.

The other two got chewed out but, since it was false pretenses, I didn't punish them severely. For those who don't play Impy, this is considered a PK faux paux, especially in Stavenn which is a PK'r heavy city. Lots of people do it, true, but those people tend to be scorned when caught.\r\n\r\n-Nearyku was disfavoured and slain, then returned and tried to feign ignorance when he was leading the party. So I told him to go out and stand at the spring so every single person he has ever griefed can have just revenge. He decided to get snippy and try to claim that what was happening to him was unfair, I decided I didn't want him in the city anymore. Being enemied to Kragge and Stavenn is SOP for all non-citizens/non-guests, being enemied to the Diavlous was because I REALLY don't like Nearyku.\r\n\r\n-As far as whatever others are doing, I'm not omniscient, and I'm not on 24/7. Only reason I caught this was because I was in the right place at the right time. I'm hoping that by setting this example, people will realize if they TELL ME about this sort of thing, I'll actually take action.

Basically a thing that will, on the swing, impale+battlecry if your opponent has both Ciguatoxin (I would also include Hemotoxin so you know he hasn't just purged paralysis off) and Undeafness. In order to use this you need to be very confident in your Ciguatoxin tracking and in your ability to squeeze in a disembowel.

To fix the mending looping, would it be something as simple as changing it to, \"apply mending to leg\" instead of \"apply mending to legs\" in the date file? Because what I think, which might be totally wrong, is that it is apply mending as if I have two broken legs, so it applies it once, which heals my one broken leg and then again to heal the other leg, but since that leg is broken, it is wasted.

The administration likely took the view that in this case, Trez's use of the word wasn't a form of sexual harrasment because he was using it as a colloquialism for 'coward' and not as an inappropriate play on Indica's gender. If it helps you, flip the names and pretend Indica had called Trez a 'dick' and Trez had issued for \"sexual harassment.\" \r\n\r\nHad Indica issued for foul language, rather than sexual harrasment, her issue might have been upheld, though it's likely the admin would have seen it as far too petty to warrant anything beyond a stern message of reprimand from one of the Admin shells. \r\n\r\nYou could make the argument that the administration could have looked at the log, dismissed the 'sexual harassment' complaint and still punished Trez for the foul language. This didn't happen because it's been a longstanding unofficial policy of the administration to only punish instances of offensive language that are either incredibly public (market channel) or specifically complained against. The admin could certainly simply run a search function through their logs and throw up the names of everyone who has sworn in the last five years but it probably wouldn't be that productive a use of their time. To this end, they generally don't go off and punish foul language unless it's been specifically flagged as such. \r\n\r\nLots of love, \r\nSaggy"

However, you do not need deafness against a Wardancer so you can instead keep up blindness(If you're really that worried about being transfixed). As far as bind is concerned, it takes 1 rope and takes up balance if you can't bind them. Additionally, web tattoo takes EQ equivalent to your opponents writhe speed and in the case of bards/wardancers themselves, more than the opposing writhe EQ due to flexibility. The point stands that without paralysis triggering the condition for bind you'll have only Transfixation as a -reliable- writhe method to hold someone down because you cannot do -anything- but impale/disembowel once you've impaled them. They can still reliably sip/drink despite being impaled so... while it's a method to hold them down it is in no way reliable compared to say.. paralysis/bind. So... unless knockout, which has a shorter knockout period than the balance recovery -and- does not deliver a toxin -and- which is parryable, were to be increased to allow a reliable bind, or if -stun- actually did something beyond just stunning them (I think it should be parryable as well, as it is a free toxin with no repercussions to the WD) Then I would agree with you. I do agree though, poor wardancers because they already get so many cool toys. "

Ideally with hunters sitting out of room throwing axes and justicars sitting out of room spamming sunder, and amazons/wardens spamming broad arrows. That's outside of the city too. Inside it's not unrealistic to expect to be jumped by ten within 3 seconds of popping up on WHO lists and mindnets. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Indica is a high level, surcoat wearing cleric with a reasonable amount of combat experience. Reliably killing her quickly requires a decent sized group. Quick kills are what you want in a situation like this. \r\n\r\n2. (I don't think this is yours but still) EDIT: Also, this was from vodun travelling into Antioch sewers. Missed the beginning of the log where Enteri travels and emotes 'hi' to Indica.\r\n\r\nIndica probably didn't know about the vodun change, and how goodwill/illwill works now, or she forgot, otherwise she likely wouldn't have left guards. \r\n\r\n3. Or the end where the Trez wannabe squad made their announcement of fail.\r\n\r\nI guess there's no arguing taste, but I thought this was pretty cool. No doubt when you're a serious fighter leading your own assault team into the heart of enemy cities you'll come up with a much better catch-cry, but since I don't plan to be reading NoGFX in 2000-never, I'll miss out on it. \r\n\r\n4. But no, congratulations. For proving exactly how far Stavenn has fallen. Bravo.\r\n\r\nThis log featured teaming and catch-phrases, both of which have been used liberally by Stavenn (and everyone else) since about 8 minutes after release. \r\n\r\nLots of love, \r\n- Former Sagron/Palandrias"

And the reason why I'm really mad is that if Galt should be calling any guild useless, in my opinion, it should be the Lorekeepers. The Bard's guild is one of the more active guilds in the city, and it's members don't shrink from their duty of defending the city. Even though most of them have transed nothing, they still go out and fight. I can't say that of the Lorekeepers guild leader, or of most of the Lorekeepers in general. The Lorekeeper's are the official guards of Kinsarmar yet when I asked the leader for help, he said he couldn't and was gone by the time the raid was over.  I'm tempted to take up the profession so we actually have someone to vortex since their is never anyone up when we need it. I don't even know why the Bard's have such a bad reputation beyond the fact that there used to be a bunch of people who simply did mudsex all the time. It hasn't been like that in a long, long, time...And what really annoys me with Galt is that he doesn't even do anything constructive. He doesn't say you are doing this or this wrong, he just says, you suck and sleeps...and stirs up trouble with Celidon. They already don't help us s because Kinsarmar screws them over every time they help and Galt's prejudice against them doesn't help. *sigh*"

When I took Laethus anti-magick, everyone told me Monk was easy.  So I took it, mastered the profession, and found it to be the most difficult profession I've ever fought in.  I couldn't get around people's parry.  It was to the point I was ready to get the lvl 3 str arti and the lvl 3 monk arti so I could jab punch people to death.  Jab punches to straight damage without targeting a limb.  So yeah, that's what I was going to have to do to get headway.  I couldn't effectively fight summoners/hunters/outriders/druids because my fists couldn't hold a toxin.  So I went predator, not knowing much about them, thinking they're a toxin class because they make them.  I was wrong.  Go ahead, laugh, I don't care, but the other 2 professions in the game that make toxins and are a toxin using class, so if you can't see why I thought that might be the case with the other one then you're just trolling anyway.  So then I looked at a log of Zyran, saw that Wardancer was a good toxin class, and took it.  I don't know it all that well, but I like it.  Point being, every class has its pros and cons.  Bard was good for its passive stuff, but I could be beaten by a Mage every time.  I still to this day have never beaten a Mage.  Even after they got nerfed.  So we can all argue about which classes are 'real professions' or we can accept that some professions are easier for some people and not others.  "

So, probably you just took my post out of context. Thats why you were being retarded.\r\n\r\nBut, mostly you were being retarded because you assumed I had NO CLUE wtf I was talking about. Which along with wasting your time it pisses me off. If I don't understand something I will directly ask the question. Besides the fact that you know my character is Renac and you know that he is at least a few RL years old, knowing simple things like roomwide illusions and arena not using up resources are fairly basic things. Please don't take too much offense to me saying 'you were being retarded'. I just mean that if you had thought about it before posting you might have understood."

The gentle crackle of the fireplace mingles with the sound of Schubert’s No. 8 in B minor. Dias himself, in a fine silk smoking jacket and sporting a golden pipe forged from one of his many Olympic gold medals reclines in an opulent leather armchair and toys with his Harvard pin. For long minutes all is tranquility, until the sound of his phone shatters the stillness. \r\n\r\nPicking up his sixth generation Iphone, gifted to him by Steve Jobs for inventing telecommunications he confidently intoned, “Dias speaking.”\r\n\r\nA confident but supplicatory voice issued forth, “Lord Dias this is Barack Obama, I wonder if you had a moment?”\r\n\r\n“Please Barry, it was the British royal family I saved and the British who knighted me! It’s just Dias!” he responded generously. \r\n\r\n“Thank you, and thank you again for getting me elected, I think we both know the U.S was never going to be led by a black guy you didn’t vouch for,” gushed the President. \r\n\r\n“Think nothing of it, Obie, and I hope we’re still on for our weekly two on one basketball game this weekend. Maybe this week I’ll let you and LeBron score a basket on me…” \r\n\r\n“In my dreams Dias, in my dreams,” sighed Barack before continuing, “but I’m afraid this is a business call. Your country needs you Dias! Kabul desperately needs a medic who has never been to medical school for a two week tour, because apparently that’s how long we deploy people for now.”\r\n\r\n“Well sir, as long as it in no way interferes with my bashing schedule in Imperian I’ll do it!” exclaimed Dias, his mind already fiercely debating how to break the news of his imminent departure to his three super model girlfriends. \r\n\r\n“Thank you, and you be careful out there,” the president said gratefully before dropping his voice to a whisper, “we need you alive for when we unveil your face on Mount Rushmore.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you worry about a thing Ba-Hus-O, I and the world will be safe so long as no one PK’s me in Imperian!” \r\n\r\n"

  content = "I'm not sure what subtle nuances of meaning you feel I failed do discern but if you're genuinely looking for constructive criticism I would say:\r\n\r\nAs an afftracking Malignist, you want to very clearly separate out the few afflictions you can track with a measure of consistency from the myriad of those you really can't. In the former category would be things like paralysis, asthma, anything with a 3rd party cure message and so forth. In the latter category will be the dozens of mental afflictions cured by orphine, mandrake and most painfully, focus. \r\n\r\nYou'll want to store these two lists in separate variables and use expressions with clearly defined logic to move things between them under certain circumstances. For example, if they've only got one mental affliction on them then you can safetly put it in the former list because you'll know that it's the one focus will target and so forth. Then, you'll want the output to your screen to look something like this:\r\n\r\nEnemy known afflictions: Paralysis, Asthma and Hemotoxin\r\nRecent afflictions: Stupidity and Vertigo\r\n\r\nIdeally you'd be wanting to keep the spam to a minimum. I used to use a free-floating window that would display their affliction status, what illusion combination I was using, what toxin list I was employing and so forth. You should also include code that will stop you from doubling up within your lists. This is fairly simple in both Lua and zScript so I assume it not being there is simply an oversight on your part. \r\n\r\nWith only evil-eye, you have to adjust your tactics a little because your opponent can safely use focus as much as he likes. Thus, your aff-tracking and smart-quer should have a different approach. Obviously you're not going to be taking out any top-tier fighters without a few more skills, but against lower and middle-tier you should be able to have a lot of success using a couple of fixed lists. If they don't have focus, you should be able to drown them in stupidity combined with orphine afflictions, with hemotoxin and metrazol on your daegger. If they do, you may well be able to overwhelm them anyway by aff-tracking your way to a stuck impatience. \r\n\r\nThat's the approach I'd take anyway..."

The way my system works is that if there's the off chance that an affliction might have been cured, I'll assume it as such, and then the highest priority afflictions which aren't currently affecting the target are reapplied.

Now I've been issued for being in the Modin graced harvesting, and lost because I failed to heed the warning of Zenigra. Demonology goes against what Khandavan's believe, and he is undead, forging with necromantic bone. \r\n\r\nHe makes himself look like the innocent party, but while I was running a caravan he killed me apparently for coming to his \"home\" or forge in the Yhurmara while he was graced and asked him to leave. He rejects grace and attacks any Khandavan he can find, then insults you when he does die, which in my opinion would warrant another death.\r\n\r\nI know I go off the deepend some times, but this is a case where he refuses to be wrong, and continues to instigate things that will cause his death as you can see. He needs to take a short break, get some air, sleep on it, and I'm sure as long as he doesn't provoke anything he'll be left alone (That includes finding another forge outside of Khandava's territory.\r\n\r\nTL;DR -> Don't instigate and play victim."

I vaguely remember a five page exchange where you vehemently argued that Verick is a skill-less hack. At the end of the day, we obviously have very different yardsticks.

These were two changes that affected basically only Assassins/Renegades (you couldn't glance blackwinded), who at the time were played by roughly 2 active combatants. I would argue that the 'democratic' nature of the classlead system at the time meant that the far more populous cleric guild simply out-voted us. \r\n\r\nI've still yet to have anyone adequately explain to me why a class with multiple forms of passive healing, the best active affliction healing in the game and a bread and butter attack which can be used while disabled needs instant diagnose too. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I think we should stop because we both know where this is headed. We're going to trade insults for a while, and if you feel you're coming off as a moron, you'll post \"LOLOL, I WAS JUST TROLLING!\" and declare victory. \r\n\r\nAll the best mate,\r\n- Saggy\r\n"

You're whining about a class perk that you see as overpowered.  Guess what? I don't like that Bards have an ability that turns Spiritwrack against me and forces me to use a hugely draining ability to prevent it, or the fact that they have immunity to two of my bread and butter abilities when they have permanent fear and recklessness immunity via songs.

A decent healing system combined with lifevision, aspect-life-vision, active healing, passive healing or just occasionally curing paralysis and touching tree made killing anyone competent a hugely uphill struggle. \r\n\r\nI know you often say that Priest takes skill because your offense basically requires you to maneuver them into not shielding the absolve (because of recklessness) or not preventing the judge (by panicking or off-timing). Assassin required that a person either not cure Sun Allergy for sixty (60) seconds or Ciguatoxin long enough for me to garrote them to death (often a long time). Please believe me when I tell you that making either of these two things happen on a competent player was hugely difficult, especially as a level 82~ Ssylsin/Fast with no defensive artifacts. \r\n\r\nStill, much as you did with bards and vodun-wytchen, I worked hard and secured kills. I know you routinely question my competence and there's not much I can say to change your mind. I guess I would say that I think some of the people on your list like Dregaur, Eldreth and Silken might be willing to vouch for my competence. I worked hard and killed people of every class and every profession, when they made mistakes... except priests. \r\n\r\nI was more confident of securing a kill on Life-Aspect Siath (0.01%)than I was on Cardi. I was more confident of securing a kill on Eldreth (0.01%)than I was on like... Malikir. I agree that there are class imbalances that are never going away no matter how hard we try. Please take it from someone who worked very, very hard to be the best Assassin they could be when I say that instant-diagnose was simply too much, and something that from my experience playing a Cleric, they can easily afford to train for offensive upgrades.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  "

I felt this would retain the flavor of the Assassin as an affliction dealer that focused on deception without forcing everyone (except Clerics) to write 40,000 lines of code.

It needs to be replaced entirely but piecemeal striking down what makes it actually decent is not something I can support. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your illusion removal and upgrade of hypnosis assuming you also upgrade hypochondria to about 66% chance of preventing a diagnose. That's a good compromise here,  one that gets you what you want with affecting Priests against other professions. One that I endorsed when they originally changed hypochondria to have a chance to prevent diagnose.\r\n\r\nAs I said in response to Khizan's post, replaced Healing with an edited form of Tarot. Getting rid of the Healing skillset is something that needs to happen to push the profession out of it's defensive heavy stalemate role and into something that's more balanced. Tarot has a nice mix of offensive, defensive and utility and would provide the hinder Priest needs.  This would also allow prone shield to go away as well as all active affliction healing, bedevil and instant diagnose. Moving the spiritshields to Fayth will ensure circle balance."

  content = "Okay @Guardian106 - No disrespect because I honestly have no clue who you truly are. People are saying Guardas, but I don't even know who that is. I've been playing roughly two months now. So far I can tell, I'm a Deathknight with lifevision and a few passive abilities such as - Gravehands, Deathaura. The rest is all up to afflictions which basically I either have to get a 224 speed sabre or better. ( This is with runes of course to balance to 231 which gives me a 2.0 balance. ) Though, if I basically obtain a 231 speed sabre I could do a 2.0 DSL which is 1 toxin per second. Adding Deathaura into the situation which basically ticks on the same as the TREE TATTOO. Even with lifevision, illusions aren't the main problem. Assassin /and/ or Renegade is basically an ambush class. I've seen Linelle, or Justus walk into the room and crush 3+ people alone. All tier 1 fighters with artifacts. I have 0 artifacts, and I'm double trans. I try to manage on my own, though it's quite rough. Shielding/aura only gets so far. When you add DARTS/COBRA into the situation it gets rough. Darts now break shield, I believe it's a 33% chance of breaking the shield? I could be mistaken... \r\n\r\nThough, as I have said... anyone basically as a FAST Assassin or Renegade can basically overload ANY profession other than Priest, Bards and Diabolists. ( because of their passive abilites / demons / and the overall evileye that can be used prone ) It's quite insane. I've been stacked with 20+ afflictions in over a 40 second period with my normal healing. I don't have purge or focus though it's the overwhelming fact that without an intimidation pet or cowardice I'm basically eating the herbs of what the cobra does on a normal tick. Adding DSTAB/DARTS into the situation causes problems. Honestly, I would say reduce the DSTAB speed... or remove the darts breaking the shield. Maybe if I had purge or focus I could put a strong suggestion into this table of - Expertness - as I haven't played as long. Though, like I said... the assassin/renegade profession honeslty in my own personal opinion is overpowered to all except the three professions I named. Not everything is balanced or matched properly. You will ocassionally be mis-matched. Though, it's the over-whelming factor alone that they crush basically 75%+ of this game... Even with fitness it's extremely hard for me to keep up with the afflictions. \r\n\r\nNow, Wardancers on the other hand... I've seen this dude Zyran... literally do a 1.5 flicking speed of two toxins... thats just insane. Herb eating is 3.0. He's basically doing 4 toxins on 1 herb balance. Adding double-dance which they now have it's basically unstoppable. The Sentinel dance also prevents their enemy from leaving the room - unless the defence is stripped which is race depending on the opponent. Or - Prisming/blackwind/astralform/pathfinder/ the list is endless.... Though, going back to the factor that he or she would deal a 1.5 speed of two toxins prevents EITHER of those. Basically, the person who is stupid enough to stay in the room - other than priests, bards, assassins, or renegades is utterly retarded. Now, I also have some questions and problems in-regards with my own profession and I need some help. If anyone coule please send me some advice and feedback it would be appreciated. Thank you ~Raij"

Don't fight in dart traps. When you get the lessons, teach your hound intimidate.  This is necessary anyways for bards unless you like eating sketches. I'd suggest consulting a DK combatant for more in-depth advice.\r\n\r\nNot to offend you but, Linelle and Justus both have tons of artifacts and know what they're doing. You can't really rate yourself against them.  Their dstabs are much quicker than normal. They may kill Tier one people with artifacts but both of them have been playing a long time. When I say \"higher tier combat\" I don't mean the ingame tiers. I mean the player skill level. Artifacts != skill but skill+artifacts means things are going to get a bit deadly. \r\n\r\nYou really need to keep learning before you can contribute to this conversation. You'll come to realize that no matter what profession the top folks are, they're going to kill 75% of the people in the game. They have invested significant time and money to have that advantage. As for Wardancer flicking,  yes it's a bit ridiculous and maybe needs to be looked at but again, you're still missing focus and purge."

  content = "1. Guardas is right (I had to copy paste that letter by letter from separate web-pages because my fingers spasm'd at the strangeness of typing it), Focus, faster tree balance and Purge make a difference so large as to defy description. Having focus means a Saboteur basically can't use mental afflictions on you without hypnotizing the impatience first because they just melt off instantly. Stupidity is ridiculously powerful if you dont' have focus to deal with it. Likewise, the Saboteur DSTAB speed of 3.00 is designed around herb balance + purge. Against herb balance alone, it can be overwhelming. \r\n\r\n2. I don't know whom these Tier 1 people are that Linelle and Justus are beating 1v3 but I can pretty confidently state they're doing something incredibly wrong. Nira and I used to take on groups of like 7-8 people, but we relied on those people being retarded. The whole thing fell apart as soon as Silken showed up and started teaching people basic combat logic like, \"If you're having trouble with the meanie Saboteur illusion spammers, have someone step out of the room and axe-stun them into oblivion.\" \r\n\r\n3. As a DK without an artifact weapon you're going to struggle to kill an assassin  because their dodge rate is so high and they have shrugging. I would almost go so far as to suggest using a pair of longswords or some other high to-hit weapon and aiming for a vivisect if you're finding the dodge-rate to be utterly crippling in securing the quad break. DK vs Assassin is a brutal matchup though. \r\n\r\n4. Fast affliction rates are scary, but you have to take a step back and consider which afflictions are truly fatal to you. Make sure that your system eliminates sun allergy, toxin relapse and paralysis on a high priority an assassin will struggle very hard to kill you. With fitness you are essentially immune to toxin locks and with putrefaction you can't be put to sleep (is this still the case?). A wardancer can stack all the afflictions he likes, as soon as he switches away from his tickle-sabres and onto his slower, damaging weapons, a diagnose and a good priority queue should have the afflictions melting off you. Once the paralysis is gone, a few vigours may be needed to keep you up, but that's about it. \r\n\r\n5. The reason assassin's run around gutterstomping 95% of Imperian is that they rely on a mechanic that is counterable only by having a very well written, custom system, having instant diagnose or having a huge volume of passive affliction healing or disable. The caveat to this is that assassins will bounce the hell off the other 5% like they hit a wall at full speed. It's a dumb mechanic and it always has been. "

As I said, I'm not extremely well fond of the entire realms combat system. But even teaching my own intimidate, gaining focus, perma tree, and purge blood. It's still a ridiculous amount of afflictions. And not fighting them in DARTS. Yes, I can see where you are coming from basically fighting in DARTS is death I get that. But when you HAVE too fight them in darts. via Arena Matches, or defending your city/Council you have too. I hate to say it, but I'd seriously like to see the affliction rate dropped down a little or removing the darts ability to immobilize shielding abilities completely. \r\n\r\n@Dgroz - Yes, I understand that. Though as the same principles apply to all three of you. I'm still learning and now my entire client has looped causing my system to go faulty. Now I'm back to scratch and I believe I won't even be combat ready for another month or so. I basically only had the typical afflictions and abilities. Over time and dedication I'm sure I will completely finish it. But the fact remains that it's time consuming and adding real life shit is making me do: HEAD-DESK. I honestly believe for the people who have spent real life currency into this game and the constant updating of the system is by far the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I'd rather go sit on my ass and play MW2 or MGS4. Even the ocassional LoL or SC2 is fine. Though, my assistance in the game and my current role in the Noctusari has left me to just steadily keep going. I'm probably going to stay out of combat for a while and just move into politics and heavy roleplaying. \r\n\r\n@Everyone - I appreciate all the advice and feedback, but stay safe and please trolling or raging over people. I understand that some of you may be experienced Imperian fighters or knowledeable in the game period.

If I were gonna go out, I'd go out HUGE!!!! Why bother being a lil lamiran male either. Not my style. If I'd go I'd go as Lyla or, even better, as Sasha, the one that this whole 6+ year mess started with. All because Dias couldn't have her. Oh, you never told that one did you? Where you asked her to break the engagement and to leave Xohln and she said no, how you offered her thousands of dollars to leave him and she said no. When that didn't work you went OOC and told Xohln she cheat on him with Dias to break them up. Didn't tell them that's the kind of asshole you are did you? Trying to destroy me like that. Got news kid. Yer not worth going green over. Now. Excuse me but I have to get back to anything better to do then deal with a supposed Military guy who I am ashamed to say doesn't act or behave like one. OH! Happy Veteran's Day!!!!"

  content = "I realize this may not be the thread for it, but I have to speak out. Runi’s poignant and eloquently worded issue is a call to arms I cannot ignore. I can stay silent no longer, I must share my dreadful story. \r\n\r\n----\r\nMy day does not begin as yours does. As the narrowest sliver of sun breaks over the horizon and I begin to stir from the giant pile of my parents credit cards on which I sleep, the nightmare truly begins. With a crash, all four newly repaired windows of my bedroom shatter inward as a crack team of ninjas rappels through them, Kayden at their head. I know it’s Kayden because he’s riding a unicorn, trailing rainbows and constantly making sarcastic remarks about Obama’s commitment to gay rights issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Back you tastefully dressed fiend!” I scream frantically, horror making my voice shrill. “I’m not going to play Imperian today, it’s clear I’m not wanted and it just leads to problems, I’m going to find a new hobby,” I protest in vain as they seize me and drag me toward my computer. \r\n\r\nIt’s futile. Within moments I’m bound to my chair and the Imperian loading screen flashes before me. Their dreadful deed done, Kayden and the ninjas disappear, leaving behind traces of broken glass, glitter and the last few bars of “it’s raining men.” \r\n\r\nThough I know it’s futile, I still unconsciously fight the inevitable. I think to myself, “I’ll keep my head down today, maybe do some bashing, a bit of city defense, not antagonize anyone...” No sooner had I finished forming the thought than the western wall of my house crashed inward. There in the breach, like an avatar of terror conjured by the imagination of an angry god stood Ahkan, ensconced as always in his mighty hamster ball. I cowered as he looked down at me and commanded, “Thou shalt be douchey!” Unable to resist that awesome will and knowing that if I did, he’d probably make a forum post declaring victory anyway, I hastened to make an ass of myself all over Imperian. \r\n\r\nHours and hundreds of dumb acts later, I stare through tear filled eyes at the screen and realize I can take no more. With leaden hands, I decide to retreat to the Imperian forums, a place famous for its intelligence, understanding and civility. “I shall post something constructive or amusing,” I decide, “perhaps an insightful comment about balance that acknowledges that my knowledge is less than total and that there might be other points of view.” I determine to post my comment with good grammar, a gentlemanly tone and a functioning sense of self irony. Yet once more, I am thwarted. \r\n\r\nLight seems to drain from the room as the darkness flows together, coalescing into a writhing ball of shadow. From within the boiling nether steps Sadie, shrouded as always in a powerful haze of gender ambiguity and not dating Sagron. Like a storied dark king/queen of yore Sadie points toward me and tendrils of stupidity flow through my mind, dulling my thoughts and making my comments stupid, ignorant and whiny. \r\n\r\n----\r\nThat is just a snapshot of the horrors I face daily. Bless you Runi, for finally giving me the strength to speak out about the nightmare that is my reality. \r\n"

I lived on a Marine Base and knew some of the nastiest, foulest military men on earth to at least be able to treat women with some modicum of respect.  You call yourself by all kinds of military titles and I call \"bullshit\" because from everything I have ever seen of you you neither keep to any kind of military kind of trainking regarding the respect of others, you lack self-control, and you spend way too much time playing online for someone who is active duty.  I was a military wife.  Yes, WAS, make all the cracks you like.\r\n\r\nFinally, I DO have epilepsy, I'm not ashamed.  I was ashamed for quite some time, because it IS embarrassing to not have control over my body; but it's an illness, like the flu, like cancer.  Yes, like cancer.  My case is progressive.  I'd rather not talk about that here.  So make fun of it, I can't really stop you, just like I can't wish myself better.  You can accuse me of making it up all you like and I wish to Gods it was all pretend so that I could wake up one day and be better.  I won't respond to any more of your barbs, comments or jibes.  You can say what you like here and elsewhere, but I'm done.  I don't have the time or energy for some little kid like you.  When I first met you I offered you the same thing I offer anyone - a bit of kindness, an open mind; and you took it and offered hurt and cruelty; much like the characters we play in our game.  Except I'm not immortal here, and I really am sick, and just don't feel like dealing with whatever darkness you let grow inside of you.  I just don't have it in me.  Take care of yourself, Jordan."

And when Vanmoriel wanted to speak as an Erege and bard secretary on the matter, Dias refused to let her speak, moved the meeting with Nasr and myself to his home in Kaark, which fails every security measure cause at least two rooms weren't totemed and monlithed. And when she moradeimed in, Dias told her she had 30 seconds to get out or else. He threatened to kill an Erege who has all the powers of the ministry's including housing, so if she wanted to look at his house, she could, and he threatened her with violence. And I still couldn't keep the position. For crying out loud, I didn't even immediately oust and enemy people, I was going to keep it lawful, unlike what they are doing.

Battlecry with a diadem and as intelligent/capable is 4.04 seconds at it's fastest and the stun time is only two seconds. If unconscious time for this is two seconds, make the balance time 4 seconds to do this attack at it's fastest. That way, you can still use it to stop instant kills and it will be useful in team fights but you won't have to spend an entire fight wondering when you can ever get a chance to parry head and be conscious again. Also, I'd say do the same thing for hunter trip so you don't spend the fight being stunned until the butterfly transfixes you, giving them the chance to impale an drag you through traps.\r\n"

Anyone who has ever spent thirty seconds in any online game other than a MUD will tell you that homophobic slurs are utterly endemic. Further, there aren't a lot of IC ways to punish someone for language that's not offensive to an IC persona, but is to an OOC persona. Most people will agree that they'd prefer to play in a game where OOC hate-speech isn't tolerated but wouldn't like to play in a game where individual predetermined emotes that are, by the way, entirely inline with the character of the too doing them are met with issues.

However, I think the people who have given up their characters to play Gods do deserve some benefit of the doubt, so I'll aim to keep this criticism constructive.  \r\n\r\nI think the player behind Shallah missed a real opportunity here to develop her God persona. \r\n\r\nHere's how I would have played it:\r\n\"I am the Goddess of peace and love, and I would of course never come down on anyone who revels in the latter, no matter their location. However, to ME, the rampant public displays of affection that so often fill these streets are  not a celebration of love, but a cheapening of it. What value the kiss of a soulmate when tongues intertwine between mere acquaintances on every corner? How does one show their love of a comrade with a genuine embrace if all around, forms romp and snuggle in the sand by way of greeting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Though I do not question your intentions or your reverence for Love, I fear that you are obscuring it in the fog of your public displays of affection. I would also remind those of you who have known true love that the firm squeeze of a hand from a soulmate is every bit as reassuring of their love as a thousand kisses.\" "

There is absolutely no way it's the same player.\r\n\r\nIt's a new player in the shell trying to flex... and not only doing it poorly, but also making a fool of the god, the god's role, and the entire Order and Congregation. Sure, I get to not come down on gods because of what they do for the game. I am all for giving them the OOC respect and appreciation they more than deserve - and I try to msg each and every god I interact with to let them know that I do appreciate and look forward to such interactions. This, however? I'm at a complete and total loss for words, and anyone who knows me know how infrequently that happens.\r\n\r\nImperian is an RP-PvP game. Don't like it? I'm sure you can find a BDSM or fetish MUD out there somewhere that you'd fit in much better with. Don't let the door hit you on the way out. Better yet? Let it."

Now, obviously that's mechanically impossible but from the point of RP, that's what they're all meant to be striving toward. \r\n\r\nA world where Anti-Magick defeated Demonic and Magick would be a peaceful one, or at least one in which the Shallahites could openly preach peace to everyone and work toward that end. \r\n\r\nRather than haranguing the AM fighters for fighting, the Shallahites should be cheering them on. If they want to maintain their personal pacifism while doing so, I guess that's fair enough but only the most extra-crunchy nutbar pacifists openly attack those who are literally keeping hordes of demoners from drowning their city in blood.

You cannot kick anyone out of the guild that is voting until after the elections are over. \r\n\r\nIf your guild had a no favoring policy, that is your call. Although one side promoting players just to vote for them is pretty lame. Inactive players that return can vote, as long as they meet the coded activity rules for voting. Bringing a second back just to vote and then quitting is pretty stupid too.\r\n\r\nAdministration does not normally regulate guildmaster votes and we are not going to start now.
