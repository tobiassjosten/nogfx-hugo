Although a variety of trees might actually\r\ngrow here, the black tar that coats them renders them indistinguishable. A thin black mist creeps \r\nbetween the trees, hanging low across the ground. The floor of the clearing itself is simply bare \r\nearth, cracked and dry. Overshadowing all is the Master Ravenwood Tree itself, jutting into the sky \r\nlike a twisted fist.

Moulds and fungi are smeared across the plants, their\r\npungent stench suffusing the forest. The branches are coated in dark slime, slick tendrils that hang\r\ndownwards. Although a variety of trees might actually grow here, the black tar that coats them \r\nrenders them indistinguishable. A thin black mist creeps between the trees, hanging low across the \r\nground. The floor of the clearing itself is simply bare earth, cracked and dry. Overshadowing all is\r\nthe Master Ravenwood Tree itself, jutting into the sky like a twisted fist. The sound of laughing \r\ncrows echoes down from the treetops, a harsh sound for the ears below. The atmosphere vibrates with \r\na palpable power.

Tall, blackened trees surround this clearing, pressing together\r\ninto an imposing barrier of rotten vegetation. Moulds and fungi are smeared across the plants, their\r\npungent stench suffusing the forest. The branches are coated in dark slime, slick tendrils that hang\r\ndownwards. Although a variety of trees might actually grow here, the black tar that coats them \r\nrenders them indistinguishable. A thin black mist creeps between the trees, hanging low across the \r\nground. The floor of the clearing itself is simply bare earth, cracked and dry. Overshadowing all is\r\nthe Master Ravenwood Tree itself, jutting into the sky like a twisted fist. The sound of laughing \r\ncrows echoes down from the treetops, a harsh sound for the ears below. The atmosphere vibrates with \r\na palpable power.
